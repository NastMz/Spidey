at the age of 23, having recently graduated from the computer engineering course at the state university of campinas (unicamp), césar gon opened a startup focused on software development with two college friends, bruno guiçardi and fernando matt, who continue to run the business . thus, in 1995, ci&t was born. “it was a different time, with the beginning of the commercial internet as a business tool in brazil and around the world”, recalls gon, now 47 years old. the company prospered, internationalized and became a multinational with offices in the united states, canada, united kingdom, china and japan. more than 2.800 people work at the company, which expects to reach r$1 billion in revenue in 2020 and was elected the main google partner worldwide from 2014 to 2016. today, ci&t's main offering is no longer custom-made software for corporate clients. “two years ago, we created a methodology, called lean digital transformation, to help brands born in the 20th century adapt to the business environment of our century.” in this interview given at prisma, the name of the building that houses the company in campinas (sp), gon explains the company's new business proposal and tells the secrets of the trajectory of a brazilian startup that transformed into a global company. what is the lean digital transformation that you offer to the market? the objective of this proposal is to change processes and the culture of corporate environments of major brands born in the 20th century, so that they have the agility required in the digital era of the 21st century. we want to help corporations on this transformation journey, adding value that can impact their business. no company, no matter how successful it may have been in the past, can do without redesigning itself from the customer's perspective. it is no surprise that the presidents of the largest companies in the world understand digital transformation as a cultural challenge, and not just a technological one. what is this methodology based on? it is based on three elements: change in the way the company designs and builds digital solutions based on the lean philosophy [see explanation below]; transformation of its management system with the adoption of short learning cycles; and redesign of the leadership model, without fear of making mistakes. these three components make the company's digital transformation, which will become faster, more innovative and customer-focused. obviously, this applies to the technology area. you can't compete in the modern world without software and information being the heart of your business. but we need to go beyond technology and promote a change in culture and way of thinking. why is it important for brands to make this transition? competition between companies in the 21st century is obsessively focused on the speed with which, through data analysis, we understand, serve and surprise the customer. but large corporations are slow by nature and are not prepared for this reality . they look to the side and see an amazon, a google or an apple, which were born in the digital environment and are much faster than them. with a presence in brazil, the united states, canada, the united kingdom, china and japan, the company expects to reach r$1 billion in revenue in 2020 is it not just a matter of adapting to new technologies, but of establishing a new relationship with consumers? undoubtedly. the way we relate to brands is radically different from 10 years ago. our desire is more volatile, we have less attachment to tradition. we want to know if that brand solves our problems, if it understands us and treats us in a unique way. the possible way out is to truly connect in this volatility, in this uncertainty. where did you get inspiration to create this proposal? the lean method originates from the word “lean” in english, and emerged in the production lines of the japanese automaker toyota in the 1980s. it proposed implementing a more simplified process flow, aiming to reduce waste of resources – materials, time, labor work etc. – and increasing added value for the customer. we were inspired by this method to expand customers’ digital skills. in practice, how does this transition happen? the program is long-term, but with short goals. we want the company to learn to think in smaller business cycles, of three months. what can you do in this time? changing the learning dynamics of companies. could you give examples of a client who goes through this process? our portfolio in brazil has 30 large corporations, including coca-cola, itaú, raízen and cielo. at coca-cola, we are helping to implement a set of principles to change the way it organizes itself, connects with the public and solves consumer problems. this means shortening the release cycle, going from two or three years to three or four months. has the company already launched products on this innovation trail? yes. the first was a line of family juices, which hit the market along with digital tools that collect data on the product's receptivity. the second was a natural soft drink, a new category in the world. basically, we don't want to create mass products, like coke zero, but to understand the habits of each consumer. if coca-cola can be a machine for understanding, experimenting and launching, with a data-driven culture, it will become more intelligent and closer to the consumer. ci&t has also undergone a transformation process since its creation, right? the company was born in 1995 focused on software engineering at the beginning of the commercial internet as a business tool. we viewed the internet as a gateway and specialized in specific technologies. our focus was the national market. this first chapter of our history lasted about 10 years. then the internationalization process began. leo ramos chaves campinas (sp) is home to one of the four ci&t development centers in the world what was the transition like from a startup focused on brazil to a global company? in the 2 000s, anyone who wanted to participate in the information technology industry game on a global level needed to have a classification seal for software manufacturers, called cmmi [acronym for integrated capability maturity model]. we were the first brazilian company to obtain it, in 2004. from then on, we signed contracts in the united states. how did this happen? we got there by offering customized software, but the business environment, especially in silicon valley, showed that this was an outdated model. the industry of the future was one of innovation. it was necessary to master a set of technologies and discover how they could create disruptions for companies and consumers. the business no longer meant sitting around waiting for demand. it was necessary to provoke the customer with technological opportunities and propose solutions and innovations. at that time, around 2006, social media, smartphones, cloud computing and the entire arsenal of big data began to emerge. these forces changed what could be done with technology from a consumer perspective. certainly. we now have billions of people with a device that fits in their pocket connected through social media, generating billions of data. there was also a drop in computational costs and the advent of artificial intelligence techniques. this changed the game. it was no longer possible to design software like before. the possibilities were different. how did you adapt to that moment? we reduce bureaucracy in the way software is produced and create another value offer for the market. we overcome the business model by specification and technical design and start working plugged into the client's problems. the engineering team approached the business team. proactively, we presented customers with technological possibilities that would allow them to generate digital assets and experiences. it was the second chapter of ci&t, which lasted until 2017, when we created the lean digital transformation proposal. how does prisma, the company's headquarters in campinas, fit into this new phase? prisma is a digital transformation co-creation space opened in 2016. part of the cultural change we propose involves creating collaborative environments, where people exchange ideas and release what we call collective intelligence. it is necessary to physically dismantle staid corporate environments and create new spaces with fewer symbols of power and hierarchy – something that is already happening in silicon valley. in the coming months, we will create a second ci&t prisma in california. will it house ci&t's business unit in the united states? yes. we already serve motorola, johnson & johnson and google, among other clients. for google, we create finance and marketing software, but our relationship is as a partner, notably in machine learning and cloud computing. leo ramos chaves opened at the end of 2016, the company's central building has environments that encourage co-creation ci&t is present in which markets?  united states, canada, china, japan and europe, notably in england. half of the revenue, of more than r$600 million in 2018, is generated in brazil and the rest abroad, mainly in the united states, with around 85% of international revenue. here, the entire portfolio is digital transformation, but abroad this offer represents 65% of the total – the rest are contracts focused on innovation. in two years, we should have 100% of the portfolio in this value proposition. how is the company growing? in the last 15 years we have doubled in size every three years, on average, and we want to reach r$1 billion in 2020, keeping more than 50% of the business abroad. the foreign market is a competitive ruler, since the united states is the first division of our industry. we have to win the game there. how is the r&d sector structured? in the digital world, the traditional vision of r&d is absolutely anachronistic, in which you have a laboratory with phds, disconnected from the customer's reality, creating things of value. try to find the r&d area of   google or amazon. it's impossible. each google engineer is an innovation cell. that's how i like to think about ci&t. the word r&d has never been applied to the software industry. and as every industry is becoming a software industry, it applies less and less. so, what is the role of ci&t development centers? these centers, located in campinas, belo horizonte, tokyo, in japan, and nimbo, in china, concentrate intensive human capital processes for the production of clients' digital platforms, such as applications, e-commerce portals, databases for big data it is analytics . belo horizonte is our export hub focused on remote technologies and services destined for the united states. campinas focuses on the financial, retail and e-commerce areas. the centers in china and japan develop technologies for smartphones and e-commerce. we have six other business units. in total, there are more than 2.800 employees, 120 in the united states, 100 in china, 40 in japan and around 10 in europe. how much do you invest in innovation and how big is the team dedicated to it? can't answer. recently, google, facebook and silicon valley companies announced that they would no longer require an engineering degree. here at ci&t, our talent attraction processes have been hands on , an expression in english that means “come here, work with us, develop solutions and see if it makes sense to work together”. does the diploma, then, make no difference? our hiring has little to do with a degree, although most of the employees come from unicamp and usp [university of são paulo]. but that's not the starting point. in selection processes, we prioritize candidates' skills, learning speed and ability to collaborate in a multicultural work environment, with respect for diversity. for us, that's what matters.  this text was originally published by fapesp research according to the creative commons license cc-by-nc-nd . read the original here .  césar  gon: on the path to digital transformation | photo: felipe christ overview project report research snapshot research team publications contact an analysis of unequal connectivity in carlton housing estate, melbourne, victoria this project was funded by a melbourne social equity institute 2020 seed funding grant and by the australian communications consumer action network (accan). australia has some of the best internet coverage globally, and yet in 2018 approximately 2.5 million australians had no internet connection. this reveals significant limitations in access, digital ability, and affordability, despite major infrastructure investments (accan, 2021). while recent research suggests that these numbers have dropped due to the online demands that arose during the covid-19 pandemic (acma, 2021), access, affordability, and adequacy of connection for some citizens remain out of reach due to a range of barriers. to ensure that everyone has equal opportunity to use digital technologies, and thus to ensure access to social and economic opportunities and essential government services, targeted investments to reduce digital inequality are necessary. digital inclusion in australia is influenced by a person’s income, age, education level, and residential location. this report demonstrates that digital inequality is not measured by access to internet alone, but also by quality of service and internet providers’ accountability in the face of poor customer experience. focus on the national broadband network (nbn) in australia has led policymakers to overlook the many people who access the internet predominantly with their smartphones or who rely on their smartphones to augment poor home internet connections. the roll out of the nbn has led many to assume that high quality internet has been brought into everyone’s reach. this assumption means that the consequences of poor connectivity risk becoming less visible, and exacerbates concerns for the people who continue to experience digital exclusion. working with principles of co-design with community partners and carlton public housing residents, we conducted a case study of how people manage digital inequality. our data analysis revealed that people were not as digitally connected during the pandemic and ensuing lockdowns as the services upon which they depended assumed they were. online home-schooling demanded a 1:1 device to person ratio and many low-income families needed to buy or request assistance to meet this demand. additional constraints were felt in access to employment, and in essential services such as health and income support (centrelink). download the 44-page report including the executive summary and recommendations.   download: download the understanding digital inequality report (pdf) a two-page summary of the understanding digital inequality research report is available in six languages. amharic አማርኛ.pdf   arabic  العربية.pdf   cantonese 廣東話.pdf   english.pdf   oromo afaan oromo.pdf   vietnamese tiếng việt.pdf   dr nicky dulfer , melbourne graduate school o f education catherine smith , melbourne graduate school of education dr ellen van holstein , school of school of geography, earth and atmospheric sciences / rmit dr alice garner , melbourne graduate school of education lia acosta rueda,  school of social and political sciences lloyd rouse, school of social and political sciences sabah hamed, melbourne graduate school of education kerrii cavanagh, community projects officer, strategy and culture associate professor leah ruppanner , school of social and political sciences dr marc cheong , school of computer and information systems fiona darling, city of melbourne fiona addison, city of melbourne louise caddell, city of melbourne natasha savic, yarra libraries and australian digital inclusion alliance elle morrell, carlton neighbourhood learning centre sarah deasey, carlton neighbourhood learning centre khadra omar, myplace sally beattie, myplace bich-hoa ha, cohealth sahil puri,  unilodge van holstein, e., dulfer, n., smith, c., garner, a.

minute read land rights are the cornerstone of world economies. university of melbourne researchers are helping the indonesian government modernise their land information system. the road map towards better land administration is based on local needs as well as international best practices. university of melbourne researchers have prepared a customised road map of 21 projects to modernise every aspect of indonesia’s land information system for the indonesian ministry of land affairs and spatial planning (kementerian agraria dan tata ruang / badan pertanahan nasional) modern land information systems give clarity around land rights and support land administration, sustainable development and urban planning the university of melbourne’s centre for spatial data infrastructures and land administration (csdila) has previously worked on similar projects with the victorian government, the world bank and the united nations committee of experts for global geospatial information management (un-ggim). “the centre for spatial data infrastructures and land administration team is helping the indonesian government to move from paper-based land administration to digital-based land administration,” says professor abbas rajabifard , the lead of the land information modernisation project. land administration connects physical information about the land’s features with legal information about the rights, restrictions and responsibilities. this is done through a series of steps and protocols – all of which the research team has considered for modernisation. based on the indonesian government’s vision and international best practices, professor rajabifard and his team have developed a customised road map of 21 projects to modernise indonesia’s land information system. the partnership has also included training and capacity building across the range of people involved in indonesian land administration processes, from land surveyors to government executives. “we are grateful for the training organised by csdila in 2020, which provided us with the opportunity to gain knowledge from csdila's experts in the field of land management and cadastre. this knowledge has allowed us to solidify our practical knowledge and increase the capacity of our staff to assist in the organisation of various activities in the ministry,” says himawan arief sugoto, senior advisor to the minister. the university of melbourne team is now working on a pilot for a modernised land information system, called smartland indonesia . land rights form the basis of world economies . modernising land administration gives clarity around land rights. in disasters like floods or landslides, paper records can be lost or destroyed. the government may not know who the land rights should be returned to. digital records also allow more information to be stored and connected. and having complete land information available across jurisdictions is important for emergency management, urban planning and land managem ent. it could reveal a community’s resilience to natural disasters. for example, a community could be at risk of flooding due to the land’s topography and have poor access to road networks to escape. modern land information systems can also power sustainable development. digital records allow governments to better analyse how land is distributed. “the equal access to services and facilities is one part of the sustainable development indicators,” says professor rajabifard. many of the united nations’ 17 sustainable development goals are connected to land. better land information allows better measurement of progress towards those goals. the world bank recognises land rights as a cornerstone of world economies. in 2018 and 2019, it sent a group of indonesian executives to melbourne for a workshop on best practices in land administration and what modernisation of land administration looks like. the indonesian ministry of agrarian affairs and spatial planning asked the university of melbourne team to support their project management office on their land system modernisation journey. “we started exploring all the business processes on different levels – like the federal government, the regional, and also the local governments – in different jurisdictions across the entire indonesia,” says dr soheil sabri , the manager of the land information modernisation project. many changes are needed for a fully modernised land information system – even in law. “for example, in the indonesian context, the land title should be printed and stamped by the legal office,” dr sabri says. to fully digitise the indonesian land administration system, that law would need to change. the road map built by the university of melbourne proposed a suite of projects to address similar challenges and opportunities, modernising all aspects of the land administration workflow. beyond digitising a paper-based system, smartland indonesia may eventually integrate digital twin technology. a digital twin – a virtual representation of real-world entities and processes, synchronised with its real-world equivalent – could help convert a 2d land information system into 3d, giving a more holistic view of structures such as high-rise buildings in areas like jakarta. learn more about infrastructure research the centre for spatial data infrastructures and land administration (csdila) was established in 2001. csdila was funded by the victorian government land office to explore transitioning its paper-based land administration to a digital system. the victoria eplan was a pilot project launched in 2016 in partnership with land use victoria. it focused on the automatic validation of data collected and submitted to the land office. “that is one of the flagship projects that converted the research into practice. over those five years, the team has learned a lot of new knowledge and generated that knowledge as a repository for moving forward in different directions,” says professor rajabifard. develope d countries like australia and developing countries like indonesia face different challenges in land administration. but work on the victoria eplan project helped csdila contribute to international land administration frameworks for the world bank and the united nations global geospatial information management (un-ggim). these frameworks are internationally recognised references for developing, renewing, reforming, strengthening, modernising or monitoring land information systems. they help countries achieve sustainable development goals. work on these international land administration frameworks led to the csdila’s introduction to un and world bank member states, including the indonesian government. indonesian ministry of land affairs and spatial planning (kementerian agraria dan tata ruang / badan pertanahan nasional) centre for spatial data infrastructures and land administration at

of carbon emissions. our expert panel discussed how we’ll reduce the climate impact of the built environment.  the legal profession is finally experiencing the digital disruption that has swept through so many industries over the last decade. it’s transforming all aspects of lawyering, creating new ways of working in new markets with new roles and opening up new opportunities while traditional conventions wane. law graduates who understand the impact of digital innovations and are comfortable working with technology will be at an advantage with employers. so legal education needs to provide students with the technical skills to thrive in the digital world, and also the ability to navigate the complex ethical, legal and social implications of new technologies. while our future lawyers need to work in a digital world, it remains all the more important to recognise the value of some important elements of traditional legal education including research, critical thinking and analytical skills. this blend of old and new capabilities is the best chance we have to thrive in a rapidly changing world. there are areas where the digital transformation will be significant; we’re already seeing the impact in discovery, where artificial intelligence is both replacing work product from lawyers and at the same time improving the experience of law practice. other changes might create new types of legal work in new markets, for example, providing online high volume, low cost advice to under-served constituencies. at melbourne law school, for example, the students in our law apps class work in teams with not-for-profit clients to develop on-line legal information sources to provide assistance to those who might otherwise struggle to understand their legal rights and duties. other aspects of the law, however, will remain more complex and nuanced and require greater human input than predicted by those who foresee the end of traditional law firms. as legal educators, we need to draw on the best of the past while being innovative about responding to the future. some of the traditional values of high quality legal education remain pertinent (maybe even increasingly so) in a rapidly changing world. these elements should not be sacrificed when looking at reforms although, the precise way in which they are taught may need some modification. the nature of legal research, for example, might be changing, but the need for high-quality research skills is not. a careless and ill-defined search can give rise to a torrent of barely relevant, unimportant materials from around the world. the poorly trained law graduate haplessly reproduces as much of it as possible hoping that the right answer will mysteriously arise from the sea of information. students must understand the questions they are researching; have a deep familiarity with the best research tools for the particular task; understand the hierarchies at play in terms of court structures and forms of law; and have good judgment about which sources to use and when. none of these skills is straightforward and all of them require a seriou s educational effort both in law school and in professional training. creating opportunities for serious, deep and structured interdisciplinary experiences is another important aspect of contemporary legal education. it is likely interdisciplinary groups will give rise to the most innovative workplaces and solve the most intractable problems of our time. for a profession in which development has tended to be evolutionary and incremental for much of its history, the legal profession is now faced with a pace of change that has put serious pressure on many lawyers. as law firms examine their practices and adjust to the new world, other competitors and new ways of providing legal advice emerge. the pattern of change and challenge to the existing ways of doing things is likely to continue indefinitely. law schools likewise face challenges in responding to this new environment. with the number of graduate places for young lawyers diminishing, they must focus on both readying their students for those places and also preparing them for other roles in which their knowledge and skills can be used. in adapting to meet these new challenges, it is important law schools recognise that some of the traditional skills they impart to students will continue to be valuable for a long time to come. but neither can they close their eyes to the environment into which students are graduating and they need to be innovative and responsive in creating opportunities for students to develop new skills sets that will set them up to succeed even as the expectations of lawyers continues to shift over time. to mark law week (15 – 21 may 2017), pursuit is looking at some of the issues facing the profession in the 21st century. banner image: lady justice by alex proimos from sydney, australia/ wikimedia can knowing too much harm us? when it comes to medicine, in some cases, yes, absolutely. finding and treating diseases early saves lives and reduces health costs. it is why health systems have been increasingly undertaking proactive screening – administering clinical tests on individuals who don’t have any symptoms but may be at risk. examples include screening for diseases like bowel cancer or breast cancer. the ubiquity of digital technologies in our lives has the potential to take proactive screening to a new level – digital screening. this involves using information collected by our smartphones, smartwatches, keyboards, social networks, and wearable technology and analysing it using artificial intelligence algorithms to identify at-risk individuals. for example, the early onset of parkinson’s disease could be identified from the changing patterns of how someone types , while the risk of heart problems can be identified from abnormal heart rhythms detected by a smartwatch. while all this may sound good, the problem is that proactive screening can find things that might not be worth finding. there is overwhelming evidence that some diagnostic tests used in screening can find abnormalities that, while meeting the current definition of a disease, might have never made some people sick. these ‘diseases’ that would have never generated any problems are what we call cases of overdiagnoses and can lead to unnecessary and sometimes harmful treatments. and the emergence of digital screening could make this problem worse. overdiagnosis as a phenomenon has been seen in many well-known diseases, from some common cancers to attention deficit disorder. the most common scenario of overdiagnosis is when we actively seek diseases in asymptomatic patients, especially among healthier segments of the population. for example in some countries screening for thyroid cancer has led to a two-fold increase in the incidence of thyroid cancer, but no change in mortality. in other words, the screening hasn’t reduced deaths. similarly, studies have shown that screening for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder in children can lead to simply the youngest children in a school class being diagnosed. overdiagnosis has been observed for many cancers, including prostate cancer and breast cancer, as well as conditions like chronic kidney disease, gestational diabetes, high blood pressure and autism spectrum disorder. the extent of overdiagnosis is difficult to quantify but one report has suggested that an estimated 18-24 per cent of all cancers in australia may be cases of overdiagnosis. one reason behind overdiagnosis is the constant advance of technology, with newer, more sensitive tests being developed. among the latest advances in medicine is the possibility of using the massive amount of data we generate every day to find clues that might point to undiagnosed diseases. throughout our day we use smartphones, type emails, interact on social media and count our steps on our  smartwatches. using artificial intelligence, the data can be used to find patterns that might help us detect diseases at an earlier stage. the collection and use of medical data raise ethical concerns, like those of privacy and data security. nonetheless, this is a very exciting time, and many benefits will probably emerge from these technologies. but just as with traditional diagnostic methods, overdiagnosis is still a risk that should be addressed. so, what can we do? in our recently published paper , we propose using data banks of longitudinal patient information – data collected over long periods of time – to analyse the historical trajectories of different diseases and identify those subgroups of patients who won’t be significantly affected, if at all, by a given disease. this data-driven approach could be used to improve disease definitions considering patient trajectories and identify the clinical attributes that might in the future allow clinicians to more accurately distinguish a diagnosis from an overdiagnosis. in a pilot study we conducted using a us hospital database with hundreds of thousands of hospital admissions, we trained an artificial intelligence algorithm to predict which patients were likely to develop sepsis in the next hours – sepsis is a complication of an infection in which the body’s own immune response begins to damage tissues and organs. we then looked at the patients flagged by the algorithm who actually went on to develop sepsis, based on official diagnostic criteria. among them, we found that almost 5 per cent of them had trajectories that appeared to be identical to those who never went on to develop sepsis. this suggests that we need more work on defining what is and what isn’t sepsis. the huge amounts of data that technology allows us to collect and analyse is an opportunity to better identify people early who need treatment before they become sick. but we also need to use big data to ensure we aren’t taking perfectly well people and turning them into sick patients. banner: getty images futurists tell us we are on the brink of a fourth industrial revolution. this one is all about the digital and technological disruption of how we used to do things. previous industrial revolutions saw many blue-collar manufacturing jobs replaced by machines, or disappear overseas to low-labour-cost countries. developed economies like australia successfully transitioned their labour force to white-collar service jobs. now these jobs are themselves under threat, and the financial services sector is not immune. many transactional services are moving online, or are being replaced by offshore call centres and, increasingly, by virtual services – robots or artificial intelligence systems. yet the finance sector has also embraced and thrived on the opportunities created by digital disruption. the traditional banking sector in particular is constantly challenged by new, nimble and highly competitive operators, and must either change the tune of its service provision or face commercial oblivion. the finance sector has in fact been remarkably resilient to change. in the ongoing capitalist battle of creative destruction, financial institutions seem to have had markedly greater longevity than manufacturing corporations. that could be explained by a sustained lack of competition, but it may also reflect an ability to adapt to new circumstances and adopt new technology like atms and internet banking, whenever and wherever they arise. there is no need for the financial establishment to significantly invest in research and development itself. banking corporations have adopted a similar strategy to big pharmaceuticals – let independent niche operators innovate and create start-ups and ventures, and when they succeed, simply buy them. for example, the successful australian upstarts specialising in low-cost mortgage lending (aussie and rams) were eventually bought by the traditional banks (cba and westpac, respectively). the sector’s resilience is not just due to an ability to cope remarkably well with external pressure. finance has become increasingly innovative and continuously reinvents itself to reduce the costs of regulation as well as the delivery of better products and services for customers. regulators and legislators often struggle to keep pace with the latest developments in investment assets, financial advice and risk management. that often leaves new providers operating in a regulatory vacuum that only gets filled once things have gone terribly wrong, or once lobbying pressure by the sector itself becomes too strong to ignore. the cost of unregulated innovation on the public could be significant. consider, for example, the fact that financial innovations like portfolio insurance and collateralised debt obligations contributed to the 1987 stock market crash and the 2007-08 global financial crisis, respectively. rather than wait for legislation and regulation to catch up, we should therefore ask ourselves whether the ethics underpinning these innovations  pass the morality test. digital technology will arguably improve market access for new (niche) financial institutions, as well as competition, and make markets and services more efficient. robot trading and advice can significantly reduce fees, improve transparency, and make financial services more accessible. there is even a suggestion that robot finance will democratise the sector and lead to a more just and fair financial system for all. human foibles and manifestations of conflicts of interest can simply be switched off. taking out human interaction could transform a possibly immoral finance sector to an entirely amoral one where moral considerations simply have no role to play. unfortunately, this dehumanisation of finance raises its own ethical concerns. as finance sector legislation/regulation often significantly lags developments and practices, how can we be sure that financial entrepreneurs even consider the ethical implications of their new business models? after all, financial institutions often innovate to reduce the cost of regulation on conducting financial transactions. these concerns extend from breaches of client information privacy to, more generally, neglect of a duty to clients. perhaps surprisingly, they seem to have increased with the introduction of digital technology service platforms. while the platforms are notionally neutral, they don’t recognise a client’s financial sophistication or lack thereof. this digital revolution is rapidly replacing physical markets and bank branches and employees with online platforms and smartphone technology. even the world of financial advice, which is still clinging to face-to-face transactions, might well be replaced by robot advice in the near future. the platforms are cheap to develop, easy to implement, and effectively marketed. this creates an entirely new competitive landscape, with start-ups and small players specialising in specific services instantly becoming competitive entrants. whereas regulators used to impose the same regimes on incumbents and newcomers, who were thereby disadvantaged, they now seem to provide regulatory exception to new initiatives. public distrust of the finance sector has weakened the lobbying power of the incumbents and convinced the regulators to encourage innovation and competition by newcomers. the price paid, however, is possibly unchecked unethical behaviour by the innovators. this is an edited extract from ‘a matter of trust: the practice of ethics in finance’ by paul kofman and clare payne, published by melbourne university press. more information is available here . banner image: getty images    3 minute read in a recent webinar, panellists discussed how the application of technology can address critical ecological and urban design issues, like adapting cities to climate change. modern city planning needs a great deal of data. big problems like adapting our cities to the impacts of climate change require complex solutions. digital technologies help urban designers pool different sources of data and consider their problems using systems thinking, rather than approaching them one project at a time. in our recent infrastructure webinar integrated design for resilient urban landscapes, four panellists in conversation with city of melbourne’s mark allan discussed how the application of technology can address critical ecological and urban design issues. watch webinar chief among the digital tools to tackle complex urban design issues are urban digital twins. a digital twin is a virtual representation of the built and natural environment of cities, the living entities with them, and the processes that make cities tick, like transport networks. “there are three main components in an urban digital twin,” said panellist dr soheil sabri , senior research fellow in urban analytics at the university of melbourne. dr sabri managed the fishermans bend digital twin project. the first urban digital twin component is the real world. the second is the digital world, where real-world objects and processes are represented. the third is the underpinning technology that connects the real world to the digital world and enables synchronisation between the two. why are they useful? an urban environment is a complex, dynamic environment where housing, environment, transport and many other factors work together. “any time you make a change to one, you’re affecting all eight or nine other systems that are at work on the streets and in our public realm,” said panellist dr nano langenheim , lecturer in landscape architecture and urban design at the university of melbourne. urban designers can use digital twins to plug in data from several different sources to understand how these systems interact. where relevant data is available in open data resources, urban planning projects could save time and money. however, researchers and planners often collect data for a specific purpose. data collected for understanding the free flow of traffic – while representing the same streets – may not have the information another researcher needs about footpath quality. “what we are seeing through digital transformation is certainly a pressure on maturity in the marketplace for … understanding what the information management requirements are at the end of the project,” said panellist mr james barrow, mixed reality and digital engineering lead at ghd. good data management standards that help define the type, accuracy, currency and purpose of data collected can ensure its longevity. and that longevity starts with curiosity about what other users’ needs are, mr barrow explained. ensurin g the usability of data beyond a single project increases its value. city planners are already tackling the impacts of climate change: increased rainfall, rising sea levels and increasing temperatures. the city of melbourne is using digital technologies and data in projects like increasing tree canopy cover and understanding the microclimates around the city to combat the effects of extreme heat events. “heat is in fact a more dangerous killer of people in australia than any other natural hazard,” said ms tiffany crawford, co-chief heat officer at the city of melbourne. but she believes the solutions to climate change are available. “what it now requires is different thinking, innovation and partnership. i think that the great minds watching this and present today are a big part of that. keep going!” ms crawford said. learn more about infrastructure research. first published on 26 january 2023.           technology continues to transform the practices of every organisation around the world. but if we look specifically at the legal profession, these digital transformations can bring unanticipated legal and ethical risks. in-house legal departments used to be viewed as a hallowed black box and, although it was unclear what they did, their decisions were highly regarded. in recent years, in-house lawyers have extended out into new areas of business, like environmental, social and governance, where they have a larger role in designing and influencing the rest of their company. general counsels are now devoting more time to strategic emphasis and less time to day-to-day business. as janet taylor-hall, chief executive of the legal service provider cognia law, states – in-house lawyers engage with the sales team or procurement department, sitting down with them to develop templates, contracts or negotiation rules. most importantly, there’s a been a major change in the deployment of technology by in-house legal departments to gather data. analysing this data can identify emerging trends and provide early notice of larger problems – like an increase in the number of new lawsuit claims. a 2021 report by the corporate legal operations consortium (cloc) shows more than half of the participants – around 66 per cent – answered that their organisation views the legal department as totally integrated into their strategy and business. according to only three per cent of respondents, the in-house legal department provides strictly legal advice. australian businesses are now at risk of significantly higher cyber attacks because of their reliance on web-based applications. but when it comes to cyber threat response, only 54 per cent of companies have a comprehensive cyber-threat response strategy that involves their legal departments. cyber breaches can result not only in significant financial loss but also in reputational damage. so, the intervention of a competent legal team can mitigate those risks. as an example of one of these privacy breaches, human rights watch (hrw) has accused adobe connect application and minecraft: education edition of violating their privacy policies and collecting children’s personal data for non-educational purposes. this highlights the need for in-house lawyers with extensive understanding of technology, who are able to predict potential legal breaches and guide their employers throughout the early stages of new technology development. australia’s privacy act , currently under review , is out of date in the digital age. while legislators attempt to amend and supplement the relevant legislation to become more adaptable to technological change, lawyers continue to face legal challenges related to evolving digitalisation and it’s hard to say if these adaptions of the law really go far enough. recently, consumer group choice investigated whether australian retailers kmart, bunnings and the good guys were violating the privacy act by using  facial recognition technology to capture and collect a “faceprint” of customers who entered selected stores. around 76 per cent of consumers were unaware that businesses used video cameras for this purpose. stores using facial recognition technology in this way is similar to “gathering your fingerprints or dna every time you shop”. under the privacy act, biometric data gathered by facial recognition technology is considered sensitive personal data. clearly, existing laws are lacking when it comes to protecting us from potentially harmful facial recognition technology. in these cases, it’s not clear whether the decision to deploy this technology wasn’t run past the legal teams in their respective organisations, whether the legal teams under-estimated the potential public backlash, or if they didn’t have sufficient understanding of the nuances of facial recognition to realise the potential risks – or perhaps some combination of all three. in any case, having tighter involvement with a better informed legal team may have raised concerns earlier or led to these organisations informing their customers in a more transparent way. it is very important to understand and examine how in-house lawyers become involved in procuring, designing, deploying and overseeing the emerging digital technologies in their firms and how they mitigate risks associated with emerging technologies. what is unclear is whether current legal education and training is sufficient for lawyers providing advice on emerging technology. firstly, for many new applications of emerging technology, there may be several areas of existing legislation that apply but most of these were designed without these technological advances in mind. secondly, often no precedent exists for many issues regarding emerging technology. and this puts lawyers in a position of needing to understand the implications of emerging technology and provide legal and ethical advice without clear legislation and precedents. only once lawyers and law students understand the underlying legal and technical frameworks of emerging digital technology and are well-equipped to respond to technology-related issues will they be able to mitigate the legal risks associated with them. the centre for ai and digital ethics (caide) is launching a new project to ensure that lawyers understand the underlying legal and technical frameworks of emerging digital technology. the four-year project new legal thinking for emerging technologies  is funded by the menzies foundation under the ninian stephen law program . the first phase is to understand how lawyers currently address these problems. if you are an in-house lawyer who has given legal or ethical advice on technology, we invite you for a one-hour online interview. please contact dr fahimeh abedi abedi.f@unimelb.edu.au if you are interested and available for an interview before 28 july 2022.

is a semester-long training program for full-time student entrepreneurs the university’s psl center for teaching innovation, created in 2021, supports all psl professors and teaching staff in their educational projects. in this interview, mattias mano, the center’s new director, outlines the center’s strategic missions and looks back on the lessons learned during the pandemic, which has increased the use of digital tools in education as in other sectors.  mattias mano: the main mission of the center for teaching innovation is to support psl professors and education officers in their educational transformation projects. the goal is to enhance and diversify educational practices in order to promote the success of all students. to achieve this goal, we offer two types of services: the first is focused on supporting faculty members. our center is at their service. assistance from the center for teaching innovation involves supporting professors in their reflection on how to continuously improve their teaching. the center’s educational engineers, with their diverse experience and scientific oversight, are able to understand and suggest solutions to teaching problems that professors may encounter. the second is focused on training faculty members. through the in-house psl school, we offer a great number of training programs to raise their understanding of the changes currently taking place in education. this is given particular focus during the welcome week for new professors, a perfect time to promote the center, or during pédagodays, two days of peer-to-peer exchanges to reflect on one’s own teaching practices. the main challenge ahead of us is raising the profile of the center and its services. we need to reach out to all psl schools. the aim is to understand the specific characteristics of their teaching, to compile their needs in relation to the center’s services, and of course, to meet them. this will be achieved by building a community of practice for psl faculty members. far from replacing the role of the teacher, technology is a supplementary tool that can compensate for potential shortcomings, especially in times of crisis. mattias mano: the health crisis we have gone through has put students, most of all, in a situation of great difficulty. too many of them have become very isolated. professors have also shown an unprecedented degree of resilience in ensuring the infamous ‘instructional continuity’. this continuity was made possible largely thanks to digital tools, with videoconferencing in the main. however, for many professors, this forced experimentation with remote learning was very negative. i would like to highlight the strength and courage of the administrative staff (especially in the information systems department and in our center), who made it possible to maintain teaching during an emergency situation.* as the crisis nears its end, which we all hope will be for good, services like the center for teaching innovation cannot ignore the fact that many professors may harbor a desire to do things ‘as befor e’ (the pandemic). overall, the pandemic has advanced us by several years in terms of our understanding of digital tools. its impact is a powerful reminder that, far from replacing the role of the teacher, technology is a supplementary tool that can compensate for potential shortcomings, especially in times of crisis. the center for teaching innovation aims to synthesize this wealth of experience. our goal is to perpetuate the best practices that have emerged from the crisis and to extend their use. * innovation pédagogique, l’enseignement en situation d’urgence en france , july 9, 2020, by perrine de coëtlogon, mattias mano, bertrand mocquet . mattias mano : digital technology is just a tool. we will never push the use of a tool for the sake of it. when a teacher asks us to implement a particular moodle activity or a particular wooclap activity, we seek first and foremost to meet an educational need. for example, using wooclap facilitates the interaction between students and the professor in an auditorium. this tool makes it possible to pause a lecture and ask the students questions, to ensure that they can follow what they are being taught. similarly, almost all classes rely on the use of educational resources. the moodle learning platform is used to centralize and classify these resources. professors have the option to upload all of them when they build their course, and to make them available to students as they go along. this reduces the administrative load of a course and facilitates the learning process. in short, once educational needs have been identified, the center helps the teacher find the best way to meet them. very often, the digital tools at our disposal make it easier to offer a solution.  mattias mano: the simplest way to find out more about our activities and to get in touch is to visit our website. there you will find interviews with professors, useful information, a calendar of the training courses we offer at the psl school, and most importantly, how to contact us for a support request. the pédagodays - psl, which will be held on june 16 and 17 ( registration via the psl school ) are also a great way to find out more about us. on these days we will be offering workshops and discussions with teachers who have worked with us in the past. we also have three branches in three different locations on campus: dauphine – psl, mines paris – psl and observatoire de paris – psl. these are friendly, social places, so don’t hesitate to come and have a coffee!  doctor of management from the institut polytechnique de paris, alumni of the master’s program in data science (formerly quantitative methods and social science) from ensae and the research master’s in economics from the paris school of economics, mattias mano developed the digitization of the ‘executive education’ training offer at the ecole polytechnique as digital learning manager from 2018 to 2022. during his dissertation on collective intelligence in online forums, he also coor dinated the teaching team of the mooc, " how to write and publish a scientific paper ” offered by the ecole polytechnique on the coursera platform, which now has almost 200,000 registrants. he joined université psl in february 2022 as director of the center for educational innovation.  on june 14, 2023, the president of the french republic announced the 125 companies selected for the french tech 2030 call for projects, launched in april. this program brings together the expertise of france 2030, the french tech mission and bpi france, to promote the development of french deeptech start-ups with dedicated support. 50% of selected start-ups come from public research, including 11 from the université psl ecosystem. out of the 125 companies selected for the french tech 2030 program, 11 come from université psl’s research laboratories, incubators, or the energy and motivation of psl graduates. most were supported by the university's research promotion services and/or the psl innovation fund in their first years of development. today, they are recognized and promoted as emerging actors of innovation, responding to challenges to society and sovereignty in three areas: digital technology, environmental transition and health. alice & bob is developing a universal, error-correcting quantum computer, to sell its calculating power. the quantum computer will make it possible to solve certain problems, which are too complex even for today’s supercomputers, exponentially faster. until today, errors (due to decoherence) were the main obstacle to the development of such machines. the schrödinger's cat qubit used by alice & bob, which is the product of research by raphaël lescanne (ens – psl) and zaki leghtas (mines paris – psl), drastically simplifies the challenge by automatically correcting such errors.

transformation. this diploma offering is a new initiative for cfee (campus formation etudiants entreprises). with an emphasis on autonomy and expertise, the goal is to bring students, employees and professionals together in collaborative project teams and to train them.  interview with the managers of the training program: anne lalou , director of web school factory and bruno rostand , director of innovation and entrepreneurship at université psl.  bruno rostand : it is indeed a partnership of a new type, but at psl we are used to creating bridges between disciplines and players…we were contacted by the web school factory to develop a joint response to the pia disrupt campus call for proposals and saw this as an opportunity to further diversify our approaches and discover new perspectives, particularly in the areas of innovation and digital transformation, which are priorities for us. anne lalou : by co-creating this curriculum, we wanted, and this is very new, to get involved in setting up companies and open them to new innovative ecosystems. to meet this challenge, the campus of formation etudiants entreprises is based on three pillars. while taking into account the new skills needed in today's digital world, we wanted to not only implement collaborations between students and employees, but also, create a new project-based training program. cfee will develop the creativity, entrepreneurship and innovation capabilities of our students anne lalou : in companies, innovation is being done more and more by "intrapreneurial" approaches. in practice, this means that an sme or a large group gives some of its employees the time and support necessary for the development of a project that could, potentially, turn into a profitable business. intrapreneurship offers companies the opportunity to think outside the box and open up to the vitality of the entrepreneurial ecosystem... digital transformation and innovation will increasingly go through this type of approach and we wanted to support the framework of cfee by providing students and employees with the necessary tools. bruno rostand : similar to our entrepreneurship trainings ( iti , psl-pépite ), cfee will develop the creativity, entrepreneurship and innovation capacities of our students, but intrapreneurship starts with a concrete challenge to answer the needs of a partner company, and this brings a new dimension: an immersion in the life of the company and an experience of the digital transition which happens there. in this regard cfee completes and enriches our training offer and, moreover, some of the activities of cfee will take place at the psl-lab, coworking space of the psl-pépite entrepreneurship group. anne lalou : there will be many of them. the impact of the cfee student training will be, in my opinion, quite immediate. the web school factory already exists.  student projects give a fresh look at the teams of partner companies. it is a fruitful interaction that moves lines and opens additional interesting perspectives. the students of the cfee will be able to profit from it. this new curriculum is also, in our opinion, an investment of the future. it will complement the training of shs students or psl engineering students by providing them with expertise and experience in digital transformation.   besides the mixing of social origins, internationalization or parity, intergenerational is essential. cfee will be an example. bruno rostand : students have a lot to learn from employees about the reality of a market and business experiences. in return, they bring a fresh look to which the rigor and the level of requirement of their training match. employees will leave their comfort zone, put aside their certainties, to bring out innovative and transformative concepts for their company. anne lalou : we bet that this intergenerational collaboration will be stimulating, constructive and, above all, that it will serve as a founding experience for their lifelong training: to learn in initial training, in continuing education, online or even in groups… these formats will disappear and it is a great opportunity for the players to experience it at this stage. we talk a lot about diversity in today's world. besides the mixing of social origins, internationalization or parity, intergenerational diversity is essential. cfee will be an example. start-ups, i hope, will emerge from this program. and after all, rather than finding a job, why not create it? anne lalou : more than recruitments, i want the cfee curriculum to lead learners to a concrete ambition, offering them a taste for innovation and creativity. start-ups, i hope, will emerge from this program. and after all, rather than finding a job, why not create it? the key is to develop the capacity for transformation and innovation, inside and outside organizations. cfee will be the proof that our companies today are ready to innovate differently, organizations must accept confrontation and understand that student collaboration can result in great new concepts. that's what i want for our students!  anne lalou : dear learners, a unique opportunity awaits you to start a new chapter of your training. seize this opportunity, see yourself as pioneers forging your individual paths and future! create innovation today and tomorrow. do not limit yourself, be ambitious, be resolutely intrapreneurial, because the transformation of our economic landscape also happens with you. bruno rostand : dear students, be a part of the digital revolution alongside our partner companies; rise to the challenge, and collaborate with a diverse multicultural and intergenerational team! dear employees of our business partners, come share your experiences and ambitions with our students in order to co-create the solutions of tomorrow!  the digital transformation is ushering in a host of new business practices. in september, to help today’s managers, decision-makers, entrepreneurs and employees draw on those latest practices to enhance their capacity for innovation, creativity and autonomy, psl and the web school factory introduced the new cfee program (campus formation etudiants entreprises), a 10-month interdisciplinary course in intrapreneurship. we talked to the program’s instructional and project directors about this unusual new course offering. françois pumir : half of this year’s cfee class are students from psl and the web school factory, while the other half are professionals from our partner businesses. the primary benefit of this training is that it gives the participants a new perspective and a set of methodologies for managing the digital transformation, which is exactly what those participants have been hoping to find. one of the essential ways we’re effecting the digital transformation is by putting people at the heart of every project. we encourage our students to adopt a user-centric approach and to tackle every issue in terms of what’s desirable rather than the more restrictive mindset – still so common in the business world – of what’s feasible. at this stage, everyone’s still very motivated, although the change in viewpoint has been a little disconcerting for some in the group. thibaut barbarin : the students and professionals in our class come from a wide array of backgrounds. they’re engineers, attorneys, managers, and so on. and within their work groups they may each take a similar approach, or they may clash. that’s proven very fertile; we can already see that the learning process will be much faster than in other programs.  launch of a course dedicated to intrapreneurship and digital transformation f.p. : right at the start of the semester, we held the cfee hack to serve as a real-world exercise. the class had six days to come up with new business models for some very established industries. it’s a difficult test, regardless of your age or experience, because you can’t simply fall back on an automatic response. the goal of the exercise is to give students the ability to sit down in front a corporate board or a group of lenders and offer a vision of a given topic that’s not just business-minded but user-centric, concrete and objective. the instructional team (professors, our partner business leaders, etc.) helped guide them through that first experience. it’s a shift in perspective that can be disconcerting, but it’s necessary in order to embrace the radically new vision of what the digital transformation can be. t.b. : the cfee hack was a really enlightening experience for everyone in the class about the need to learn more. ever since, they’ve been much more aware of the learning curve, they’re investing the time and they’re using that learning time more effectively.  that was also a very good learning experience for handling data. the digital transforma tion involves massive amounts of data, and in my view it’s pretty critical for every professional to get up to speed on those issues. f.p. : project-based instruction has been around since well before the cfee, but we’re changing the format and especially the objective, because our instructional approach involves lecturers (entrepreneurs/professors/experts), students, businesses and their employees all at once. the digital transformation projects we’re tackling aren’t just fictional case studies that illustrate some pedagogical point; they’re actual company projects, whose progress and results are discussed by each company’s executive committee. so there are serious issues at stake! the goal and the ambition we’ve set is to create spin-offs or business units, and employees are at the heart of that process of learning how to generate value. t.b. : when project-based instruction is used in conventional academic curricula, it often uses the pedagogical objective as the starting point, and the case studies they use may be real, but decades old. with the cfee, we’ve chosen to take a different approach: we start with what the company hopes to achieve and we join forces to provide the deliverables. f.p. : a very close relationship. as we said before, the cfee program is distinctive in that its work groups include students, practitioners, educators – there’s no disinterested support. everyone has a stake in the project’s success. that approach applies to the relationship with each company as well. companies get an update on their project’s progress every two weeks, and it’s not uncommon for the cfee teams to meet with the company’s executives and high-level managers over lunch to work on their projects. f.p. : for me, it’s someone who has a real desire to be an entrepreneur and the necessary determination to eliminate obstacles and find solutions. t.b. : someone who’s looking for something different. whether they’d like a more meaningful experience like so many people these days, or they’re simply interested in creating a start-up, it’s that sense of change that’s really important. my feeling is that management is becoming more horizontal these days, and an entrepreneurial mindset will be a key asset. f.p.: again, it’s not a typical learning experience, and above all we’re looking for people who can all be part of a single team. the oral interview will play a much bigger role in whether you’re accepted than your cv or cover letter. f.p. : they’ll be people who can strike the right balance within their organizations, whether they’re entrepreneurs, intrapreneurs or something else – the important thing is that they know how to make a commitment and prosper. fulfilling individual career goals is not what the cfee program is about. t.b. : they’ll be able to take responsibility for the decisions they make, and influence the people around them to help bring about change. this training really promises an exciting personal adventure. fruit de la collaboration ent re the psl university, the innovation factory

master in quantitative economics is a two-year graduate program oriented towards research and advanced quantitative methodsin economics .  entirely taught in english, it seeks to train top-notch economists who are open and reactive to the many questions and challenges facing contemporary economics. at the same time, graduates will have mastered the quantitative tools to address such challenges in terms of data, especially in light of changes brought by big data to the world of public and private decision-makers. after acquiring the fundamental economic concepts in the first year, you will then specialize in a specific economic field through one of the two master 2 tracks: the quantitative economic analysis track provides training in economic research, while the digital economics track is focused on professional training. in addition to quantitative methods, the curriculum also features instruction on massive database processing, as well as the use of computer programming to solve complex economic issues. the master in quantitative economics offers a high-level education enabling graduates to apply to a phd program, as a professional economist in public or semi-public institutions including international organizations (federal departments, economics research institutes, central banks, etc.), or in the private sector (as data analyst, consultant, economic analyst, etc.), in france or abroad. this master's degree is part of psl's graduate program in economics. acquire training in economic research and reflect on the public and private stakeholders’ decision-making procedures learn about quantitative methods for processing massive databases, and about how advanced computer programming can solve complex economic issues address the economic problems facing various sectors of the economy: health, public policies, macroeconomics, finance, energy and environment, development, … make use of statistical and econometric tools to

salesforce “state of the connected customer” report highlighted how 66% of consumers . to do that, enterprises are undergoing digital transformations. identifying the need for a digital transformation is the first step. the second is understanding what an achievable digital transformation strategy must include, the benefits it provides, and how to execute digital innovation across your organization. digital transformation is . organizational leaders are leveraging technological tools to create more streamlined and efficient processes, resulting in a better customer or user experience (ux). your digital business transformation strategy is the detailed plan that outlines how your organization will use technology to establish or enhance processes, culture, and the experiences customers have with your brand. if digital transformation means modifying or adopting new technology to drive innovation across all departments, then your digital transformation framework is the blueprint your organization uses to achieve this. imagine your digital transformation strategy as a detailed map that guides your business through a successful evolution. there are five key focus areas where businesses can leverage digital transformation to create more connected and cohesive experiences. they include: product or service offerings assets processes decision-making organizational structure additionally, there are four types of digital transformation that your organization may pursue: this type of digital transformation focuses on using analytics, kpis, machine learning, artificial intelligence, and other tools to improve internal processes and operations. ultimately, corporations use process transformation to identify areas where procedures could improve and leverage digital solutions to make said processes more streamlined and cohesive, resulting in operational efficiency. through business model transformation, leadership teams have the power to modify traditional enterprise structures and improve efficiency. this type of digital transformation can be cumbersome, as it involves redefining the foundational building blocks of how a business operates and delivers its products or services. however, the result is a business model that adapts to and produces what consumers are looking to attain. domain transformation modifies how a company’s website is structured. this type of digital transformation is critical for the e-commerce sector, as it can completely redefine how users interact and do business with a brand. successful digital transformation requires the cooperation of an entire organization. by leveraging organizational transformation, leadership teams ensure internal teams are learning technical skills and applying those skills to everyday tasks. ideally, organizational transformation leads to more flexible workflows, a greater need for continuous data measurement, and a cohesive business ecosystem where all members are aligned in achieving the same goals. you r business transformation strategy will seek to enhance how your organization operates. empowers your organization to optimize performance, boost customer retention and engagement, and advance growth. meanwhile, enterprises without digital transformation strategies will have difficulty developing new capabilities to modernize their business models and ensure enjoyable consumer experiences. more specifically, digital transformation will allow your business to: digital transformation allows your organization to gather customer feedback and incorporate those insights into its business strategy. in doing so, you create a customer-centric approach that can provide consumers with more personalized messaging and, ultimately, better experiences. commercenext’s report found that 2020 saw a 10% increase (39% to 49%) in businesses prioritizing personalization tactics to improve customer retention. through digital transformation, your enterprise can quickly collect real-time data and convert those metrics into valuable insights. then, you can use these data-driven insights to form the foundation of business and marketing strategies. a key benefit of digital transformation is its ability to consolidate resources, assets, and tech tools. by creating a central depository, you have better visibility over processes. this allows you to visualize workflows, identify areas of improvement, and efficiently allocate resources like labor and budgeting. with the right processes and tools in place, your team can implement more structured workflows, automate wherever possible, integrate data into existing campaigns, and build an agile enterprise. these elements work together to create cohesive operations that drive new sales. when , there are three essential forces that drive the strategy: adopting a digital-first mindset creating a digitally literate culture using data to ensure continuous evolvement first things first, your digital transformation journey will require every member of the organization to adopt a digital-first mindset. while the world has been progressively becoming more digitally savvy, the in-person barriers due to covid-19 have accelerated the need for efficient technology. from scheduling doctor visits to ordering takeout delivery, digital tools have weaved their way into every area of our lives. therefore, businesses need to be ready and willing to adopt these new technologies to meet consumer demand. but a digital-first mindset alone isn’t enough to power a successful digital transformation — you also need to become digitally literate. your business must be adopting new technology and ensuring that they are being used as efficiently as possible. therefore, the second driving factor of implementing a digital transformation strategy is enforcing effective onboarding and training sessions to create a digitally literate team. finally, the third driving force of digital transformation is continuous evolvement. through consistent research and data collectio n, businesses can use valuable insights to identify and drive enhancements. these enhancements may be internal, such as refining repetitive tasks that put additional stress on team members, or external, like improving website flow to create a better customer experience. by leveraging data, businesses will continue to make essential improvements that allow them to maintain a competitive advantage within the marketplace. to , you need to: determine what type of digital transformation approach your

that work. ooops. looks like you have javascript turned off! this means you can't see the form on this page you can use to . if you asked dr. pamela hinds, the fortinet founders chair and professor of management science & engineering at stanford and co-director of the center on work, technology, and organization, she would say that’s a good start. understanding the technologies that underpin digital transformation is necessary but not sufficient. radically remaking an organization's products, services, and business models requires not just understanding technology, but also cultural change. as dr. hinds explains in the webinar, , most traditional organizations simply cannot cope with the pace of innovation happening now. they were built for reliability, not for speed. a growing body of evidence shows organizations that manage to transform themselves also undergo significant cultural change from root to tip. what does that cultural change look like? in the webinar, dr. hinds outlines five essential shifts organizations must make to succeed at digital transformation. the first and most essential shift is towards a more customer centric culture. digital transformation doesn’t happen for its own sake. it happens to serve customers better and drive the business forward. if you don’t understand your customers’ unmet needs, the other aspects of your digital transformation won’t be focused on the right goals. you can have cutting-edge technology and processes, but they won’t move your business forward if they don’t ultimately help you delight your customers. once you understand where you’re trying to get to with your digital transformation, it’s key to move quickly in that direction. but the path of digital transformation is rarely if ever a straight line. the pace of change requires organizations to pivot regularly. you need to be both fast and nimble. that kind of agility often requires rethinking organizational structures. traditional hierarchical structures like multi-layer decision making and lengthy approval processes can get in the way of the ability to take advantage of opportunities rapidly. building for the future requires targeted demolition of out-dated structures. essential checks must, of course, remain, but successful digital transformation requires clearing obstacles to quick experimentation and implementation. traditionally, when organizations wanted to innovate or update their offerings, they would go out and hire someone with the right kind of expertise to drive that change. but when it comes to today’s digital transformation, experts don’t exist. change is happening so fast that even the most qualified and experienced employees must  constantly update their knowledge. that is why it is so important to build a culture of curiosity and voracious learning if an organization is aiming for digital transformation. “  in order to drive new knowledge creation, you need to have people not just willing to, but passionate about, going and learning new things and thinking in new ways,” dr. hinds explains in the webinar. the best, most ground-breaking ideas are often born out of unusual combinations of expertise or technology. traditional org charts can silo in knowledge, making that kind of fruitful cross-pollination less likely. a culture of unbounded collaboration, on the other hand, allows or even incentivizes employees to work across traditional boundaries, for instance in cross-functional groups. sometimes it even means working outside of the organization when you need to access expertise that doesn't exist within the organization itself. historically, this kind of interdisciplinary work was handled asynchronously. one team would work on their portion of a project before handing it off to another team. that iterative process is just not fast enough anymore. for digital transformation to succeed a culture of unbounded collaboration is essential. trying lots of new and out-of-the box ideas is essential to learn what works and what doesn’t in the uncertain and fast-moving process of digital transformation. but employees are unwilling to try new things if they believe they will be laughed at or even punished if their ideas fail. organizations must explicitly incentivize risk taking and even failure. by this hinds doesn’t mean . when we know how to do something right and just get sloppy, that’s a preventable failure that should be discouraged. but organizations should encourage the other kind of failure discussed by edmonsdon – intelligent failures at the frontier. these are failures that provide new knowledge. they’re learning opportunities. for digital transformation to succeed, an organization’s culture must embrace this second sort of failure. the bottom line for dr. hinds — and for those both leading and participating in digital transformation — is that success is as much about the right culture as it is about the right technology. “digital transformation requires rethinking organizations, cultures, structures, and systems, and the way that people think about their work and work together,” she believes. these changes aren’t just for industries that we usually think of as hi-tech, nor are they just the preserve of top executives.   ”even industries that are typically thought about as being low-tech will be and are experiencing radical changes,” dr. hinds says, recalling a recent trip to a dairy farm where the cows were milked automatically and output was monitored remotely via ipad. “it's important to be ready,” she concludes. “[digital transformation] is pervasive and it is always better to be in the know and be able to anticipate some of these things so that we can get ahead of the m and make a contribution.”

ai25 is striving to develop and test digital solutions for the factory of the future and implement them in vehicle production and logistics for series production within the next five years, with the overarching goal of making these key components of the production process even more efficient and flexible. particularly beneficial will be neckarsulm’s expertise in small-series and volume production. “we already have extensive experience in the areas of vehicle production, logistics and production it at our neckarsulm site. we will further enhance these capabilities in a targeted manner as part of the transformation. with our dedicated team of experts and our partners in the automotive initiative 2025 we develop the site into a leading factory for digital production and logistics within the group,” said peter kössler, board member for production and logistics at audi. as part of the bildungscampus heilbronn and the heilbronn-franken region’s innovation and it network, the site will help to develop such future thinking solutions as the use of artificial intelligence or intuitive man-machine interaction. xl2, the heilbronn-based joint venture founded last year by audi and capgemini, will play an important role when it comes to bringing it innovations to the audi plants around the world. with academic support from the fraunhofer iao and the technical university of munich, xl2 will collaborate with additional it experts from capgemini, sap and aws to develop the it solutions required for a smart and connected factory. the basis for this collaboration is the digital production platform (dpp), in which the data of every machine, piece of equipment and system from every plant in the volkswagen group are pooled. the sites thus become part of the industrial cloud, which in the future will also include the group’s supply chain as well as additional partners. with neckarsulm and ingolstadt, the first two audi sites have already been connected to the dpp; the remaining sites will follow later this year. in their collaboration, the companies will be leveraging aws technologies in the areas of the internet of things (iot), machine learning and computing services that will be developed specifically for the production environment and adapted to the requirements of the automotive industry. furthermore, the use of the sap s/4hana platform will lay the foundation for the next generation of digital production processes, on which the companies will work together on solutions for modular production and interoperable vehicle logistics. as part of this interdisciplinary collaboration between research, industry and it, the companies will use industry-specific applications of the sap industry cloud in the areas of machine learning, robotic process automation and business process intelligence, which are holistically aligned with future needs for the automation and digitalization of the automotive industry. “with the automotive initiative 2025, we have created a pioneering, in terdisciplinary network between academia, research, it companies and automobile manufacturing. the initiative uses sound science to drive the digital transformation of automobile production within the overall context of technology, organization and particularly continuing education,” explains professor helmut krcmar from the technical university of munich. “ai25 is characterized by its holistic view of the digital transformation and by its clear ties to the real world. we study both strategic topics and concrete use cases that accelerate the digital transformation and generate new innovative ideas,” added frank loydl, chief information officer (cio) at audi ag. the initiative is also expected to become an idea foundry and driver for the digital transformation of production and logistics throughout the volkswagen group. the knowledge gleaned will be used to help shape the future it configuration of the automotive plants and expand this sustainably at audi. other goals include the definition of generally applicable standards for the transformation and the rollout of concrete use cases to all group plants worldwide via the industrial cloud. ai25 is striving to develop and test digital solutions for the factory of the future and implement them in vehicle production and logistics for series production within the next

year by audi and capgemini, will play an important role when it comes to bringing it innovations to the audi plants around the world. with academic support from the fraunhofer iao and the technical university of munich, xl2 will collaborate with additional it experts from capgemini, sap and aws to develop the it solutions required for a smart and connected factory. the basis for this collaboration is the digital production platform (dpp), in which the data of every machine, piece of equipment and system from every plant in the volkswagen group are pooled. the sites thus become part of the industrial cloud, which in the future will also include the group’s supply chai n as well as additional partners. with neckarsulm and ingolstadt, the first two audi sites have already been connected to the dpp; the remaining sites will follow later this year. in their collaboration, the companies will be leveraging aws technologies in the areas of the internet of things (iot), machine learning and computing services that will be developed specifically for the production environment and adapted to the requirements of the automotive industry. furthermore, the use of the sap s/4hana platform will lay the foundation for the next generation of digital production processes, on which the companies will work together on solutions for modular production and interoperable vehicle logistics. as part of this interdisciplinary collaboration between research, industry and it, the companies will use industry-specific applications of the sap industry cloud in the areas of machine learning, robotic process automation and business process intelligence, which are holistically aligned with future needs for the automation and digitalization of the automotive industry. “with the automotive initiative 2025, we have created a pioneering, interdisciplinary network between academia, research, it companies and automobile manufacturing. the initiative uses sound science to drive the digital transformation of automobile production within the overall context of technology, organization and particularly continuing education,” explains professor helmut krcmar from the technical university of munich. “ai25 is characterized by its holistic view of the digital transformation and by its clear ties to the real world. we study both strategic topics and concrete use cases that accelerate the digital transformation and generate new innovative ideas,” added frank loydl, chief information officer (cio) at audi ag. the initiative is also expected to become an idea foundry and driver for the digital transformation of production and logistics throughout the volkswagen group. the knowledge gleaned will be used to help shape the future it configuration of the automotive plants and expand this sustainably at audi. other goals include the definition of generally applicable standards for the transformation and the rollout of concrete use cases to all group plants worldwide via the industrial cloud. the study shows: nearly two thirds (62%) of the companies do not yet have a digital transformation strategy. more than half of them also have no plans to strategically address the issue in the future. even among the strategically well-positioned enterprises, around half see digitalization only as a one-off project and not as an ongoing process. the bigger the company, the more likely it is to have a concept in place. but even among those with more than 250 employees, nearly one third have no strategy. most companies taking a strategic approach to digitalization are doing so with the goal of reducing costs, for example by automating processes. only one in four is trying to use digital technologies to develop innovations, adopt new business models or gain access to further markets. however, one third of the companies with a strategic outlook plan to pursue such objectives in order to increase sales in the coming years. consequently, the mittelstand companies are mostly using established technologies that offer immediate benefits, such as cloud computing and connectivity. only one quarter of those surveyed regard artificial intelligence (ai) as important for their own operations and just 2 percent are using it. “the pragmatism of many mittelstand firms is certainly justified,” says jens förderer , professor of innovation and digitalization at the tum campus heilbronn. “digitalization does not offer equally large benefits regardless of when and where it is implemented. but it is a mistake to treat it as a new automation wave and focus on a few adjustments with a short-term impact. it involves a fundamental transformation of business models and markets affecting companies of all sizes. without clear objectives and good planning, companies risk a loss of competitiveness.” the companies without strategies listed specific problems preventing them from taking action. around 50% mentioned an inadequate digital infrastructure and 40% the unavailability of skilled personnel. one-third cited excessive bureaucracy and a lack of skills in their own workforce. the companies already managing the digital transformation present a similar picture: more than half of them cited skills shortages, bureaucracy and poor infrastructure as the key impediments. “it is alarming to note that barriers over which companies have no control play a much bigger role than internal factors. this further discourages laggards from actively tackling the digital transformation,” says dr. christoph geier, director digital transformation at the tum campus heilbronn. “policy makers, public administration and associations need to create the conditions so that even small companies can make a successful transformation. this will be essential for retaining global market leaders and hidden champions in the region.” the research team also asked the smes to state who is responsible for the digital transformation within the company and which partners they wanted to work with. in more than 70% of the  respondent companies, the top management was directly responsible for the operational implementation. very few smes are cooperating with other companies. just 13% are using cloud platforms, 10% strategic sales partners and 7% online marketplaces. only about one third of the companies see it as important to draw on external expertise, for example through consultancies or universities. “managing digitalization from the boss’s desk – it sounds good in principle,” says michaela lindenmayr, a researcher at the professorship for innovation and digitalization. “the top management must ensure a strategic approach to the digital transformation. in some cases, however, it is fair to ask whether senior executives can invest enough time and whether the company is making good use of the skills in the functional units. the specialized knowledge and skills of possible partners also harbor enormous potential that companies should not do without.” the study shows: nearly two thirds (62%) of the companies do not yet have a digital transformation strategy. more than half of them also have no plans to strategically address the

hundreds of colleagues, we are able to go ahead with the three significant activities designed to evolve oxford’s digital landscape:  the was approved by university council last term. they have agreed a budget of £16.6 million for the year 23-24 with placeholders for future years. you can get a detailed picture of the progress we have made in the foundation phase and the transformational initiatives we’re planning to deliver in phase 2: .  oxford’s new has been agreed by the university council. these governance changes will start being introduced from this term (mt23) and are being described by many colleagues as being a ‘truly transformational’ change in the way we think about, govern, and deliver digital change across the university. you can .  the recommendations have been delivered, you can . working with colleagues across the collegiate university, the review has, over the last nine months, diagnosed the issues we face with the delivery of it infrastructure services across the university. the recommendations centre around the realisation of a new service delivery model for the university’s it infrastructure service whereby component services are designed so they are ‘shared by default and bespoke by exception’. our next step is to appoint a programme manager and, working closely with divisions, agree an implementation plan by the end of mt23. this plan will include a programme of change activities so we can start implementing the recommended changes to realise the potential of our service, provide greater value for departments and improve user experience. my thanks to hundreds of colleagues and students for their ideas, insights, and feedback during the last few months. our large-scale engagement activities for all three of these programmes have been tremendous and have acted as a beacon of what we can achieve with university-wide effort. as we are planning our activities for this year, we are now better equipped with new insights about oxford’s richness, breadth, and depth that will, in some areas, result in breakthrough changes in our capability. thank you.  a significant aim of the foundations phase was to create the conditions for success – to understand and put in place the changes required to ensure the investments made through this programme will have a sustained and continuing impact. we believe we have achieved that through our investigative work, interventions, competency centres, governance review, and it infrastructure service review. i hope you will join us for oxford’s first digital festival on thursday 9 november 2023 at the jesus college digital hub. we will be celebrating oxford’s digital transformation, sharing insights, and exploring new possibilities together. the registration site will open next week. in the meantime, we’d love your ideas on what you’d like to experience  at the festival and stories about how you and your colleagues are innovating in your part of oxford. please . and do tell your colleagues about the festival. i look forward to sharing regular news about our work and how you can get involved with oxford’s digital transformation during the next few months. if you haven’t already, please our new newsletter about oxford’s digital transformation (first edition next week). thank you for continuing to play your part in oxford’s digital transformation. with best wishes, anne contact the digital transformation team at:  we will enable oxford to continue advancing learning by teaching and research, and preserve its unique place in the world by being digitally fit for

planet. over the next few years, we will partner with leaders and their teams across the collegiate university alongside external experts to introduce appropriately paced and carefully coordinated changes that meet both central and local needs. digital transformation is not just about updating it systems and introducing some new apps. a true digital transformation will take years and will depend on a cultural shift across the entire collegiate oxford. it will create opportunities for all of us to reimagine how we do things and how we work with each other. dear colleague, i am writing about a change of leadership for the digital transformation programme. has decided to step away from his role as programme director of oxford’s digital transformation. stuart has been my ‘co-pilot’ for the last two years, having previously supported sean duffy, cio, in the development of the itransform initiative on which we have built digital transformation. i am extremely grateful for stuart’s expertise, acumen, and counsel during the development of the complex bids and cases for support and his ability to work with colleagues to understand the priorities and aspirations across the institution. stuart will return to his full-time post as deputy cio and head of the office of the cio. although stepping away, stuart continues to be a key individual in the digital transformation programme and will be designing, developing, and helping to deliver key elements of our new governance and delivery model. i’d like to say a huge thanks to stuart for his contributions to date and look forward to continuing to work closely with him. i’m delighted to announce that is joining us as our new programme director. natasha is just finishing her role as the director of strategic programmes and bi at saïd business school. in this role, she has been leading user experience, change management, programme management, and all things data. natasha’s career spans 27 years in it, ranging from infrastructure support to digital transformation in both commercial and higher education, including at elsevier where she worked with global teams to move the company from publishing to global information analytics. at the business school, natasha ran a salesforce transformation, establishing a new compliant data architecture, streamlining processes, and putting the customer/student/client at the heart of everything. natasha tells me she is very much looking forward to blending her intuitive drive for discovery and her hard work ethic to lead oxford’s digital transformation.  i’m sure you’ll join me in congratulating natasha on her new appointment. with best wishes, professor anne trefethen, pro-vice-chancellor (people & digital) email the digital transformation programme at oxford’s digital transformation is led by professor anne trefethen, pro-vice-chancellor for people and digital. you can read more about anne here, and take time to listen to anne’s new podcast ‘digital oxford’. natasha heaton has recently joined digital transformation as the programme director. natasha’s career spans 27 years in it, ranging from infrastructure support to digital transformation in both commercial and higher education, including at elsevier where she worked with global teams to move the company from publishing to global information analytics. she was part of a digital transformation moving from waterfall delivery to agile, specifically squads using scrum. natasha moved across roles in product, it, programme management and change management. she then joined the business school and delivered a customer centric transformation, creating a new data architecture supported by a change programme to simplify and automate manual processes across the customer journey. the programme team has recently been realigned for success of phase 2 of the digital transformation and now spans three distinct areas: programme delivery, change management, and communications: programme delivery is led by cathy farrow and ensures that we organise and execute our activities effectively across the programme. this involves planning, quality, budgeting, and reporting. current activities include setting up our expertise hub to support the portfolios and delivery teams in new ways of working, planning and supporting pilots, and providing guidance where required to new investigative work and interventions under phase 2. change management for digital transformation is led by heidi hunt and covers all aspects of the people side of change. this includes areas such as planning and delivering the training we need to build new capabilities, ensuring we introduce changes in planned and structured ways that minimise disruption and supporting colleagues during the changes through engagement and involvement. heidi’s current focus is working on supporting the new governance committees as they progress through the financial year, introducing new reporting capabilities as well as introducing new processes for approvals. the change team will also be supporting the education pilot teams as they trial the new agile-based delivery approach, bringing together project and service teams to deliver continuous improvements in an agile way. communications is led by ejaz khan, and he is supported by talietha willett. this programme communications team ensures that all staff - academics, researchers, professional, technical and support staff - in divisions, departments, colleges, and professional services - students, and other stakeholders can feel informed, engaged, and inspired by oxford’s digital transformation. the scope of the communications team includes: overall programme communications (e.g. website, digital oxford podcast, ‘on tour’ sessions, digital digest newsletter, asset bank, e xplainers, events such as the digital festival) change communications to support transformational initiatives (phase 2, competency centres, capabilities, and communication advice / review / approve service for colleagues involved with interventions and investigative assignments. change communications to support digital governance and operating model (change engagement campaigns with change champions, digital hub governance spo site, ask the digital team / drop-ins / clinics (coming soon) and communication plans to support the introduction of the new digital governance unit (dgu). plus supporting communication for the innovation-focused digital tribe community. change communications to support shared infrastructure services (e.g. website, faqs, resources, and division-by-division communications). change communications to support continuous transformation (foundations campaigns: data, identity, ux, people, environment, moving to portfolio-based continuous transformation and being agile). the extended digital transformation programme team includes: a key part of oxford’s digital transformation is the introduction of new competency centres. alwyn collinson is head of the competency centres.  you can work with each competency centre team to ask for expert support in a key area of digital technology. the current competency centres support cybersecurity, research cloud computing, and workflow automation. new centres being introduced in 2024 include immersive technologies and ai and ml support. each competency centre can share expertise in new digital solutions through training, advice, and support for oxford’s people: academics, researches professional services staff, and relevant students. each centre is made up of a small group of dedicated staff who will support you in growing your confidence and competence as the university moves though its digital transformation. they provide free training, free consultancy, and help your team to deploy new technologies. you can read more about oxford’s competency centres . the programme manager for the shared infrastructure services programme is brendan donnelly. the programme will be delivering on the work of the it infrastructure services review and will facilitate a more connected and collaborative it infrastructure across the university. work has begun to consult with colleagues across the divisions to determine priorities for this academic year based on the initiatives from the service review. the programme will look to define what a shared service is then find, and create, those services and support them with members across the divisions. further communications will follow during the next few weeks and months. the data programme manager is alex gray. this programme will implement the new data strategy which aims to improve data governance through improved processes and technology; and make that data more easily available through improved bi reporting, signposting to reports and access to data via integration s. these improvements support other digital transformation and it projects; university strategic initiatives such as professional service reviews and value for money review; and reduce burden on staff.   we asked professor sir nigel shadbolt for his views on oxford and ai. nigel is principal of jesus college, professorial research fellow and head of human centred computing in computer science, university of oxford.   email   (sso required) the new framework will create greater alignment to university priorities, simplify and speed up decision making, and put more emphasis on user-focused digital experiences. it will also provide a clearer view across the institution of what digital services are available to staff and students and at what cost. as part of the foundation phase of oxford university’s digital transformation programme, we identified that one of the most important success criteria for a sustained and real impact of any digital changes is the governance and delivery of digital services and infrastructure. accordingly, a working group was set up to consider the existing it governance and options for the future. following its review, the group has made recommendations on digital governance (how we decide what to do), operations (how we do it), and on organisational structures (how we structure the organisation to operate effectively). the review found that the way the university governs it is too narrowly focused on just the it part and not the ‘business part.’ the proposed governance framework shifts the focus from it (technology) to governance embedded more in the university mission and “business” and extends the scope to include data, information, and cybersecurity. the review of our existing it governance approach found several themes, including: silos – there are too many committees operating in silos. siloed and slower decision making – project-based funding not effectively tensioned against other needs. not sufficiently tied into university priorities – the committees lack integration with “business”, in terms of strategic input and alignment with strategic need, prioritisation and implementation. current it board model is not working appropriately – portfolio scrutiny group key decision making body. not enough user-focus - user design not embedded in projects sufficiently early insufficient engagement with divisional structures not enough focus on data - data governance is floating in our governance - touched on in various committees – focused on in none. complexity - the joint subcommittees model does not interact effectively with other university committees to ensure strategy/priorities driven by business need. it committee is not properly plugged into our governance in general. does not lead to process simplification – doesn’t enable a service improvement model not enough focus on cybersecurity - prioritisation of cybersecurity investments is not properly overseen or considered (it is considered by jisag which reports into security subcommittee, but we need clearer focus on cybersecurity services). lack of continuity and consistency - staff engaged in project delivery may be moved to deliver in other areas without the knowledge of the associated subcommittee.  over time, the portfolio committees will oversee the delivery of services through service streams with responsible owners for the management of the service streams, and service stream delivery teams who wil l maintain and improve the services. in time for mt23: a new information and digital committee (idc) will replace the existing it committee. the idc will be responsible for strategy and policy related to digital services and infrastructure, data, information, and cybersecurity. five portfolio committees will be created that report to idc. they are responsible for services in the areas of education, research, engagement and dissemination, administration and technology. the new committee structure will be put in place to begin from mt23. a portfolio has two modes: governance and delivery  this mode includes overseeing, approving, monitoring, governing, tracking, deciding and guiding projects, services, and spend. all portfolios will transition to the new governance model from mt23.  a new way of delivering projects and services by bringing resources (teams) together into delivery groups for the particular portfolio. over time, this will help to deepen the expertise and knowledge of colleagues working within a particular portfolio.   the new operating model will be piloted with the education portfolio in mt23. the other portfolio committees will focus only on governance and not delivery at this this time. this will require identifying the portfolio support, and service stream owners and providing guidance, training, and support as we work through the implementation of the new model. at the same time key assets will need to be created that will be required by the committees and teams. a review of the pilot will be completed in trinity term 2024 which will inform the further development of the remaining portfolios. the new digital governance framework provides a clearer view across the institution of what digital services are available to staff and students and at what cost. at present this information is not available and sits in many budget lines across the institution. the aim of the proposed changes to governance and the operating model are to shift the delivery of services to be more closely aligned with the business strategy and user needs. the change to the funding and delivery model has been made to allow a more agile and continuous improvement approach and to move away from our existing project-driven way of working. the model is based on service stream delivery teams, which will allow us to build experienced teams knowledgeable in both the business need and digital capabilities. most importantly this aims to reduce siloed decision-making process, whilst at the same time increasing the capability to prioritise spend effectively. the digital transformation programme team will continue to exist and will support delivery of the programme during this transition period. a dedicated change management team will oversee the setting up of the portfolios, the creation of the assets to support the portfolios, providing the training and support for the committees, assisting in provision of training for service stream owners, and in the specific case of t he education portfolio supporting the service stream delivery teams as well. the change management team will also be responsible for the delivery, in due course of the changes recommended by the it infrastructure service review. we recognise that there will be a significant period of transition to bed in the new governance, project and service delivery, identifying and responding to skill gaps, and potentially implementing organisational change to support service and new governance delivery. the full implementation of the governance framework and operating model is expected to take at least 12 months and possibly as long as 24 months. this may appear to be a slow transition, but the suggested timing takes into account the potential organisational/operational changes that will be the outcome of the it infrastructure service review and the continuing series of activities within the digital transformation programme. the implementation of the new governance framework and operating model are transformative in how we envisage digital services and infrastructure and how they are integrated into planning and embedded to ensure the institution is digitally “fit for the future”. once this transition is complete, which may take up to two years, the digital transformation programme becomes business as usual, and the programme team can be disbanded. if you

Based on data collected at the University of Cundinamarca through the
instrument IT4+_TOOL2_RupturasEstrategicas.xslx, an evaluation is carried out
exhaustive assessment of the level of maturity of Information Technology (IT) Management in
the institution. The interpretation of the results focuses on the identification of
critical elements that should be the focus of attention for the Systems Management and
Technology. This analysis covers the six domains of the Reference Framework of
Enterprise Architecture (MRAE): IT strategy, IT governance, information, information systems
information, technological services and use and appropriation.
With the purpose of strengthening the formulation of the IT strategy, we proceeded to identify
strategic ruptures, representing those aspects that constitute
paradigms or gaps to carry out the transformation of IT management in the
University of Cundinamarca and achieve impactful results in the development of
Your activities.
The rating scale, which ranges from 0 to 6, assigns a value of 0 for the category of "NO
APPLIES", 1 for a very low application and 6 for a total application of the item. The
weighting of the questions, with results from 0 to 3, served as a guide to identify
strategic ruptures. In the analysis of each item with a low rating,
They consider aspects that can be improved in future years; also I know
propose possible areas that can be the subject of study, evaluation and direction
from the IT Governance level of the University of Cundinamarca. It should be noted
that these recommendations are presented as opportunities for improvement and not as
obligations.

Abstract
Factors that influence Digital Transformation in higher education institutions.
Universidad Nacional de Colombia, Bogotá Headquarters
Digital transformation enables organizations to stay and compete in the marketplace
through organizational change. In the case of Higher Education Institutions, especially the
factors that may influence a digital transformation process in these institutions have not
been identified. The present research aims to identify these factors, under the Mingers
multimethodology, the Yin case study and the Delphi method.
The Research was developed in 3 stages, namely: the first stage corresponded to the
systematic review of the literature on the digital transformation process focused on the
factors that influence this process and its characterization. In the second stage, the
evaluation of the factors identified in the literature review by experts was carried out
under the Delphi method, applied to a Higher Education Institution, taking the National
University of Colombia Headquarters Bogotá as a case study. In the third stage, the
factors agreed upon by the participating experts were consolidated. The identification of
these factors will serve as input to initiate a process of digital transformation in Institutions
of Higher Education.

Introduction
In recent years, organizations from different sectors have carried out a series of
initiatives to explore new digital technologies and harness their benefits (Matt et
al., 2015 & Amorim & Melao, 2018), with the aim of facing competition in the midst
of a globalized world (Amorim & Melao, 2018). These initiatives have involved
transformations, mainly, in the commercial area, affecting products and processes,
as well as organizational and management structures, this is known as transformation
digital (Matt et al., 2015).
This has become an important part of human life and necessary in almost
all companies seeking growth, expansion, quality and sustainability
(Amorim & Melao, 2018). The above, because the digital transformation processes
make it possible to improve organizational performance, operational efficiency,
customer experiences and the combination of digital and physical businesses (Amorim &
Melao, 2018). Among the benefits achieved by digital transformation are: 1)
increase customer satisfaction, 2) increase customer experience, 3)
improve productivity, 4) increase income from products and services, and 5) the
cost reduction.
Taking the above into account, digital transformation has been associated with greater
frequently to business organizations, however, it is also an issue that concerns
to Higher Education Institutions (IES) (Rodrigues, 2017 & EDUCASE, 2018).
The latter have the challenge of transforming themselves to address social changes,
cultural and technological that are being presented. Furthermore, they face the need
to provide adequate responses to the expectations of students, teachers,
researchers, administrative staff and society in general (TIC360°, 2017). Fits

socioeconomic, therefore, the need arises to implement digital transformation in
the education sector (Akhmetshin et al., 2020).
This is in view of the fact that digital technologies allow transforming the educational process and
transfer it to a qualitatively new and user-friendly level (Safiullin & Akhmetshin,
2019). For this reason and to guarantee the competitiveness of educational institutions
higher education (IES) the digitalization of its services will be necessary as part of its process
of digital transformation (Safiullin & Akhmetshin, 2019). However, the introduction of
digital technologies in their activities will not be enough, they will also be
necessary cultural and organizational changes (Safiullin & Akhmetshin, 2019). In that
In this sense, the digital transformation in a university will imply changes in all its
processes, taking into account its characteristics and specificity (Safiullin
& Akhmetshin, 2019).
On the other hand, research on digital transformation has been oriented
especially to analyze the effects in the context of business organizations and
business processes (Wilms et al., 2017 & Jackson, 2019). While the
Research on the higher education sector has been incipient. In the
practice, it has been identified that some universities in the world have developed
digital initiatives and strategies to address this transformation process. No
However, these have lacked vision, capacity or commitment, for a
effective implementation within their institutions (McCusker & Babington, 2018). By
This requires research on how HEIs should understand give happiness
digital transformation and the requirements associated with it (L. Mar et al., 2020).
This is the starting point that supports this research, which will be
developed in the following way: from the review of the literature, the
factors that influence digital transformation and are subsequently contrasted with the
opinion of experts in digital transformation processes in IES. For this it is taken
as a case study the National University of Colombia Headquarters Bogotá. These factors
will serve as a basis for those responsible for a digital transformation process in a
Institution of Higher Education.17

digital in Higher Education Institutions, the approach to the problem with
respective research question, objectives, justification and methodology
proposal for research.
1.1 Context
In recent years, digital transformation has become one of the main
trends, both in industry and in the public sector (Kaminskyi et al., 2018). This
It is considered an organic and structural transformation that makes use of resources
of the organization, especially human resources. In addition to this, it supports
in technology, in order to improve organizational performance (Rodrigues, 2017 &
Ventures, 2017). However, these are not the only elements, they are also
relevant organizational culture and strategic planning (Heavin & Power,
2018).
Likewise, digital transformation makes organizations search in a way
permanently secure its competitive position. In order to achieve this, the organization
supports technology, which is the main cause of change and a tool
fundamental to achieve this purpose (Shoham & Perry, 2009). This becomes
relevant to Higher Education Institutions through gives that increases the
competition, mainly, to select the best students and researchers
(Faria & Nóvoa, 2017).19
However, most of those responsible for this transformation lack clarity
about the different options and elements that must be considered. As a consequence,
run the risk of not taking into account important elements or ignoring solutions that
they are more favorable for a specific situation of the organization (Hess et al., 2016).
Furthermore, managers have difficulties in starting the process of
digital transformation related to the prioritization of activities within the
organization (Berghaus & Back, 2017). This transformation challenges managers to
rethink their business models, promote digital innovation, adapt their
strategy, structure and organizational culture to the requirements that this demands. It
The same thing happens in Higher Education Institutions, they have started this
transformation process, but still need to determine the requirements associated with it
(L. Mar et al., 2020).
Transforming a company into a digital company is difficult, however, many
companies have been successful and there are few that have not completed this transformation.
There is no single formula nor is there a guide book or checklist that
managers can follow for the implementation of this process (Economic Forum
World Cup, 2018). Even so, this transformation has begun and is having a profound
impact on all sectors and the educational sector is no exception (EDUCASE,
2018).
1.2 Problem statement
The digital transformation in Higher Education Institutions (IES) has begun,
but there is still a lack of research on how to understand this process, the requirements
necessary to start and those in charge of the process do not have the clarity regarding
the elements to consider. Taking into account the above, the present investigation
Its objective is to contribute with the identification of the factors that influence this
transformation in Colombian HEIs, as the first step within this great process.20 Factors that influence digital transformation in Higher Education Institutions

For the development of this research, the
National University of Colombia Bogotá Headquarters, given its position in the educational sector,
seniority and presence at the national level; Additionally, because it is a university that
has begun its digital transformation process, as outlined in its global plan
development 2019-2021.
1.3 Research Question
What are the factors that influence digital transformation in Education Institutions?
Higher education?
1.4 Objectives
1.4.1 General objective
Identify the factors that influence the digital transformation in the Institutions of
Higher education.
1.4.2 Specific objectives
• Identify in the literature the facts ores related to digital transformation.
• Characterize each of the identified factors that influence the
digital transformation in Higher Education Institutions.
• Contrast with experts the factors previously characterized in the
National University of Colombia Bogotá Headquarters.21
1.5 Methodology
A methodology is a structured set of guidelines or activities to help
people to carry out research or interventions. Generally, a methodology is
develops, implicitly or explicitly, within a particular paradigm and embodies the
assumptions and philosophical principles of the paradigm (Mingers & Brocklesby, 1997).
For this research, the multimethodology of Mingers (2003) was proposed, which is
refers to the use of a plurality of methods or techniques, qualitative and
quantitative, in a real-world intervention. The above, because this methodology
It is complex and multidimensional, which allows a closer view of reality,
while, the use of a single method would be a limited vision. By combining
methodologies, or parts of it, allows us to build an effective combination to try to
comprehensively a particular intervention (Mingers & Brocklesby, 1997).
This is supported by the paradigm of critical realism, which supports the idea of ​​combining
different research methods, what is called mixed methods research or
multimethodology (Mingers et al., 2013). Critical realism directs attention toward the
real problems and their underlying causes (Mingers et al., 2013). According to Bhaskar, the
Critical realism goes against the empiricist vision of science, embodied in the
positivism, and the idealist (social) vision of science, embodied in constructivism or
interpretivism (Mingers et al., 2013).
Due to the above and to answer the research question, the
multimethodology of Mingers & Brocklesby (1997) based on four phases:
• Appreciation: assessment of the problem situation expressed by any
actor of the situation, literature and previous theories (Mingers, 2001).
• Analysis: will involve methods of analysis of the methodologies and data obtained.
in the appreciation stage (Mingers, 2001).22 Factors that influence digital transformation in Information Institutions
Higher education. National University of Colombia Bogotá Headquarters
• Evaluation: evaluation of the postulated explanations and propositions
affirmed within the research, taking into account the objective of visualizing,
differentially, the problem situation (Mingers, 2001).
• Action: for this investigation it corresponds to the presentation and
socialization of the results obtained during the research.
1.5.1 Case study
A component that is part of multimethodology is the case study. This is
used as a research tool applied to organizational studies and
of administration, among others, that contributes to the knowledge iment of phenomena
individual, organizational, social and political (Yin, 2003). A case study can
be a particular organization, project, or procedure, and there may be multiple
cases within a research project (Mingers, 2003). Furthermore, the study of
case often includes methods such as interviews and questionnaires (Mingers, 2003). Of
In this way, it allows the researcher to obtain a holistic view and capture the
significant features of real-life events, e.g., processes
organizational and management, international relations and industry evolution (Yin,
2003).
Taking into account the above, the National University was taken as a case study
of Colombia Bogotá Headquarters, given that among the public HEIs it is the oldest and
representative of the country, due to its coverage and presence at the national level (8 locations). Besides,
It is currently in the beginning stage of a transformation process.
digital, as mentioned in its Global Development Plan 2019-2021 Project
cultural and collective of the nation. This is oriented towards a culture of transformation
digital, through organizational transformation that allows the integration of
teaching, research, extension and administrative support processes, for the
generation of new training processes with digital learning (National University
of Colombia, 2019).23
To analyze the case of the National University of Colombia Bogotá Headquarters, it was taken
as reference the phases of Mingers' multimethodology and Yin's case study.
See figure 1.1.

1.5.2 Delphi method
After the factors influencing the
digital transformation, in the assessment and analysis phases, we proceeded to evaluate
These factors, applied to higher education institutions (HEIs). The latter,
carried out through the Delphi method, which consists of obtaining information from a group
of participants (Zapata & Ebrero, 2010) or panel of experts (Zartha Sossa et al., 2015)
in relation to a certain research objective (Leon and Montero, 2003, cited
in Liaño & Pascual-Ezama, 2012). The result was the perceptions of the experts
(Blasco Mira et al., 2010).24 Factors that influence digital transformation in Information Institutions

1.5.3 Systematic literature review
The systematic literature review was the first technique used in the development
of the present investigation. A systematic review of the literature is a means to
identify, evaluate and interpret all available research relevant to a
particular research question or a topic area or phenomenon of interest
(Kitchenham, 2004). The research initially revolved around the topic of
digital transformation, later it was related to /applied in Institutions of
Higher education.
The methodology that was used for the literature review is presented in figure 1.2,
which was taken from the work of Leitner & Rinderle-Ma (2014). This methodology is based on the
research question to construct the search equations, then, the
an extensive literature search and then additional literature is selected.
Taking into account the resulting data set, the data is extracted and synthesized,
(in this case, the factors that influence digital transformation) and, subsequently,
classify

Figure 1.2 Methodology for the literature review. Taken from (Leitner & Rinderle-Ma,
2014)
Based on the research question, the search equations were constructed and
performed the query through the Scopus databases (https://www.scopus.com) and
Web Of Science https://webofknowledge.com).
The equations that were proposed for the literature review were:
• EQUATION1: "digital transformation" with review.25 filter
• EQUATION2: (“digital transformation” or “digitalization” OR “digitazion”) and
("higher education" OR university* OR HEI OR "educational organization") AND
(“management OR "organizational management" OR "business management" OR
“organizational transformation” OR “organizational change”) and (implement* OR
implant*) and ("factors" OR "enable").
The first search equation was defined for the systematized review that has been
carried out on digital transformation, for this the most cited authors were taken
of the last 10 years.
This allowed us to know, in a general way, definitions, fields of action, challenges and
barriers in this regard.
To define the second search equation, the term was taken
digital transformation and its synonyms digitalization and digitization
(digitization), since these two terms are used as synonyms for transformation
digital, this as a result of the first search equation. Also included were
the terms Higher Education Institutions, its acronym in English HEI, university and
educational organization, given that it intends to investigate digital transformation
in Higher Education Institutions. Additionally, the terms were incorporated
associated with the organizational and management aspect in Education Institutions
Superior and in search of the factors or enablers that influence the transformation
digital.
Literature selection
From the 2 proposed search equations, we continued with the selection of the
literature, raised by Leitner & Rinderle-Ma (2014):
• Filter by knowledge area: according to the databases consulted
Search criteria are applied to include only the areas as of knowledge26 Factors that influence the digital transformation in the Institutions of
Higher education. National University of Colombia Bogotá Headquarters
computer sciences, social sciences, decision sciences, business,
administration and/or accounting, economics, engineering.
• Filter by language: documents found with languages ​​are excluded
different from Spanish or English.
• Elimination of duplicates: once the search is carried out in a database,
Documents found in previous searches are deleted.
• Selection of documents: it is carried out by relevance in terms of the title, summary
and keywords, as well as their access availability.
• Exclusion of documents that are considered not relevant, after reading
total of each document.

2. Digital Transformation
Below are the different definitions of digital transformation
found through the systematic review of the literature.
2.1 Definition of digital transformation
Digital transformation is defined as an organizational change (Boguslavskii &
Neborskii, 2016; Oliver Kohnke, 2016; Rodrigues, 2017; Tekic & Koroteev, 2019 & L. Mar
et al., 2020), which requires a strategy (Pucihar et al., 2017) and uses technologies
digital to improve performance in the organization (Rodrigues, 2017). This change
Organizational encompasses four main areas in the organization: aligning leadership
(digital vision, roles), mobilize the organization (communication), develop capabilities
in employees (digital skills) and guarantee sustainability (indicators and
incentive systems) (Oliver Kohnke, 2016).
Also, 3 elements are categorized within the digital transformation: (1) technological:
is based on the use of new digital technologies such as social networks, devices
mobile, analytics or embedded devices; (2) organizational: requires a change of
organizational processes or the creation of new business models; and, (3) social:
phenomenon that influences all aspects of human life, for example, by improving
customer experience (Amorim & Melao, 2018 & L. Mar et al., 2020).28 Factors that influence digital transformation in Information Institutions

Berghaus & Back Digital transformation encompasses digitalization processes with a
(2016) focus on efficiency and digital innovation with the aim of improving
existing physical products.29
Haffke et al. (2016) Digital transformation encompasses the digitalization of communication channels
sales and communication, which provide new ways to interact
and interact with customers, and the digitalization of products and
services of a company. Digital transformation also describes the

Hess et al. (2016) It has to do with the changes that digital technologies can
cause in the business model of a company, resulting in
modified products or organizational structures or in the
process automation. These changes can be observed in the
increasing demand for Internet-based media, which has led to
complete business model changes (e.g. in the industry
of the music).

These definitions have in common the use of technology as a crucial factor for
improve organizational performance, leading to changes in procedures
and the organizational structure (Fischer et al., 2020), as well as in the offer of new
products or services (Bockshecker et al., 2018). However, the technology within
digital transformation process itself is only one part (Vial, 2019 & Heavin & Power,
2018), because this is a tool and not an end (ANDI, 2017) and alone it will not cause
said transformation (EDUCASE, 2018). On the contrary, it will be accompanied by 30 Factors that influence the digital transformation in the Institutions of

elements such as culture, skills and abilities of staff (Henriette et al.,
2016; Morakanyane et al., 2017), the strategy (Kane, 2017; Morakanyane et al., 2017), the
organizational structure and leadership (Kane, 2017).
Therefore, digital transformation is developed from initiatives that are generated from
gradually throughout the organization or segments of it, over time (Hess
et al., 2016 & Kane, 2017). The success of these initiatives depends on how senior management
coordinates them as they are executed at the same time (Oswald & Kleinemeier, 2016),
as well as the management of the investment that these demand (Mugge et al., 2020).
Likewise, digital transformation can be oriented towards different results. For example,
In the case of a manufacturing company, the digital transformation process can
mean the automation of processes, to deliver better quality products to the
customer at a faster pace, while for the service industry this can
mean digitizing and improving communication and customer touchpoints
(Gebayew et al., 2018).
2.2 Digital transformation, digitization and
digitization
Through the literature review, the terms digital transformation appeared,
digitization and digitization, which are used synonymously yes, although it is not appropriate
since each term is different (Legner et al., 2017; Bockshecker et al., 2018 & Cerstin
Mahlow & Hediger, 2019).
Digitization refers to the integration of IT with existing tasks (Verhoef et al.,
2019), for example reading online texts as PDFs, not as paper textbooks
(Cerstin Mahlow & Hediger, 2019).
Digitalization, for its part, is a transformation process induced by
technology, which improves the flexibility, agility and responsiveness of a
organization by simultaneously aligning its operations, strategies, processes31
business, organizational and IT structures (Imgrund et al., 2018). This refers, for
For example, the creation of new communication channels with online customers or
mobile, through the use of digital forms in order processes, the use of
digital surveys or the use of digital applications, which implies transforming the
internal and external documentation processes, but does not change the activities of
value creation (Verhoef et al., 2019). Another example worth highlighting is the realization of
annotations in a PDF document and that these annotations can be viewed with
other people (Cerstin Mahlow & Hediger, 2019).
Bockshecker et al. (2018) suggests that digitization and digitization trigger
digital phenomena that allow organizations to operationalize the process of
digital transformation.
For Agarwal et al. (2010) digital transformation is a phenomenon that encompasses the entire
organization and that seeks innovation of the core business model, through the use
of digital technology. For example, in the health sector there is widespread use
of IT, enabling a fundamental change in the provision of health services and
interaction with suppliers, customers and competitors. Another example, in the sector
automotive is Volvo Cars; This one is hiring digital executives and dedicates a part
important part of your investment in R&D or digital initiatives to carry out projects
digital such as automated driving (Verhoef et al., 2019).
2.3 Challenges of digital transformation
Regarding the challenges that a digital transformation process entails, Oliver
Kohnke (2016) presents a study carried out by 2 consulting firms, where
mention the most important challenges that organizations face
when they start this process. See table 2-2.32 Factors that influence the digital transformation in the Institutions of

Italicized text indicates challenges related to people and the organization (Oliver
Kohnke, 2016)
According to table 2-2, in the first study half of the challenges are
related to people and the available budget; followed by the lack of
leadership and the lack of digital talent (both functional and technical). Other challenges are the
lack of senior management involvement or desire to change current practices,
associated with an organizational structure designed inappropriately for the process
of transformation. In the second study, the lack of leadership and skills stands out33
in digital projects, together with the lack of a mentality open to experimentation and
low participation of top management to change current practices.
Both studies demonstrate the importance of people and organizational aspects
for a digital transformation process (Oliver Kohnke, 2016). Faced with this, the
Professor Raffi Amit of Wharton mentions that “it is not technology that is the obstacle to
digital transformation, it is the people” (Cited in Bonnet, 2015, p. 8).
In Colombia, with the digital transformation survey carried out by the National Association
of Entrepreneurs of Colombia (ANDI) in 2017, the following barriers were identified and
challenges that companies face to achieve a successful digital transformation. See
figure 1.4.
Lack of human capital 26.8%
Lack of leadership 42.9%
Lack of a clear business model 46.4%
Lack of mentality 50.9%
Budget 56.3%
Lack of knowledge 61.6%
Lack of culture 74.1%
Figure 1. 4 Barriers and challenges that companies face to achieve a digital transformation
successful. Own elaboration with data from the ANDI 2017 Digital Transformation Survey.
It can be concluded that the challenges and barriers evidenced in Oliver's article
Kohnke (2016) and the ANDI survey (2017) have aspects in common such as: the lack
of culture and leadership, the lack of a mentality open to change, the lack of
budget and the lack of a clear business model.34 Factors that influence the digital transformation in the Institutions of
Higher education. National University of Colombia Bogotá Headquarters
2.4 Impacts of digital transformation
The impacts of digital transformation focus on the customer and the organization
(Morakanyane et al., 2017). The impact on the organization occurs in three areas:
customer experience, operational processes and business models (Westerman et al.,
2014).
Through the customer experience, on the one hand, the innovation of the
services within the organization and, on the other hand, customer retention and loyalty
with this (Westerman et al., 2014). Regarding operational processes, these can
generate effects in improving the efficiency of the organization, save costs for both
the organization as well as the customer, resulting in the creation of value (Morakanyane
et al., 2017). Regarding business models, the reinvention of this is a process
of digital transformation that sometimes involves radically changing products or
services it offers and the means it uses for sales. This reinvention can lead
to change the nature of competition in your industry or reconfigure your supply chain
value to offer an efficiency advantage over its competitors (Westerman et al.,
2014).
2.5 Digital transformation in Colombia
For the digital transformation process in Colombia, the National Policy Council
Economic and Social (CONPES) defined the document CONPES 3975 called
“National Policy for Digital Transformation and Artificial Intelligence”, which aims to
aim:
” enhance the generation of social and economic value in the country through the strategic use of
digital technologies in the public sector and the private sector, to boost productivity and
promote the well-being of citizens, as well as generate transversal enablers for the
sectoral digital transformation, so that Colombia can take advantage of the opportunities and
face the challenges related to the Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR)” [SIC].
The topic of digital transformation is transversal to all sectors of the
country (Mintic, 2019), including the educational sector.35
2.6 Digital transformation in educational institutions
Higher education
EDUCASE (2018) highlights that traditional higher education is reluctant to change and
to risks, being slow to act. Additionally, IDC (2016) mentions that the
Most Higher Education Institutions seem oblivious to the changes in the
society and prefer to continue working with teaching and learning processes of
last century, making marginal use of information technologies. Without
However, it must be considered that if HEIs want to persist over time and not
disappear, it is necessary that they evolve integrally and begin a process of
digital transformation (L. Mar et al., 2020).
On the other hand, some HEIs have seen digital transformation as an opportunity to
recontextualize learning (Cerstin Mahlow & Hediger, 2019). Thus, the HEIs have
started to introduce technologies that allow creating learning contexts
called “anytime” and “anywhere” (Tay & Low, 2017). Authors
as Safiullin & Akhmetshin (2019) call it “Open University” which is the
implementation of affordable distance education programs for people of
everyone, regardless of location, through the use of platforms
web, collaborative cloud environments, massive online courses, flipped classroom, collective
intelligence, etc. (Mareca & Bordel, 2019). Distance education programs
under MOOCs (massive open online courses) seem to be one of the main
drivers of change faced by Higher Education institutions (Mar &
Amescua, 2017).
Now, at the organizational level, in universities the existence of a
internal fragmentation of processes and a diversity of data, given that these
The latter are dispersed in various information repositories, including
found duplicates, being difficult to compare due to differences in the
format, metadata, conventions and terminology used (Safiullin & Akhmetshin, 2019).
This situation generates an opportunity within the digital transformation process.36 Factors that influence digital transformation in Information Institutions
Higher education. National University of Colombia Bogotá Headquarters
An example of digital transformation in an HEI is the case presented by Faria &
Nóvoa (2017) from the University of Porto in Portugal, which consisted of the creation of
a new shared services center, with the aim of improving the quality of services
delivered to the community, which reduces overall costs and generates easy access
to its users. This center collected all the services that were provided in each of
schools and centralized them, which required a reengineering process of the entire
university, a new work management system and an organizational culture that
responded to these changes.
2.7 Digital evolution at the National University of
Colombia (case study)
Before talking about the National University of Colombia as a case study, it is
It is necessary to mention what a Higher Education Institution is in Colombia and its
characteristics. The Ministry of National Education defines Educational Institutions
Superior (IES) as “…entities that have, in accordance with legal regulations, the
official recognition as providers of the public service of higher education in
the Colombian territory” (Higher Education Institutions - Ministry of Education
National of Colombia, 2010). Higher Education Institutions are classified
according to their academic character and legal nature (Higher Education Institutions -
Ministry of National Education of Colombia, 2010).
The academic character constitutes the main feature that since the creation of a
higher education institution defines and gives identity with respect to the competition (field
of action) that, in academic terms, allows it to offer and develop education programs
higher in one or another academic modality (Ministry of National Education, 2020).
This academic character is classified into four categories as follows:
• Professional Technical Institutions: at the undergraduate level: technical programs
professionals. At the postgraduate level: professional technical specializations.37
• Technological Institutions: at the undergraduate level: technical programs
professionals and technological programs. At the postgraduate level: specializations
professional techniques and technological specializations.
• University Institutions or Technological Schools: at the undergraduate level:
professional technical programs, technological programs and programs
professionals. At the postgraduate level: professional technical specializations,
technological specializations and professional specializations.
• Universities: at the undergraduate level: professional technical programs,
technological programs and professional programs. At the graduate level:
professional technical specializations, technological specializations,
professional specializations and master's and doctoral degrees.
In addition to this, depending on the legal nature, HEIs can be private or public.
(Higher Education Institutions - Ministry of National Education of Colombia,
2010). Private HEIs must be organized as useful legal entities
common, non-profit, established as corporations, foundations or institutions
of solidarity economy. Public or state HEIs are classified into establishments
public and autonomous university entities. The first ones have guardianship control
general as a public establishment and the latter enjoy order prerogatives
constitutional and legal and budgetary autonomy. All public universities
They make up the System of State Universities (SUE).
According to statistics from the Ministry of National Education, for 2018, the
distribution of IES in the country was the following:
• University: 86 IES, which corresponds to 29% (official 32, special regime 1, not
officer 53)
• University Institution: 134 IES, which corresponds to 45% (official 18, regime
special 13, unofficial 103)
• Technological institution: 48 IES, which corresponds to 16% (official 5, regime
special 6, unofficial 37)38 Factors that influence the digital transformation in the Institutions of
Higher education. National University of Colombia Bogotá Headquarters
• Professional technological institution: 30 IES that corresponds to 10% (official 9, not
official 21).
The National University of Colombia is an HEI “…created in 1867 through the

To know in a general way the technological and organizational changes that it has undergone
the University, interviews were carried out with professors and professionals who have
participated in these changes. Below is a general presentation of the
results of the interviews, see figure 1.5.39
Figure 1. 5 Technological changes at the National University of Colombia, based on the
interviews conducted.
The National University of Colombia began its technological change with the acquisition of
an IBM computer at the end of 1960, along with two private companies in the country, including
Knitting. This equipment began to be used to perform engineering calculations and the
training mainly of engineering students. It was then used to rate the
Admission exams.
Later, a building called the Computer Center was created. Initially this was

Later, the Information and Processes Office was created, an independent office of the Center
computing, but interrelated, which was in charge of some administrative tasks
of the University.
Also, in accordance with the budgetary provision of the departments and faculties
the acquisition of microcomputers began; the first offices to acquire these
The teams were Accounting and Personnel, and in the Faculties, the first was the
Faculty of Economic Sciences of the Bogotá Campus.
Given all this technological boom, several administrations have sought to organize and
rationalize activities and tasks within the university, supported with the use of
available technology and the information systems that have been created and implemented
with the help of students and professors, mainly from the Faculty of Engineering.40 Factors that influence digital transformation in Engineering Institutions

Among the computer software that the University initially acquired were
SPSS, word processor (wordstar), electronic spreadsheet (Lotus 123), database
data (dBASE), microisis (database to manage libraries), becoming
intensive at all University locations. With the arrival of the internet, the 4 headquarters

generated a computer-type decentralization.
Subsequently, the University acquired information systems such as SARA, QUIPU,
UNIVERSITAS XXI (today SIA), to support human talent processes, management
financial and academic processes, respectively. These were implemented in a way
independent in each headquarters, with a decentralization in the operation given the
Internet conditions and bandwidth. From this the

mainly that of students given the mobility that can occur between locations.
2.7.1 Digital Transformation at the National University of
Colombia
The issue of digital transformation at the National University of Colombia is coming
reviewing for several years, as mentioned in the document found
in the review stage called “Digital transformation strategy, proposal for a
institutional policy (proposal)”. For 2018, the identification of weaknesses was carried out
in digital matters throughout the University and the transformation project was proposed
digital aligned with the Global Development Plan 2018-2021, the Vision41 Institutional Plan
2034 and the Strategic Plan for Information and Communications Technologies (Peti)
(National University of Colombia, 2021).
In the words of Rector Dolly Montoya (2018-2021) about the University “…our
administration is from the 19th century but computerized…and we have a bureaucracy
paralyzing", with digital transformation the aim is, in general terms, to "improve and
transform the transformable”, through the integrated harmonization of the
missionary functions with the activities of university life (National University of
Colombia, 2021).
For the University, implementing a digital transformation process aims to
purpose “…support the formation of integral citizens as agents of change with
social awareness, and support their development in ethics, change management, leadership
collective, among others, through various strategies and the use of digital tools,
as a central element for expanding the development of missionary functions in the
university community” (National University of Colombia, 2021, page 7).
I c ual affects “…the training activities and their evaluations; the approaches
pedagogical; research and resource management processes and projection
from UNAL to society” (National University of Colombia, 2021, page 8).
Within this digital transformation project, the construction of the
bet scenario or “priority 1” to 2030, that is, the projection that they have of the
digital transformation of the university by 2030, based on the definition of dimensions and
the prioritization of change factors, which are mentioned in table 2-3.42 Factors that influence the digital transformation in the Institutions of

3. Factors that influence the
digital transformation
The factors that influence a digital transformation process provide a point
starting point to create successful transformations in organizations (Heavin & Power,
2018, Oliver Kohnke, 2016). These factors must be identified for their
implementation in organizations from different sectors (Pihir et al., 2019).
By conducting a literature review of the factors that influence the transformation
digital it was found that authors such as Morakanyane et al. (2017) highlight that the
digital technologies, culture, strategy and capital to the human with knowledge
Digital ones are what enable the digital transformation process. Bonnet & Nandan
(2011) and George Westerman et al. (2014) highlight that organizational change is one
of the critical factors for any digital transformation process. Furthermore, they define
this change as the application of specific interventions, to support the transition
of an individual or group from a current state to a desired future state. That is, of the
people who have to change their way of working and thinking, due to the
digital transformation.
Oliver Kohnke (2016) associates organizational change with three other factors: new
skills and competencies, new forms of leadership and new capabilities
organizational. Depending on the degree to which organizations develop these
factors, its culture will evolve towards a "digital mentality".44 Factors that influence the digital transformation in the Institutions of
Higher education. National University of Colombia Bogotá Headquarters

Own elaboration based on Fischer et al. (2020), Imgrund et al. (2018), Pihir et al. (2019) and
Rodrigues (2017).
Below is a description of the factors identified in the review of
Literature.
3.1 Digital strategy
The digital strategy is a multifunctional strategy, which addresses all functions,
processes and procedures of the organization (Fehér et al., 2017 & Bienhaus & Haddud,
2018). Strategy is the strongest differentiating aspect of organizations that
They have digital maturity. This is not limited to technological problems such as the use of
mobile devices or migration to the cloud, but shows how the organization
can and should do business differently in the market (Kane, 2017).45
For this reason, the digital strategy must include objectives, an action plan and communication
(Imgrund et al., 2018), assignment of clear and appropriate responsibilities for their
implementation (Matt et al., 2015). Likewise, it must be led from senior management.
(Westerman & Bonnet, 2014; Hess et al., 2016; Horlacher et al., 2016; Dremel et al.,
2017; Pihir et al., 2019), under the responsibility of a director who must align with
all strategies that can affect the entire organization (Matt et al., 2015), including
them IT strategy and business strategy (Bharadwaj et al., 2013; Matt et al., 2015
& Hess et al., 2016).
In the digital strategy, four dimensions can be identified that must be coordinated
harmoniously:
• Use of technologies: reflects a company's approach and ability to
explore and implement new digital technologies (Hess et al., 2016 &
Rodrigues, 2017).
• Central processes (administration, education and research): changes in
organizational structures (Hess et al., 2016 & Rodrigues, 2017), functions,
processes and procedures of the organization (Fehér et al., 2017 & Bienhaus &
Haddud, 2018). In the processes, it is necessary to define methods that involve the
workers in all the changes that the digital transformation entails, since
can generate resistance to these changes (Westerman & Bonnet, 2014).
• Financial aspects associated with the ability to finance the effort of the
digital transformation (Hess et al., 2016): a provision of funds is required
sufficient, since unforeseen developments can affect the initiatives of said
transformation (Imgrund et al., 2018). In the case of HEIs, technologies
emerging markets tend to be expensive, which, combined with financial constraints
that they face can make said transformation difficult. Therefore, it is necessary
ensure that the necessary resources are available for its implementation
(Rodrigues, 2017).46 Factors that influence digital transformation in Information Institutions
Higher education. National University of Colombia Bogotá Headquarters
• Interest groups (stakeholders): students, graduates, faculty, administration,
industries, society, among others (Rodrigues, 2017).
Regarding the projection of a digital strategy, it is highlighted that it is 10 years (Kane,
2017).
3.2 Organizational Culture
The organizational culture in the digital transformation process is perceived as a
valuable strategic asset, which has the potential to support such transformation and the
implementation n of digital technologies (Westerman et al., 2011 & Downes et al., 2013).
This transformation generates the development of new products and processes that require
of an organizational culture with an open, digital, innovative mentality and with a
change orientation (Kane et al., 2017 ; Westerman et al., 2011; Fitzgerald et al., 2013).
Organizational culture is formed from shared values ​​and beliefs of employees.
members of an organization about what is considered desirable (Deal 1991). barney
(1986) also defines it as a complex set of values, beliefs, assumptions
and symbols that define the way a company conducts its business.
In turn, Hartl & Hess (2017) highlight the following organizational values ​​for the
success of digital transformation, table 3-2.47

Cross-functional cooperation and readiness for cooperation with external partners (e.g.

Own elaboration based on Hartl & Hess (2017).
Regarding the value of tolerance for failure, those responsible for digital transformation
They must foster an organizational culture based on: evidence for decision-making
decisions, learning from failure and motivation to introduce employees to
innovate through cross-functional teams (Dremel et al., 2017). Authors like Fischer
et al. (2020) and Dasgupta & Gupta (2010) regarding the value of risk affinity, propose
that organizations must have an open-minded culture that facilitates
creativity and risk taking. On the other hand, Kane et al. (2017), regarding the value of the
agility, mention that an organization supported by this value could facilitate the
restructuring or the adoption of new management concepts. Regarding the value48 Factors that influence the digital transformation in the Institutions of
Higher education. National University of Colombia Bogotá Headquarters
willingness to learn, Jöhnk et al. (2017) highlight that organizations can
encourage learning through small incremental and iterative changes.
Another important aspect that must be taken into account within the process of
Digital transformation is the promotion of a data-driven culture (Heavin & Power,
2018; Fischer et al., 2020; Mugge et al., 2020). The data must be perceived as a
valuable resource that can help an organization become a
digital and thus achieve a competitive advantage. For this reason, it is necessary to establish a culture
of data exchange that allows, for example, business functions
take advantage of this data for decision making (Dremel et al., 2017).
3.2.1 Leadership
Another important aspect within a digital transformation process is leadership.
This is a subfactor associated with the organizational culture factor, where the
Managers and leaders are responsible for providing guidance throughout everything.
the process, communicate the vision to the entire organization and try to reduce resistance from
employees, which frequently occurs in organizations (Mugge et al., 2020).
These leaders directly impact employee performance and failure.
or the success of digital transformation (Kane et al., 2017).
Maedche (2016) and Bienhaus & Haddud (2018) mention that these managers must
be inspiring people who drive the digital transformation process throughout the company
organization. Likewise, new forms of leadership, skills and
organizational capabilities, which have the potential to evolve the culture of
an organization, towards a culture more open to innovation driven by
technology (Kane et al., 2017). Within organizational capabilities, the effort and
Teamwork is essential. It is about articulating functional areas, working very
closely with the R&D area and with the different business lines (Maedche, 2016).49
3.2.2 Resistance to change
Another subfactor that is part of the organizational culture factor is resistance to
change. Authors such as Hartl & Hess (2017) and Rodrigues (2017) point out that culture
organizational can be the main source of inertia that prevents the change in one
organization. Disagreements and conflicts in organizations are seen as
expressions of resistance to change, but, if handled properly, the
Disagreements can also fuel innovation and learning (Hansen, et al.,
2011).
However, resistance to change is defined as the main operational risk of a company.
organization. Organizations have learned that errors in adaptation and
digital economy can be lethal. For example, Blockbuster once controlled the largest
part of the movie rental business, but was unable to adapt its business model to
new digital platforms such as Netflix; Thus, Blockbuster declared bankruptcy in
2010 (Mugge et al., 2020).
3.3 Digital expertise
Another factor identified within a digital transformation process is expertise.
digital, related to the capabilities, skills and training of personnel on topics
digital, aligned with the digital strategy (Fischer et al., 2020). For this, it is required
of clearly defined roles and responsibilities within this process that support
top management (Dremel et al., 2017).
Currently, digital transformation moves in highly dynamic markets,
pressing employees to continually adapt to new situations,
increasing their need for agility and thus demanding a greater need for
lifelong learning (Brosi et al., 2020). At the organizational level, managers must
carefully evaluate existing technological capabilities (Hess et al. 2016;
Morakanyane et al., 2017) and identify in the staff the new competencies and 50 Factors that influence the digital transformation in the Institutions of
Higher education. National University of Colombia Bogotá Headquarters
required skills (Colbert et al., 2016 ; Morakanyane et al., 2017; Fehér et al.,
2017; Pucihar et al., 2017 & EDUCASE, 2018).
To develop these skills and competencies, the organization must provide
training for employees (Colbert et al., 2016; Bienhaus & Haddud, 2018 & Mugge et
al., 2020). Another option is the subcontracting of personnel for the implementation of the
digital transformation process, which can have advantages in terms of fewer
initial investments and spreading risks more widely. However, the
The disadvantage of this option is that it increases the risk of both losing a competition
required as of becoming dependent on a third party, therefore, it must be maintained
training processes for internal employees to obtain a competitive advantage
(Hess et al., 2016). An option proposed by Dremel et al. (2017) compared to the beginning of a
digital transformation process is to have an external consultancy at the same time
develop technical skills and internal competencies in the organization.
Now, faced with the responsibility of senior management, it begins with the definition of a
digital strategy, which is often delegated to a manager higher entity that could be the
manager of the digital area or of a business unit affected by said process of
transformation (Hess et al., 2016). This person will be fully responsible and would add
authority to strategy. Authors such as Heavin & Power (2018) raise the need to
hire a Digital Director (Chief Digital Officer -CDO), who is focused on change
organizational and customer. Other authors such as Matt et al. (2015) mention that even
There is no clear answer as to which top manager should be in charge of the
digital transformation, possible candidates can be CIO (Chief Information Officer -
(Chief Information Officer), the CEO or the relatively new role of the Chief Digital Officer (CDO).
However, some organizations have created the position CDO (Chief Digital Officer -
Digital Director), who has a key responsibility for defining the strategy
and digital transformation activities, as well as managing new technologies
digital and drive change in the organization, becoming a focal leader (Singh et
al., 2019 & Pereira et al., 2020). Among the competencies that a CDO must possess are
They find IT skills and resilience. IT competencies to formulate the51
IT requirements and coordination of digital products; and the resilience to cope
to the problems that arise in the face of digital transformation (Pereira et al., 2020).
Apart from the roles mentioned above, new roles appear such as the boss
data officer, data scientist or data analyst. In the field of marketing
new functions appear such as the person in charge of the marketing study oriented to
web and social networks (Community Manager) (Henriette et al., 2016).
3.4 Organizational flexibility
The organizational flexibility factor appears as a relevant factor within the
digital transformation, given that it requires flexible organizational structures and
line with rapidly and continually changing market conditions (Dremel
et al., 2017 & Fischer et al., 2020). Therefore, agile organizations are required (Oliver
Kohnke, 2016; Fettig et al., 2018 & Imgrund et al., 2018), scalable and adaptable, to
respond to changes in the environment (Imgrund et al., 2018).
Vial (2019) defines organizational agility as the ability of an organization to
detect innovation opportunities and take advantage of them quickly in the market,
gathering the necessary assets, knowledge and relationships. Pihir et al. (2019)
complement, by highlighting that these resources must be implemented or redirected
efficient and effective way to create value for the organization. Therefore, a structure
Flexible organizational structure includes flat hierarchies, independent work, and freedom of
decision for employees.
A major challenge for most organizations today is that
have traditional hierarchy-based decision-making processes uias,
multiple levels of management and area-based thinking, which often leads to
processes that are too slow to deal with the interfunctional, technological and 52 Factors that influence digital transformation in Information Institutions
Higher education. National University of Colombia Bogotá Headquarters
rapid digital transformation (Oliver Kohnke, 2016 & Verhoef et al., 2019). Are
Rigid hierarchical corporate structures are losing importance in a process
of digital transformation (Fettig et al., 2018).
3.5 Collaboration
Regarding collaboration within a digital transformation process, Oswald &
Kleinemeier (2016) and Fischer et al. (2020) propose that organizations must
prepare your organizational processes, ensure adequate communication by
Using technology to connect and collaborate with your stakeholders
internal and external. Since digital transformation seeks to improve the customer experience
client (Amorim & Melao, 2018), the IT area must have a very close collaboration
with the commercial area, to satisfy real needs of its clients (Dremel et al.,
2017). In the case of Higher Education Institutions, Kaminskyi et al. (2018)
highlight that corporate IT architecture is the basis for digital transformation,
showing that digital technologies improve the provision of educational services
and the student experience.
3.6 Customer orientation
The digital transformation must be focused on the customer, monitoring their experiences and
predicting their needs (Pihir et al., 2018 & Schwaferts & Baldi, 2018); to the
understanding their behavior and its impact on the organization (Rodrigues, 2017).
In this sense, digital transformation opens up possibilities of targeting new customers
and new customer segments (Schwaferts & Baldi, 2018). According to Westerman et al.,
(2014), customer experience must be the center of the digital transformation, designed
from the outside in, customer participation must be given through new
digital channels and data and analytics are the vital elements of the reinvention of
this experience.53
In the case of HEIs, they have different clients: students, graduates,
teachers, administration, parents, industries, society, among others, who have
different behaviors towards technology, that is where the digital strategy must
contemplate how these will adapt and make efficient use of them (Rodrigues, 2017).
In the case of students, they demand an improvement in their experience with
university; For example, in terms of administrative processes, the access available
24 hours a day to all information and services through digital platforms
(Rodrigues, 2017). Another important aspect is the information channels, Schwaferts &
Baldi (2018) highlight that using an inappropriate or obsolete channel with the client can
mean the loss of a business opportunity and represent a threat to the
digital transformation.54 Factors that influence the digital transformation in the Institutions of

4. Evaluation of factors
characterized by experts
(Application of the Delphi method)
Once the factors have been identified and characterized, based on the literature review,
We proceed with the evaluation of these through the experts who are part of the
case study, National University of Colombia Bogotá Campus. For this, we used the
Delphi method. According to Zapata & Ebrero (2010) this method is “…prospective that is
based on the superiority of forecasting and diagnosis of a group, with respect to the
results that are obtained from an individual, the quality of the subjective group opinion is
superior to the individual” (p. 316).
This method involves the selection of experts (Varela-ruiz et al., 2012), who are
sends a series of questionnaires (Zapata & Ebrero, 2010) in anonymous communication with
feedback (Zartha Sossa et al., 2015) and in different rounds they are asked for their opinion
(Zapata & Ebrero, 2010).
For this investigation, two rounds were applied, considered appropriate by
Zapata & Ebrero (2010) to obtain information from experts and achieve consensus
and stability in their responses. “…The number of rounds to be carried out, it is common to carry out
carry out three rounds and set them in advance of the study, however, the limitations
temporal, budgetary and the difficulty of maintaining the commitment of experts,
they mean that in few cases a third round is carried out” (Zapata & Ebrero, 2010).
The Delphi method has three characteristics: the anonymity of the participants, feedback
or controlled feedback and group statistical response (Zapata & Ebrero,55
2010). Regarding the anonymity of the participants or experts, it must be ensured that
No participant can know the answers given by the other participants so
as their identity (Zapata & Ebrero, 2010). Regarding feedback, this
consists of the transmission of information to the experts before each round, in order to
know the results obtained in the previous round or stage (Zapata & Ebrero, 2010).
The statistical group response, “…arises from the answers given by the experts to
the questionnaires, whose information is treated statistically to know the degree of
agreement that has been obtained on the topic analyzed” (Zapata & Ebrero, 2010, p. 316).
Experts may reflect and reconsider their position due to new
approaches (Landaeta, 2002). In this way, the Delphi method ends when
There is a consensus in the opinions and these stabilize during the rounds or stages
carried out (Zapata & Ebrero, 2010).
4.1 Selection of experts
An expert is “…that individual whose situation and personal resources enable him
contribute positively to the achievement of the goal that motivated the initiation of the work
Delphi” (Landaeta, 2002; cited in Zapata & Ebrero, 2010). An expert assumes the
responsibility to issue judgments and opinions (Varela-ruiz et al., 2012). As for the
The number of experts must be a minimum of 7 and a maximum of 30 experts (Varela-ruiz et al., 2012).
For this research, two types of experts defined by Álvarez &
Torrado (2016) thus: the first type called Affected are key experts who
Regardless of their titles or hierarchical position, they have participated in processes
diagnoses or involved in similar situations, know the situation under study. In
In this case, the experts (professors who have held academic-administrative positions or
have been advisors to the areas involved) have participated in change processes

professional experience in the field of digital transformation and changes56 Factors that influence digital transformation in Institutions of

organizational, associated with the implementation of new technologies in Institutions
Public Higher Education.
These two types of experts must meet the following criteria, willingness to
participate and availability of time in the present research (Álvarez & Torrado,
2016). The level of knowledge is also taken into account (Zapata & Ebrero, 2010 &
Blasco Mira et al., 2010) associated with the academic studies that the expert has:
undergraduate, specialization, master's, doctorate. Added to this are the years of experience
(Zartha Sossa et al., 2015).

digital transformation in institutions of Higher Education.
4.2 Development of the first round
4.2.1 Formulation of the questionnaire
The construction of the questionnaire for the first round or iteration was based on the
factors and subfactors that influence digital transformation identified in the review
from the literature, table 4-2.
Table 4-2 Factors and subfactors identified in the literature review
Factor Subfactor
Digital Strategy
Organizational Culture Resistance to change
Leadership
Digital Expertise
Organizational flexibility
Collaboration
Customer orientation
Within the Organizational Culture factor, the subfactors are included: Resistance to
change and Leadership, given that, in the review of the literature, they are discriminated
and described in detail within said factor, as mentioned in chapter
3. For each of these factors and subfactors, a detailed description of the
itself and how these influence the digital transformation.
To structure the questionnaires for the first and second round,
Likert-type questions, where the statements were rated from 1 to 5 depending on the degree of
agreement of the expert with each of them: C1 - Completely disagree, C2 - In
disagree, C3- Neither agree nor disagree, C4- Agree, C5- Totally agree
agreement. Each qualification had to be justified.58 Factors that influence the digital transformation in the Institutions of

They were sent an invitation in which the title of the research was mentioned, which is why
which they were invited as experts and in general the Delphi method. In addition,
They were asked to confirm their willingness and availability to participate in the research.
The questionnaire was also attached, which had 5 parts, namely: 1) title of the
investigation, 2) presentation and instructions, 3) personal data of the expert, 4)
questionnaire with the factors and subfactors and description of each of them with area
rating with a Likert-type scale and 5) space for the inclusion of new factors, to
judgment of each expert. See annex A. 10 experts responded to this communication,
confirmed their willingness and availability to participate, they also sent a completed
the questionnaire in its entirety.
4.2.3 First round results
Once the questionnaires from the first round were received, we proceeded to consolidate the
responses received for each factor evaluated. The results were analyzed through
central tendency statistics such as the median and position statistics such as quartiles (Q1,
Q2 and Q3) (Zapata & Ebrero, 2010). These data allowed us to observe the information
about the distribution of the responses of the group of experts. It will also be used n
measures of dispersion such as the interquartile range (RI) and the standard deviation (S),
table 4-3.
The interquartile range (IRR) was defined as a consensus measure (Zapata & Ebrero,
2010). This reveals the degree of dispersion of the experts' responses and is
determined like this: RIR= (Q3-Q1)/Median. The degree of consensus is presented with a range
low interquartile (Zapata & Ebrero, 2010). RIR < 0.5, it is considered to exist
consensus. The consensus levels were established as follows: high consensus when RIR <
0.2, acceptable consensus for RIR > 0.2 and RIR < 0.5, and low consensus for RIR > 0.5.59
Table 4-3 Degree of consensus of the factors that were evaluated by the experts in the
first round

Organizational flexibility 4.0 3.0 4.0 4.8 0.9 0.4 Acceptable Consensus
The highest degree of consensus was achieved for the Organizational Culture factor (RIR = 0).
Followed by the factors Digital strategy, Resistance to change, Leadership and Orientation
to the client (RIR=0.2). In that order, the Collaboration factor continues with a level of
acceptable consensus (RIR=0.3) and the factors Digital Expertise and Flexibility
organizational (RIR = 0.4).
The median results fluctuate between 4 and 5 for all factors, except
of the collaboration factor (Me=3.5), which means that this last factor, according to
the opinion of the experts, needs to be a factor that has little influence on the process of
digital transformation, together with the result of the interquartile range (RIR=0.3).
When analyzing the standard deviation (S), the lowest dispersion of the responses occurs in the
Organizational Culture factor (s=0.0), followed by the Leadership subfactor (s=0.5) and the
subfactor Resistance to change (s=0.7). Thus, with the values ​​of the median and the
standard deviation, it is confirmed that the organizational culture factor is the factor that most
influences the digital transformation process.
Additionally, in the questionnaire of this first round, the experts were asked if
In their opinion, they considered that there were other factors other than those mentioned,
they could include them; The experts included 5 factors, table 4-4.60 Factors that influence the digital transformation in the Institutions of

4.2.4 Qualitative analysis of the first round
Once the experts' responses have been consolidated, the
justification given by the experts against each factor they evaluated:
Organizational Culture Factor
This factor obtained the highest consensus and the lowest dispersion of responses among
experts, followed by its two subfactors: Resistance to change and Leadership. This
shows that experts fully agree that this factor influences a
digital transformation process.
One expert highlighted that “… digital transformation is not a matter of technology, it is a
“organizational issue that involves the culture of the organization”. Another expert, in turn,
pointed out that “…public Higher Education Institutions are very traditional,
who live in contact with the most recent advances in science, culture and art, which
generates a tension between the traditional and change, requiring an effort to change
organizational”.
Also, in general, experts associate organizational culture with the
people and their behavior in the organization. One expert indicated that “…the values ​​and
Staff beliefs can facilitate or hinder the digital transformation of the company.
organization, and more so in the case of public HEIs where the staff has been
linked, there is resistance to change.” One expert also highlighted that for61
“…the success of a digital transformation requires the appropriation of a culture
digital". Additionally, they point out that the organizational culture must be transformed
so that the digital strategy can be satisfactorily integrated.
Subfactor Resistance to change
Regarding this subfactor, an expert mentioned that “…public HEIs are organizations
conservatives resistant to change and this resistance is part of the culture
organizational, therefore, is a very great influence on digital transformation.”
They also mention that digital transformation requires elements such as customer management.
change, as highlighted by an expert “…change management must be applied throughout the entire
transformation process so that this change can be effectively internalized”,
Another expert emphasized that “…it takes being creative for people to support the
transformation".
Likewise, within this factor it stands out that people are the main axis of the
digital transformation, as pointed out by an expert “…Every digital transformation process
In an HEI you must keep in mind a natural element in people and that is resistance.
To the change. This management must be carried out by an interdisciplinary team.”
Leadership Subfactor
The experts considered the Leadership subfactor important and influential within a
digital transformation process. One expert mentioned that “…without leadership it is difficult
said process.” Regarding the responsibility of leading the process of
transformation, an expert indicated “…It must be led from the rectorship of the IES.”
Furthermore, the experts highlighted that leadership must be focused on people and their
transformation, which is not something easy or immediate. “…It must be led by a team62 Factors that influence digital transformation in Information Institutions

In addition to its expertise on the subject, it must be an interdisciplinary team, thought more
beyond the technological, which recognizes the importance of medium and long-term objectives
term, above the immediate results.”
Digital Strategy
This factor was evaluated by the experts and obtained a high level of consensus. The result of
The median shows that the majority of experts strongly agree that
This factor influences a digital transformation process. They highlight that the IES
Public authorities in general have a functional and hierarchical organizational structure, therefore,
A digital strategy defined by senior management is required to align and give
authority to digital transformation projects.
An expert mentioned, regarding the Digital Strategy, that “…implement a strategy

performance and its competitive advantage is maintained so that it is sustainable in the future.

On the other hand, another expert highlighted that a digital Strategy is not enough as a factor
of influence, “…a digital strategy is insufficient. Beyond a strategy it must
There is a digital transformation policy within the IES, as a vital input and
guide to begin this transformation process.” Another expert pointed out that the
Digital strategy is an articulating element, “…The digital strategy positively influences
in digital transformation if it is thought of in an integral and holistic way within the
IES, and subsequently this strategy responds to the mission and vision of an IES
digitally transformed.”63
Digital expertise
Among the factors that were evaluated, this factor obtained the lowest consensus and a
high dispersion in responses. Which indicates that it is not an influential factor within
a digital transformation process.
One expert highlighted that “…digital expertise is valuable for adequate construction
and direction of the digital transformation, helps to avoid making the mistakes that
other institutions have experienced, however, if it is not available, it can be
acquire". On the other hand, another expert focused on the attitude with which the
digital transformation, “…Expertise helps face cultural change with confidence,
Its importance does not lie so much or in the ease of implementing digital solutions, but in
the attitude with which the process is approached.”
Regarding the capabilities and skills of the staff, one expert mentioned that “…The

Another expert pointed out “…if the personnel has capabilities and skills, they can be

in cost, but somehow effective.”
Organizational Flexibility
This factor, like the previous one, is among the factors with the least consensus among the
experts. Which indicates that it is not an influential factor within a process of
digital transformation.64 Factors that influence the digital transformation in the Institutions of
Higher education. National University of Colombia Bogotá Headquarters
An expert indicated that “…Digital transformation implies flexibility and a new
culture, since it requires a prior organizational transformation and adaptation to what
digital". Likewise, another expert mentioned that “…Public Education Institutions
Superior are hierarchical, rigid and inflexible organizations for the application of
digital strategies, which leads to slow and slow improvement and innovation processes.
complex.”
An expert emphasized that not only organizational flexibility is fundamental in the
digital transformation, complements it with the concept of organizational agility,
“…I would add agility to this factor, flexibility and agility.” Another expert highlighted against
organizational flexibility that “…Digital transformation is linked to philosophies
administrative techniques such as Lean Management and agile methodologies in which the
flexibility of organizations.
On the other hand, an expert indicated that HEIs are not flexible “…Public institutions
They are not (we are not) flexible. Even so, it is possible to generate communications and responses
agile, which is what is really important.”
Collaboration
This factor, among the factors that were evaluated, obtained an acceptable level of consensus and
the greatest dispersion of the responses, given the approach that each of the experts
adopted. This consensus may indicate that this factor has little influence within a process
of digital transformation.
Among the justifications given by the experts, one of them mentioned that the
Collaboration is not a factor, but an institutional value, “…This factor should be a
institutional value, which must be given in all areas of the HEIs, for this they must
break the barriers s that exist in the dependencies so that the process of
digital transformation can occur.” On the other hand, an expert highlighted that “…The
Collaboration must be focused and articulated to the digital strategy to satisfy the
needs of its users. Another expert focused on the IT area, “…El65
IT department must transition from being a support process and become one
strategic. More than collaboration, we must talk about an integration and holistic view
of the organization.”
Customer orientation
This factor obtains a high level of consensus. Which indicates that it is a factor that influences
in digital transformation.
Regarding this factor, an expert considered that it is not a factor that influences the
digital transformation, he highlights that “… the public university market is
captive, so they do not need to compete as hard and therefore I do not consider it to have an influence. Without

"expects better service from the University itself."
On the other hand, some experts indicated their opinions regarding the types of client, a
expert mentioned “…In a public HEI it is necessary to define who the client is and what

These are of two types: internal and external, the first are the same collaborators and
workers, the latter, it is important to add value to them and for them to perceive the improvements in
processes, procedures and provision of services.” Along these same lines, another expert highlighted
that “…the client, regardless of whether they are internal or external, must benefit from the
transformation".
Finally, one expert indicated that “…anticipate the needs of students,
teachers and researchers should be the challenge of each agency. Anticipate in
instead of reacting to problems.”66 Factors that influence digital transformation in Information Institutions

4.3 Development of the second round
The second round (R2), and following the Delphi method, aimed to reach the
consensus of expert opinions (Zapata & Ebrero, 2010) on the factors
that influence the digital transformation of public Education Institutions
Superior. To do this, a second questionnaire was developed, which was presented to each
expert the response he reported against each factor that was evaluated in the first round
(R1) and was asked to confirm or modify that answer. I also know
provided the analysis that was carried out based on the justification of the responses of the
experts, for each factor evaluated.
Likewise, all factors were evaluated again in the second gives round, although in the
first round would have obtained a high level of consensus, such is the case of the factors:
Organizational culture, Resistance to change, Leadership, Customer Orientation and
Digital Strategy, table 4-3. Additionally, the 5 new factors were included
proposed by the experts in that first round: Context, Change management,
Technological infrastructure, business architecture and innovation with their respective
description.
The 10 experts who responded to the first round questionnaire were sent a
email where they were requested to participate in the completion of the
second round questionnaire. The access link to it was included there through
from the Google Forms application. These 10 experts answered the entire
questionnaire. The results of the second round are presented in table 4-5.67

of the experts.
Of the 6 factors and 2 subfactors that were identified in the first round and were

experts (minus the Collaboration factor), which may indicate that these factors influence

According to experts, it is a factor that has little influence on a transformation process

Regarding the justification of the 5 new factors that were identified in the first
round, the experts mentioned the following:
Context Factor
This factor obtained an acceptable consensus among the experts and a high dispersion of its results.
responses (S=1.2). Some experts mentioned that it is a factor that can lead to
influence the digital transformation, but not be relevant and that the context can motivate the
need to adopt or develop new technologies within said transformation.
In this sense, several experts highlighted that this factor influences the transformation
digital, which mention: “…Public HEIs present very diverse contexts in
where cultures and different ways of thinking come together, which influences the
digital transformation” and “…The University as an organization is not an isolated entity and
requires interaction with its environment, as established by the General Theory of
Systems and the theory of organizational ecology, the sector generates a synergy with the
organization".
An expert pointed out that this factor influences digital transformation, “…The context has
a high influence on the digital transformation of HEIs, because the latter

You can see how the pandemic forced HEIs to rethink themselves immediately and

On the other hand, another expert highlighted that the characteristics of the sector can make it difficult to

this sector are often not articulated and are far from the dynamics typical of some
of organizations in the sector. That dispersed and isolated vision along with the lack of69
integrated and interoperable mechanisms can make it difficult to carry out
“effective the digital transformation process.”
In the description of this factor it was mentioned “…Aspects such as the accreditation of the CNA
or public sector regulations, are obstacles to overcome in a process of
digital transformation”. Regarding this, several experts considered that this factor
little influences the digital transformation and they highlighted the following: “…The processes of
quality have indicators other than those of efficiency and effectiveness inherent to the
digital transformation”. “…Good practices are not obstacles to carrying out a
digital transformation process, this would help in methods and procedures to
adopt a better digital strategy.”
Change Management Factor
This factor obtained an acceptable consensus among the experts and the greatest dispersion of the
responses among all the factors that were evaluated (S=1.4). This was evident in the
justifications given by the experts, who focused mainly on aspects
how to handle transformation that of people, the IT area and the use of technologies.
Thus, two experts mentioned that the change management factor is not a factor but a
tool, “…Since resistance to change was already included as a factor, I consider
which is not an independent factor but a tool to resolve the influence
negative that resistance can bring” and “…A change management plan allows
facilitate assimilation within the organization and thus generate a better adaptation
simple".
Another expert highlighted that this factor is closely associated with IT management, “…This factor
affects the IT Management processes of organizations, because it relates the
importance of analyzing the risks, those responsible and the impacts of a change at the IT level.
However, at the University, this process is not so strict, because the
IT changes without the planning and analysis that should compromise a strict process70 Factors that influence digital transformation in IT Institutions
Higher education. National University of Colombia Bogotá Headquarters
of change management”. Another expert highlighted that the change management factor involves
people and processes, “…Change management not only involves "modifying or
adapt" the use of technologies within the organization, also involves the
people and processes, which will be impacted during the adoption of said
technologies, which is why it is necessary to apply adequate management of that stage of
transition involving all interested parties.”
Faced with this factor and the implementation of technologies, an expert pointed out that “…Although
Digital transformation is an organizational transformation, its success is based on the
implementation of correctly managed technologies.” Also another expert
highlighted that “…Our HEIs are conservative and the majority of its members are
formed in a period where others had to adjust to the demands of the one who has the
control. For this reason, without change management towards a service and
collaboration, digital transformation may be affected.”
Technological infrastructure factor
This factor obtained an acceptable consensus among the experts and a high dispersion of the
responses, among all the factors that were evaluated, (S=0.8). This was evident in the
justifications given by experts.
One expert mentioned that technological infrastructure is not a relevant factor in the
digital transformation, he considers that it is an important but not sufficient condition:
“…Infrastructure is important for the institution. However, the transformation
“Digital is more of a culture of service and collaboration than of device use.” For him
On the contrary, one expert considered that “…innovations in infrastructure such as
cloud, can alone motivate transformation.” Likewise, another expert stated
“…It is important to have the appropriate resources and infrastructure that supports the
pro transformation process. Otherwise it will not be possible to respond to the parties
interested and involved.”
On the other hand, an expert highlighted that it must be taken into account that “…infrastructure is
very diverse in our country and by region there is a different reality, in the case of71
These HEIs are located in remote regions that have notable difficulties.” In
Along the same lines, an expert emphasized that this factor “…Allows establishing strategies of
appropriation, as well as estimating costs.”
Enterprise Architecture Factor
This factor, which was evaluated in the second round, obtained a high level of consensus among the
experts, which is why it can be considered an influential factor in digital transformation
in public HEIs.
This is how an expert mentioned, regarding this factor, that “…HEIs usually have a
conventional organizational model that has evolved little in the last 100 years and
that it is time to imagine new HEIs from scratch.” Also, another expert considered that the
enterprise architecture facilitates decision making “…Enterprise architecture gives
the north and the focus in an articulated and integrated manner, which facilitates decision making
and the definition of appropriate strategies to carry out the changes in the different
domains: processes, information systems and technological infrastructure”.
Another expert highlighted that at the National University of Colombia in particular there is no
a business architecture, “...In the University there is no defined
enterprise architecture, there are defined quality processes (although they are not
articulated), strategies that are not always applied at the national level and the technology is
dispersed, which means that this business architecture map is not defined at the level
national and does not influence decisions on digital transformation at the University.”
For his part, another expert pointed out that enterprise architecture is a tool
“…Enterprise architecture is a tool, and also necessary in a process of
successful technological transformation, but I do not consider that it is the tool that
influences the transformation.” However, they also mentioned that as a tool
allows “…orchestrate the elements involved in this transformation.”72 Factors that influence the digital transformation in the Institutions of
Higher education. National University of Colombia Bogotá Headquarters
On the other hand, one expert indicated that, “…even though enterprise architecture is
key within the digital transformation, it is not the center of it.”
Innovation Factor
This factor obtained an acceptable consensus (RIR = 0.3) among the experts and one of the
greater dispersions of responses among all the factors that were evaluated
(S=1,2).
Thus, an expert mentioned that “…innovation helps in improvement and change
organizational within a digital transformation process, as long as it is
planned, coordinated and organized.” Another expert also highlighted that the novation is
a driving element of digital transformation “…Innovation is a principle,
potentially presedimenting within an organization, which motivates to think and
do things differently to achieve objectives that benefit it. In that
sense, I think that it clearly influences, perhaps as the element that drives, a
digital transformation”.
Likewise, another expert highlighted that “…digital transformation must allow HEIs
respond very quickly to the demands of a changing market, and in
some cases unpredictable, therefore, it is important to consider innovation as
key piece to survive in the market and contribute significantly to said
transformation". Along the same lines, an expert mentioned that “…A culture of
Innovation in HEI is essential to imagine services that make life easier and
enable the development of the agents that comprise it.”
On the other hand, an expert points out that innovation is not a factor that influences
digital transformation “…innovation is not a factor that influences the transformation
digital, but it is a part of said transformation.”73

stability is that the variation must be between ± 2, that is, in the interval (-2 ≤ Vr ≤ 2).
It is observed that of the 6 factors and 2 subfactors that were identified in the review of the
literature, 6 do not present significant variation between the two successive rounds:

During the two rounds they obtain a high level of consensus. According to experts, they are
considered the most influential factors in digital transformation in Institutions
Public Higher Education.
The factors Digital Expertise and Organizational Flexibility, which in the first round
obtained an acceptable level of consensus, for the second round they reached a level of
high consensus, which may indicate that these two factors can also influence the
digital transformation. On the other hand, the Collaboration factor, in both rounds obtained a
acceptable level of consensus, which may indicate, according to experts, that this factor
little influence on digital transformation.
Regarding the factors that the experts identified in the first round and that were
evaluated in the second round, the Business Architecture factor obtained a level of
high consensus, which indicates that it is a factor that also influences the transformation

In HEIs, authors such as Eradze et al. (2019) and Morales et al. (2021) state that
Situations such as a pandemic could be a factor that influences and accelerates a process of
digital transformation in an HEI, leading to fundamental changes in the
teaching, evolving towards an online teaching-learning scenario.
This new factor opens new research on digital transformation issues given the
recent and new change for higher education caused by the pandemic.
The pandemic generated a sudden and forced closure of in-person teaching, leading to
teachers and students to “unknown terrain” due to the need to adapt
rapidly to digital learning environments, called “online education of
emergency". This abrupt change has forced universities to evolve towards
online teaching in record time, implementing and adapting resources

They lack technological capabilities for online teaching (Morales et al., 2021).
The transition from in-person education to virtual education will have implications
significant for the entire learning process, it will not only modify the methods to
evaluate learning outcomes, but will also require review of the
skills and comp skills required of students in this new environment.
Likewise, there must be adequate infrastructure and technological platforms.

5. Conclusions and recommendations
In this chapter, the results of the research are presented, in summary,
from the question and its objectives, developed through multimethodology
by Mingers (2003) and the case study by Yin (2003).
5.1 Conclusions
The general objective of this research work is to identify the factors
that influence the digital transformation in Higher Education Institutions, and
Three specific objectives emerge from this. For its development, the
Multimethodology proposed by Mingers, the case study designed by Yin and the method
Delphi.
For the development of objective no.1, a systematic review of the literature on
the term digital transformation. The databases yielded results associated with
This is mainly in the industrial sector, this allowed us to identify definitions,
impacts, challenges and mainly the factors that influence a process of
digital transformation. The review of the literature in relation to Institutions of
Higher Education, some universities were identified that have implemented
strategies and new processes with the introduction of technologies as part of their
digital transformation process.
Regarding the factors that influence digital transformation, six were identified:
Organizational culture, Customer orientation, Digital strategy, Collaboration, Expertise
digital and organizational flexibility; and 2 subfactors: Resistance to change and Leadership79
(which are part of the organizational culture factor). It should be noted that in the case of
Institutions of Higher Education was not clearly evidenced, in the literature, the
factors that can influence a digital transformation process.
For the specific objective no. 2 the factors that were identified in the objective were taken
no.1 and the characterization of each of them was carried out. For this was taken into account
the features and specifications mentioned by the authors in each article
analyzed.
Finally, for objective no.3, the factors that were identified and
characterized in the previous objectives, through experts who are part of the
National University of Colombia Bogotá Headquarters. In order to achieve the objective,
developed a questionnaire that is part of the first round of the Delphi method, which
It contained the 6 factors and 2 subfactors identified and which were subjected to evaluation
by the selected experts. As a result of this first round, the experts
included 5 new factors: Context, Business Architecture, Innovation, Product Management
change and technological infrastructure.

Once the two rounds of evaluation with experts have been applied, the factors that
obtained greater consensus and were defined as the factors that most influence the
digital transformation in a Public Institution of Higher Education are the
following, in order of consensus, table 5-2.80 Factors that influence the digital transformation in the Institutions of
Higher education. National University of Colombia Bogotá Headquarters
Table 5-2 Factors that influence a digital transformation in an HEI
Factor Level of Influence
Organizational culture Very influential
Resistance to change Very influential
Very influential leadership
Customer focus Very influential
Digital strategy Very influential
Digital expertise Very influential
Organizational flexibility Very influential
Enterprise architecture Very influential
Collaboration Not very influential
Context Not very influential
Innovation Little influential
Change management Not very influential
Technological infrastructure Little influential
The identification of these factors provides an answer to those responsible for the
implementation of digital transformation. As mentioned by Hess et al. (2016), the
Most of those responsible for this transformation lack clarity about the
different options and elements that must be considered, as a consequence, run the
risk of not considering important elements or ignoring solutions that are more
favorable for a specific situation of the organization.
As a result of the evaluation by experts, it can be concluded that the factors
identified in the research are applicable to a digital transformation process in
a Higher Education Institution, in this case a public HEI.
Finally, a factor that can influence a digital transformation process and that
can make it worse are exceptional situations like a pandemic, since like
It happened in 2020, in a few weeks changes were necessary in the sector
educational, especially in HEIs, from a face-to-face teaching process to one of type81
virtual, mobilizing the entire organization to a new educational and organizational process
with the support of its technological infrastructure.
5.2 Recommendations
This research was carried out to respond to the need of how to start a
digital transformation process in a Higher Education Institution (IES),
identifying the factors that influence this transformation.
Although this research has as a case study the National University of
Colombia Headquarters Bogotá, for future studies it is proposed to apply the Delphi method and the
associated questionnaires for the other campuses of the university and thus confirm the
factors that can influence digital transformation in a public HEI. even count
with greater participation of experts, not only belonging to an HEI but also
external experts who are working on this topic in the educational sector. This
will allow us to deepen and consolidate these factors and the identification of new factors.
On the other hand, at the end of the application of the Delphi methodology the researcher had
access to information on the process that is being carried out of digital transformation in
the National University of Colombia, in which they identified 11 factors of change
(described in section 2.7.1), for this reason these factors were not taken into account.
account in the present research, which provides an opportunity for future
investigations that allow contrasting the factors that have been identified in this
institution and the results of this investigation and that can influence said
Transformation proccess.
In the medium term, it is proposed to apply the proposed questionnaires under the Delphi method.
in private and official Higher Education Institutions to contrast the factors
identified that influence digital transformation and thus obtain a general overview
in the Colombian context.82 Factors that influence the digital transformation in the Institutions of
Higher education. National University of Colombia Bogotá Headquarters
Also, it is proposed to investigate how exceptional situations such as a pandemic and in
especially the one caused by covid-19 could influence a digital transformation process
in an HEI.
Finally, in the long term it is proposed, with these identified factors and other factors
that identify with experts, a model for adopting digital transformation in HEIs
that allows evaluating these factors.83

Abstract
Digital Transformation in Higher Education Institutions. Implementation Model
Higher Education Institutions have been permeated, on the one hand, to the technological
advance that brings with it the fourth industrial revolution, on the other hand, to compliance
with regulations embodied in State/Nation policies, and solutions/services required by
external situations so powerful as the Covid-19 pandemic that have forced Higher
Education Institutions to face a digital transformation in all its dimensions. Although the
growing interest in the area is evident from the literature, there is still little research carried
out in this regard in the higher education sector. It is necessary to elucidate the way of
applying digital transformation approaches to the Higher Education Institutions domain as
an emerging field that has aroused interest in the recent past, developing an
implementation model that allows describing complex relationships between dimensions
involved in an educational domain with technological support. It is necessary to carry out
empirical studies on the nature of the interrelationships between the dimensions involved
(organizational, sociocultural, and technological) and their effect on the level of maturity of
the digital transformation of Higher Education Institutions. It is for this reason that this
research aims to address this gap by creating an implementation model that allows
describing complex relationships between dimensions and facilitates the understanding
and implementation of digital transformation in Higher Education Institutions. To achieve
this objective, a systematic literature review (RSL) is carried out to facilitates the
identification of the dimensions involved in the digital transformation processes and their
main characteristics. Subsequently, a digital transformation at HEIs measurement
instrument is created, and through the Delphi Method, 9 expert judges validate its content.
Finally, the structural equations model theory was used to check the validity and adjust the
proposed implementation model. One of the main contributions of this work lies in theXII Transformación Digital en las IES. Modelo de implementación
confirmation of a model that integrates the relationship between a set of variables
(Organizational, Sociocultural and Technological) that positively influences the Maturity of

Digital transformation has become a priority for educational institutions
superior in this second decade of the 21st century given that this is a natural process and
necessary for organizations that claim to be leaders of change and highly
competitive in their domain. Furthermore, today's societies face challenges and
complex changes that can only be addressed and resolved only by grouping the
expert knowledge and finding responsible solutions (Stolze et al., 2018). Several
Authors have defined digital transformation from the field of business. Among them,
Hess et al. (2016) who express that digital transformation is concerned with changes
that digital technologies can cause in a company's business model, and
resulting in modified products or organizational structures, or automation
of processes. From the vision of higher education institutions, the transformation
Digital is the process of technological and organizational change induced in them by the
development of digital technologies (Almaraz et al., 2013). Consequently, the
Higher education institutions face a disruptive scenario that is
establishes new business models, transforming the way they evolve in
over time, actively linking internal and external clients, increasing your
commitment and strengthening their experience in the organization. This change is called
digital transformation (Arango Serna et al., 2019).
On the other hand, higher education institutions are also influenced and
conditioned by the policies of the Nation-State, by the global trends of the system
capitalist world, due to events such as the one that occurred due to the Covid-19 pandemic, which are
much more powerful than the changes and transformations that the institutions of
higher education can produce within themselves and in the society where they reside
(López Segrera, 2008). According to Wrana María Pazzinni, cited by (Barcos, 2008), for her
transformation, the university must meet global demands, increase the number2 Digital Transformation in HEIs. Deployment model
of quotas, improve quality, promote research, optimize extension, promote
leadership, provide lifelong educational services, focus on learning
and skills training, redefining its mission and, above all, the dynamics of
relationships and the speed of information, they must have management structures and systems
of information to make transparent, agile and effective decisions and for a process
continuous and careful evaluation capable of measuring the objectives that are achieved.
For its part, Kuzu (2020) expresses that digital transformation occurs to determine the
needs and behaviors of stakeholders, and provide education,
research and social services in accordance with the demands of
users/beneficiaries who take advantage of the services in a competition in an environment
changing. This means digitization of basic services, academics, students with
advanced digital capabilities, and decision support systems that can
adapt to circumstances. It is crucial that each university develops its own
digital transformation strategy, to achieve this goal they must evaluate the potential of
digital teaching and learning offerings for their institutions, and take them
decisions about which ones to use based on your individual profiles, budgets and
specific objectives. Furthermore, this will require partners and close cooperation with the
government, the business sector and civil society (Dräger et al., 2014).
However, even though the concept of digital transformation has gained importance
Within the academic community, there is still a lack of consensus on the
implementation around digital transformation in educational institutions
higher, on which components are relevant, which architectures are the most
appropriate to develop digital transformation in educational institutions
superior. This interest has been increasing since the beginning of the pandemic, as
Garner (2023) describes, in 2020 the HEIs rapidly promoted processes
of digital transformation, then in 2021 they were forced to venture into
blended-learning/e-learning methodologies, and in 2022, interest in
improve and/or sustain these changes over time (Garner, 2023). At the end of the road, no
There is an implementation model that facilitates the understanding of the transformation
digital in higher education institutions in Colombia.
Added to the above, it has been possible to identify that the basis of the literature of the
Digital transformation in Latin American universities is still limited with respect to Introduction 3
to empirical studies (IDC infodoc, 2019; Ara ngo Serna et al., 2019; Castro Benavides
et al., 2021a, 2021b; Ramírez Montoya, 2020; Rodriguez-Abitia & Bribiesca-Correa, 2019).
Additional efforts are required to gain a better understanding of how
integrate and complement the dimensions involved in transformation processes and
how to improve the maturity levels of the digital transformation of institutions
of higher education (Castro Benavides et al., 2020; Fernández et al., 2023).
Consequently, and taking into account the knowledge gap identified, the
research aims to design an implementation model that explains, and
guide digital transformation in public higher education institutions in
Colombia. The novelty of this work is in proposing a holistic model of
digital transformation that, seen as an organizational transformation, relates the
organizational, socio-cultural and technological perspectives within the institutions of
higher education reflected in their level of maturity. As part of this objective,
will explore the interrelationships between the perspectives considered and their effect on the
maturity levels of digital transformation in higher education institutions.
This phase of the study is considered original, both for the creation of the instrument of
measurement of digital transformation in higher education institutions, as well as
for its content validation process by experts, absent in the literature.

perspectives: (1) Technological – digital transformation is based on the use of new
digital technologies such as social networks, mobile devices, analytics or devices
integrated; (2) Organizational – digital transformation requires a change in processes
organizational or the creation of new business models; and (3) Social – the
digital transformation is a phenomenon that is influencing all aspects of life
human, for example, improving the customer experience (Reis et al., 2018). This reality
makes there different definitions and appropriations of digital transformation
Authors such as (Reis et al., 2018) express that digital transformation is the use of new
digital technologies that enable significant business improvements and influence all
aspects of clients' lives. For Schwab (2016), digital transformation is the
result of organizational change where people, processes and the business model
business, they understand technology as a tool to generate value among their
consumers and collaborators. Likewise, Wade (2015) points out Digital Transformation in HEIs as an imperative6. Deployment model
and has led organizations to rethink how they can use technology to improve
their performance or expand their businesses. Digital transformation is all about
fundamentally with change and involves people, processes, strategies, structures
and competitive dynamics. Authors such as Solis et al. (2014) consider that the
Digital transformation involves realignment or new investment in technology and models
commercials to more effectively engage digital customers at each point
of contact in the life cycle of the customer experience. Companies should think
in digital transformation as a "formal effort to renew the vision, models
and commercial investments for a new digital economy." For his part, Gobble
(2018), specifies it as “The profound transformation of activities, processes,
competencies and business and organizational models to take full advantage of the
changes and opportunities from a combination of digital technologies and their accelerated
impact on society in a strategic and prioritized way.”
From a general perspective, as can be deduced from the definitions
given by the authors, digital transformation is a complex problem that affects
many or all segments within a company. Managers must balance
simultaneously the exploration and exploitation of the resources of their companies to
achieving organizational agility, a necessary condition for successful transformation
of their businesses (T Hess et al., 2016). In response to the problem, the institutions of
Higher education are not immune to this imperative change, as concluded by Faria &
Nóvoa (2017), saying that this transformation pre-establishes that “taking advantage of
efficiently all the opportunities and potential offered by the large number of
digital technologies available, completely redefine business models in
The entire value chain is not simple and, of course, it is a complex task. This challenge
is more pressing for organizations that are constantly trying to ensure their
competitive position in a global market, but the same worry is becoming
relevant to universities, as competition to select
to the best students and researchers. Aligned with this scenario, López Segrera
(2008) states that “Higher education institutions are influenced and
conditioned by the policies of the Nation-State and by the global trends of the
capitalist world-system. It seems that these influences on the University are
much more powerful than the changes and transformations that can be produced by
higher education institutions within themselves and in the society where they reside”Chapter 1. Research Design 7
(p.271). And universities compete globally for students, academics and
financing funds, and only those that remain relevant and take advantage of the
new digital capabilities will benefit in this digital era (PwC, 2018). As well as
many companies, higher education institutions, have responded to the impact of
digitalization through multiple, separate and uncoordinated initiatives. As
Consequently, they run the risk of not considering important elements of the
digital transformation or ignore solutions that are more favorable for situations
specific, which could have unintended adverse consequences (T Hess et al.,
2016).
In addition to the above, as a result of the rapid pace of technological change and the
ubiquitous technologies that emerge almost daily, there is no "one size fits all" solution.
everyone" that supports effective digital transformation in organizations (Carcary et al.,
2002). The challenge is exacerbated by the fact that digital transformation
organizational covers the entire scope of the organization and requires a rethinking
completeness of skill sets and investment strategy (Olanrewaju et al.,
2014).
Faced with this scenario, higher education institutions are called to
face a digital transformation seen as an organic metamorphosis and
structural that will have to be adapted over time, making use of the
the institution's own resources, making the most of human resources and the environment
that surrounds it, to guarantee its survival (Arango Serna et al., 2019).
1.2 Systematic Literature Review
To clarify the existing knowledge gap, this section presents a review
systematic literature, following the PRISMA protocol, to show that it is
a complete, objective and reliable description, and not a partial review of a sample
for convenience (Castro Benavides et al., 2020).
The following section describes conducting a systematic literature review.
proposal:8 Digital Transformation in HEIs. Deployment model
1.2.1 Objectives of the RSL
The objective of this systematic review of the literature is to determine the dimensions, the
actors and implementations that have taken place in the process of tr digital transformation
within higher education institutions. To this end, the systematic review
translates the research objective into the following main research questions
(RQ):
Question structure
As requested in (Shamseer et al., 2015), the questions that the review will address with
reference to PICO, are:
RQ1. How is the digital transformation reflected in higher education institutions in

Digital transformation has become relevant within organizations, without
However, it is desirable to explore what is meant by digital transformation, its scope and
implications within higher education institutions.
This research question has been mapped into the following questions.
MQ1.1. What definitions of digital transformation are established in the literature and
Do they apply to higher education institutions?
MQ1.2. Who have been the main researchers in digital transformation in
higher education institutions?
MQ1.3. How has research on digital transformation evolved in the
higher education institutions over time? It is required taking into account
the dates, the number of publications and the countries.
RQ2. How has digital transformation been addressed in educational institutions

dimensions, it is required within the context to identify them, highlight their characteristics,
relationships and contribution to the consolidation of digital transformation within the
higher education institutions. Likewise, it is important to identify who are the Chapter 1. Research Design 9
main actors involved and what have been the most common errors that prevent
the progress of a digitalization process.
This research question has been mapped into the following questions:
MQ2.1. What are the main dimensions involved in digital transformation
of higher education institutions?
MQ2.2. How are the dimensions of the digital transformation of companies interrelated?

1.2.2 Methods
Next, the methods applied in this research will be described:
▪ Eligibility criteria
The studies will be selected according to the criteria detailed below.
continuation:
Study designs: studies are included where it is possible to identify which dimensions of
Higher education institutions have been permeated by digital transformation,
who has intervened in these processes, their methodology, the technologies adopted, among
others.
Taking into account the suggestion given by Kitchenham & Ebse (2007) using criteria
PICO, to identify keywords and search strings defined from
Research questions. The following is considered:
Population (P): Higher education institutions, their actors and interested parties.
Intervention (I): Studies of interest to researchers on the
digital transformation and its implementations, components, technologies, etc.10 Digital Transformation in HEIs. Deployment model
Comparison (C): In this study no intervention of
comparison.
Results (O): Proposals associated with the implementation of digital transformations
in higher education institutions.
Time: All studies that were published between 1980 and April 2019 will be selected
for inclusion, because the year 1983 is considered a starting point that recognizes
the birth of the Internet as one of the foundations of digital transformation.
Configuration: there will be restrictions by document type, articles and minutes will be analyzed
of congresses
Language: We will include articles reported in English to avoid bias, recognizing this
language as the universal language.
▪ Sources of information
The search was carried out through the electronic databases Web of Science and
Scopus, since they are the most relevant scientific information platforms that access
to scientific databases and the most significant publications of the different
areas of knowledge. In particular, on digital transformation issues in
higher education institutions.
Both databases allow searching for advanced structures using operators
logical ones that conform to the specifications of the systematic review proposed in this
investigation. As well as the filtration and bibliometric analysis tools that provide
valuable information for the proposed systematic review. Furthermore, the University
National and the University of Quindío have access to these available databases
for their students and researchers.
▪ Search strategies
One of the most subtle but relevant moments of an SLR is the shooting strategy.
structured search, since it must allow the filtering of the information available in the
databases, so that the selected articles answer the questions
raised in the investigation and, consequently, the declared objective is met. TheChapter 1. Research Design 11
search strategy should allow evaluation of the completeness of the search (Kitchenham et
al., 2009).
In response to this requirement, the words contained in the search strategy
identify the keywords considered in the PICO model and also the questions of
investigation.
o Identification
The structured search that was used to find the articles was:
("Digital transformation*") AND ("Higher Education Institution*" OR Universit*).
The search string adapted to the syntax required by the Institute's databases of Scientific Information - Web of Science is as follows:

It is necessary to clarify that 119 records were identified through the database search
of data, and the search in the databases was carried out on April 10, 2019.
▪ Study Record
o Data management
A set of software tools was used to manage the data and analyze the
article information, Mendeley and Microsoft Excel.
Mendeley was used to perform two tasks basically. First, it was to manage the
articles resulting from the search in scientific databases and eliminate references
duplicates. Second, classify the information of each article, underlining with a color
different depending on the category. On the other hand, to document and manage data
resulting from the following PRISMA protocol Excel was used. Made it easy to follow the diagram
flow once the selection process is completed. The work book is composed
through several tabs, where each phase was documented in them. All information is

▪ Selection Process
o Search (Screening): Inclusion/exclusion criteria: For the present study,
The following inclusion/exclusion criteria of articles are taken into account
found.Chapter 1. Research Design 13
Duplicate references will be removed using the Mendeley tool, used for
information management, subsequent analysis, purification and classification of articles. With
this tool, all duplicate references were removed. So the articles

The title and summary of the resulting works are analyzed and the following are applied
inclusion criteria:
1. Articles include the sequence words "Digital Transformation" in their title
AND
2. The articles include in their abstract the sequence words “HEI or University”
The criterion was applied by reading the titles and abstracts of the downloaded studies to

word did not appear. In cases where the title and abstract were not sufficient to
make a decision, the entire content of the article is evaluated.
To classify whether a document met these criteria, the following was performed
logical operation.

very similar, from the same author.
In some cases, the keywords did not exactly match those described in the
inclusion/exclusion criteria. In this case, a careful reading of the text was carried out
to identify whether the authors had included synonyms or expressions that reflected the
digital transformation in higher education institutions. For example, digitization,
digital business model, business digital transformation, digital teaching. Those
Documents were included in the following stages to continue their analysis.
o Inclusion (Included): Quality evaluation criteria: One of the tasks
described as critical by Kitchenham et al. (2007), is the evaluation criterion
of quality and is therefore considered a challenge in a systematic review.
Furthermore, an initial difficulty is that there is no agreed definition of
"quality of l study. However, the CRD Guidelines and the Manual of the
Cochrane reviewers suggest that quality relates to the extent to which the
study minimizes bias and maximizes internal and external validity.
Researcher Wieringa et al. (2006) exposes some approaches to evaluation criteria,
For example, is the problem clearly stated? Are the properties causal or
clearly established problem logic? Is the research method sound? The
knowledge validation is validated? In other words, is the conclusion supported
for the document? Is this a significant increase in knowledge of these
situations? In other words, are the lessons learned interesting? There is
Enough discussion on related work?
For this purpose, Kitchenham et al., (2007) constructed a quality questionnaire
based on 5 questions that affect the quality of the study, and were scored to provide
a general measure of its quality. In this sense, the questions were adapted to the study
current, and the following questions are relevant to the extent that they define the
inclusion/exclusion of articles for complete reading and subsequent analysis. That is, instead

▪ Data collection process
At this stage of the systematic review, the qualitative analysis of the information that
allowed us to answer each of the questions established in Section 1.2.1.18 Digital Transformation in HEIs. Deployment model
This data collection process was developed in 3 stages.
1. Analysis of the information: As the article was read, the text fragments that
answer the questions in Section 1.2.1 were highlighted with different colors,
using the Mendeley tool. This action allowed for greater reading, analysis and
detailed classification.
2. Classification of information: Label codes were defined to assign a
representative meaning to the highlighted information.
3. Information Extraction: Each of the fragments of highlighted text on stage
1 was classified according to the codes established in stage 2. A sheet was required
calculation to manage the information resulting from this stage.

fundamentally about change and it involves people, processes, strategies, structures, and competitive
dynamics. (Wade, 2015)
Digital transformation implies an organizational change based on the use and convergence of several
resources and advances of emerging technologies, such as big data, cloud computing, artificial intelligence,
augmented and virtual reality, mobile apps, social media, internet of things, blockchains, among others.
(Rodrigues, 2017)

(Betchoo, 2016) Digital transformation is described as the profound and accelerating transformation of business activities,
processes, competencies and models to fully leverage the changes and opportunities of digital technologies
and their impact across society in a strategic and prioritized way (i-scoop, 2015).

Digital Transformation as a “formal effort to renovate business vision, models, and investments for a new
digital economy. (Solis et al., 2014).
Digital transformation as the practice which closes the gap between what digital customers already expect
and what analogue businesses actually deliver (Verdino, 2015).
(J A Faria & According to Bharadwaj et al. (2013), the idea behind digital transformation and a digital business strategy
Nóvoa, 2017) is simply that of an organizational strategy formulated and executed by leveraging digital resources to create
additional and differentiated value.
Digital transformation strategy impacts a company more comprehensively than an IT strategy, by
addressing potential effects on interactions across company borders with clients, competitors and suppliers
(Matt et al., 2015).20 Transformación Digital en las IES. Modelo de implementación
Digital transformation goes well beyond de-materialization of processes, encompassing an innovative use
of new technologies (cloud, social, mobile and an alytics) as a way to promote new services, re-define
business models and innovative interactions with its users (J A Faria & Nóvoa, 2017).
(Kaminskyi et al., The widespread proliferation of digital technologies, their penetration into basically all spheres of human life
2018) and society is reflected in the concept of digital transformation.
Digital transformation determines the transition to a massive use of digital technologies in the variety of
sectors of the economy and society, which improve or replace traditional products and services.
Digital transformation of the university education system should have a broader focus and has to include
the modernization of corporate IT architecture management, which could provide an important contribution
to structuring the efforts of innovation in education. (Kaminskyi et al., 2018)
(Fleacă, 2017) The author considered the modern developments in the area of modernizing educational system with the
aid of ITC technology and applied process thinking principles in the attempt to capture and model
interrelated activities required to integrate digital technologies in teaching, learning and organizational
practices. (Fleacă, 2017)
(Stolze et al., A major challenge faced by organizations today is how to adopt and leverage new digital technologies, as
2018) the ability to promote digital transformation is in large part determined by a clear digital strategy enabled by
a culture of change, risk-taking and innovation, supported by its leaders. The path to digitalization requires
organizations to embrace a digital mindset, as new digital technologies demand different mindsets and skill-
sets than previous waves of transformative technologies (Fitzgerald et al., 2013) (Kaufman and Horton,
2014; Kane et al., 2015).
(Bresinsky & Von Two different but interdependent developments can be identified: on the one hand innovations in digital
Reusner, 2018) technologies drive the need for transformation and adaption in organizations, but on the other hand digital
innovation is also shaped by the changing demands and requirements of users implementing these
innovations. Thus, to understand the impact it is necessary to address both sides of digital transformation,
new technologies and tools as well as changing user requirements through digital innovations. (Bresinsky
& Von Reusner, 2018)
Digitized organizations need to focus on both technology domain and social domain for a successful
transformation. (Bresinsky & Von Reusner, 2018)
(Pérez Gama, Digital Transformation seeks to significantly improve the productivity, competitiveness, and quality of
2019) Postsecondary Education institutions. Digital Transformation is an accelerated evolution. It is also revolution
because of its radical and structural implications for people as for infrastructure that also requires new
educational and business models.
(Grab et al., (Grab et al., 2019) syntheses that digital transformation consists of a wide-range of different components
2019) ac ross such diverse disciplines like computer science, social science, energy management and many more.
At this point, firms around the globe predominantly center on dealing with the latest technological
advancements. Those include the use of artificial intelligence, internet of things, cloud computing or social
media. The multitude and complexity of different topics under the umbrella of digital transformation poses a
particular challenge for firms seeking to piggy-back on the latest trends. On the one hand, firms aim to profit
from a changing market environment influenced by such mega trends, on the other hand digital
transformation has the power to fundamentally change entire industries and organizations.
(Thoring et al., Innovative digital concepts for teaching have the potential to substantially change the way courses of studies
2018) are formed because they allow for considerably more differentiation. In an extreme case, a student could
completely personalize his course of studies based on modularized teaching content. (Shaheen & Khatoon,
2017).
(G Sandhu, 2018) Digital business transformation can be defined as the modification of business processes, procedures,
capabilities and policies to take advantage of the changes and opportunities presented by new digital
technologies, as well as the impact they have on society, while always thinking about current and future
trends.Capítulo 1. Diseño de la Investigación 21

digital transformation in higher education institutions from the perspectives
technological, organizational and social. However, the emphasis on his interest and study has
evolved over time. This is what the great interest looked like from the perspective
technology during 2017, where the percentage of articles that addressed the
digital transformation in higher education institutions from that perspective was of the
67%. In 2018, interest in research increases from social and
organizational, going from 17% in 2017 to 39% in 2018. At this time, in the year
2019, the trend for the social perspective denotes great importance and interest that
covers 57% of the articles analyzed, and 29% of the research was dedicated to
the organizational perspective, leaving last the technological perspective with the

learning, professional development, assessment practices, content and curricula,
collaboration and networking, and infrastructure. (Kampylis et al., 2015)
Transformation Transformation in higher education institutions is becoming an issue
of the common process at the business level. Large and medium-sized companies under the transformation of the
business are making fundamental changes that involve multiple dimensions, including
there are business processes (Muzyka et al., 1995). Transform a traditional business

Although technology development can be outsourced, the process must be
mainly internal. The changes, which are mainly in the business process,
They induce changes in other processes, strategies and in the company as a whole. (Krell &
Gale, 2005).
Infrastructure It is clear that digital transformation in higher education institutions is not focused
exclusively in the technological infrastructure, but it becomes a vital support for
his achievement. Digital transformation in higher education institutions is supported
by an adequate IT infrastructure to meet the requirements of the organization,
infrastructure that can help adopt effective policies and practices that support the
teaching, learning and administrative processes that arise in the digital age. A
Limited focus only on infrastructure negatively affects the implementation of
digital transformation, which addresses workplace infrastructure and IT and is
focuses on a common group infrastructure and common tools to communicate
and cooperate more efficiently (Singh & Hess, 2017).

Administration Digital transformation and digitization are similar terms that apply to
services, processes and organizational structures across IT/IS and based enablers
the Web; Therefore, the connection with the administration is so vital that companies
need to establish management practices to govern these complex
transformations (Matt et al., 2015).
Marketing Much of the competition takes place on the internet. Students search and find
alternative online offers. Options to continue your university studies outside of
your country or take them online at a prestigious university, but without leaving your home. The
Higher education is perceived as an investment or purchase that the student makes to
invest in a future and to have good job opportunities. The digital reputation, the
global presence of an institution on the Internet is increasingly important, and they do not coincide
exactly with the traditional reputation (Almaraz et al., 2013).
Information Today's organizations rely on their data assets to make better decisions
informed and more effective. These data in a context become information and, in
Consequently, they contribute to acquiring knowledge. Knowledge is information in
perspective, integrated into a point of view based on recognition and interpretation
of patterns. Knowledge is acquired when one understands the meaning of the
information. (Mosley et al., 2016).
Government agencies, educational institutions, and nonprofit organizations
For-profit organizations also need high-quality data to guide their operational activities,
tactical and strategic. Every company needs to effectively manage its
increasingly important data and information resources. Through an association of
business leadership and technical expertise, the data management function can
effectively provide and control data and information assets. The management of
Data is the business function of planning, controlling, and delivering data assets and

1.2.3 Discussion of the identified literature
This section discusses the results associated with the key questions of
research stated in Section 1.2.1, and their mapping questions.
▪ How is the digital transformation reflected in higher education institutions in the
literature? RQ1.
Digital transformation within higher education institutions has been addressed
from different perspectives. There were 13 articles that provide different
approaches and definitions related to digital transformation in institutions of Chapter 1. Research Design 33
higher education. Researchers Grab et al. (2019) present the transformation
digital as a disruptive element that fundamentally changes industries and
entire organizations. While researchers Bresinsky & Von Reusner (2018)
they recognize that Digitized organizations must focus both on the domain of
technology as well as in the social domain for a successful transformation. Furthermore, the
researchers Henriette et al. (2015), Betchoo (2016), Rodrigues (2017), Pérez Gama
(2019), G Sandhu (2018) consider digital transformation in educational institutions.
higher education from an aligned renewal business model perspective
with technological trends. Furthermore, researcher Rodrigues (2017) adds
elements involved in the digital transformation process such as people, processes,
competitive strategies, structures and dynamics. On the other hand, researchers C
Sullivan & Staib (2018), Kaminskyi et al. (2018) involve a social aspect that intervenes
in the digital transformation process, pointing the transformation towards the life cycle
of the customer experience and how digital transformation improves or replaces
traditional products and services. Furthermore, researchers J A Faria & Nóvoa (2017)
link digital transformation as a resource to create additional and differentiated value,
and also expand the spectrum of digital transformation in educational institutions
superior to interactions across company boundaries with customers, competitors
and suppliers. Likewise, Kaminskyi et al., (2018) introduce an organic structure, the
IT architecture management to structure innovation efforts in education.
The authors Fleacă (2017) and Thoring et al. (2018) observe the digital transformation from
the educational dimension that integrates digital technologies into teaching practices,
learning and organization. Finally, researchers Stolze et al. (2018) propose
challenges in the digital transformation culture of change, risk taking and innovation, with
the support of their leaders and training.
The following paragraphs give additional details on the transformation dimensions
digital in higher education institutions.
Teaching dimension: Digital transformation seen from the teaching dimension
It has several fronts of intervention, like this:
Digital platforms and content for teaching and learning: the authors Bozhko
et al. (2016) consider that it is important to use tools that satisfy the 34 Digital Transformation in HEIs. Deployment model
contemporary educational standards and methods, such as tools based on
digital technology (Henriette et al., 2015). In line with the authors Wildan Zulfikar et al.
(2018) who consider appropriate the nature of the platform that allows users
students study at their own pace; complete the curriculum without being restricted
for a while. One of the requirements to use these platforms is the digitization of the
learning resources, as well as the inclusion of introductory training courses
about digital transformation from different perspectives. For example, Hulla et a l. (2019)
consider the concept of teaching digitalization, such as training sessions
alternative and complementary theory and practice. The training aims
improve understanding of how digital technologies can improve training sessions
practical training, how digital technologies and strategies can be implemented
in a company, and how value is created with business models based on
digitization, imparting knowledge and skills for the industry and
academics. Furthermore, researchers Panichkina et al. (2019) express the formation
of the human resources management system in the conditions of digital transformation
of the economy. Similarly, Stolze et al. (2018) reflect on a
conceptualization of a novel educational approach in entrepreneurship for
digital transformation.
Innovation of pedagogical methodologies: the authors Bond et al. (2018) emphasize that the
Innovations in digital teaching are not just technical innovations, but innovations
academic, curricular, organizational and structural. Furthermore, Blaschke & Hase (2016)
emphasized that the use of the possibilities of digital technology can make the
teaching and learning to be more flexible and lead to higher attendance
student and lifelong learning skills. Therefore, Fleacă (2017), citing the
Communication on European Higher Education in the World, express that the institutions
Higher education institutions must fulfill their function of being providers of knowledge and
innovators taking advantage of new trends in digital education, exploiting the
potential of digital technologies, developing new forms of collaboration
internationally through online teaching and learning in a wide spectrum of
disciplines. In this regard, the use of digital educational resources is perceived as
a new role for teachers and students, creating flexible and
motivating, and more autonomous (Fleacă, 2017). Additionally, teachers are encouraged to
integrate collaboration tools within your courses, ensuring that Chapter 1. Research Design 35
students have a deep understanding of the pedagogical purpose behind its use
from the beginning of a course, as well as training on how to use the technology
(Peterson, 2012) and how to work collaboratively with others (Bond et al., 2018). Besides,
Researchers Bresinsky & Von Reusner (2018) introduce that approaches
participatory changes the student from passive recipient of knowledge to active co-creators
and participants in the generation of knowledge.
The digital transformation takes advantage of the emergence of new pedagogical proposals. He
authors Pérez Gama, (2019) advises designing and implementing intelligent models
focused on students to improve their cognitive and academic productivity. By
For example, the authors Stolze et al. (2018) presenting the Deep Dive Program that
combines work on a real project in the field of digital transformation with a
further academic education, open to both undergraduate students and
motivated professionals, who see the new challenge of digital transformation as a
opportunity and want to educate themselves more. Furthermore, Bresinsky & Von Reusner (2018)
consider Living Lab as an evolution that indicates an in situ nature of
Research, Development and Innovation, combining a multi-stakeholder approach
interested parties, multiple methods, multiple contexts and with a clear user focus on
co-creation. Another proposal by Hulla et al. (2019) are the learning factories that
They impart knowledge and skills for both industry and academics.
All of them integrate traditional theoretical learning, with activation and
collaboration towards a comprehensive concept, stimulating maximum results of
learning (Bresinsky & Von Reusner, 2018).
Literacy and digital skills: in the digital economy, the need arises for a
new highly professional workforce with digital skills and competencies in the
field of technology and communication Azarenko et al. (2018). The digital transformation
of the training process of professional personnel consists of raising the level of
abstraction in the development and use of professional skills that allow us
move from technical and low-level concepts to more significant and high-level concepts
higher (Bond et al., 2018). Additionally, researchers Bond et al. (2018), citing (Pensel
& Hofhues, 2017), express that, in terms of teachers' perspectives
universities, are often said to be the driving forces for implementing and
develop digital teaching and learning, and for this reason, it is recommended36 Digital Transformation in HEIs. Deployment model
technical and pedagogical guidance. The introduced teaching concept offers students
participants the possibility of acquiring skills, knowledge and abilities in the
field of digitalization (Hulla et al., 2019). Furthermore, the digital transformation in
Higher education institutions must be thought of from a global approach. The
Researchers Bresinsky & Von Reusner (2018) propose developing the skills
described in The Digital Turn (HFD, 2016) as a set of skills for
digitization, that is, the secure handling of information and privacy issues,
complex problem solving, analytical thinking, collaborative work and
self-organized in heterogeneous teams, agility, interpersonal and social skills
and intercultural. Furthermore, researchers Azarenko et al. (2018) express that the
highly professional staff should be able to interact with other people (work in
multicultural environments), have the skills of empathy, concentration and management of
attention, maintain information hygiene, to work and manage i information on
modern information environments, in media, in social networks, in marketing and in
analytical environments.
Teaching administration process: from an administrative level, the authors Tay
& Low (2017) reflect that many higher education institutions have taken advantage of
the use of technology to provide flexibility in learning and training just-
in-time for students, and to improve both the internal processes of availability
of courses such as educational quality provisions. Likewise, the researcher
Rodrigues (2017) contemplates the evolution of teaching administration from a perspective
competitive, where a global competition for candidates takes place, changes
demographics, restrictions on access to financial resources, new demands
of the labor market and the growing expectations of students to innovate their
learning, teaching, research and management experiences.
Infrastructure dimension: Digital transformation in educational institutions
top view from the infrastructure dimension has various fronts, depending
of the dimension it supports. The following sections describe them.
Digital infrastructure for teaching: digital platforms and communication platforms
learning are important tools that satisfy the standards and methods
contemporary educational systems (Bozhko et al., 2016; Wildan Zulfikar et al., 2018; Bresinsky &
Von Reusner, 2018).Chapter 1. Research Design 37
Physical infrastructure for teaching, such as laboratories. For example, Learning factory
(Hulla et al., 2019), and Living Lab (Bresinsky & Von Reusner, 2018).
Data infrastructure and security: the author Rodrigues (2017) expresses that the use
growing digital technologies and the growing connectivity of everything also entails
major challenges in the level of security, compliance and data protection and
regulations.
Software infrastructure: An agile platform is contemplated, a flexible architecture that
could handle adaptive and emergent processes (administrative, teaching and
research) (J A Faria & Nóvoa, 2017; Tay & Low, 2017; Fleacă, 2017; Thoring et al.,
2018; Stolze et al., 2018)
Curriculum dimension: This dimension has several views depending on the development process.
digital transformation that has been carried out.
Curriculum modernization: the modernization of curricula to meet the
contemporary educational standards and methods, developing curricula
international, finding new ways to deliver content through the
digital learning and the increasing use of technologies (Bozhko et al., 2016; Fleacă,
2017; Bond et al., 2018). First, tools based on digital technology to
increase the relevance of the skills training process in order to provide
greater opportunities for students to acquire those skills
transversal. And second, implement curriculum access codes outside the institution
higher education (Kaminskyi et al., 2018). Finally, the result of the processes of
Curriculum modernization should be administered by the department of
curriculum management (Tay & Low, 2017).
Flexible Curriculum: Global Requirements in the Educational Field Have Transcended Boundaries
of time and space. This is expressed in Azarenko et al. (2018), the standards of the
Third generation vocational education institutions receive considerable
degree of freedom in the implementation of a variable part of the educational program and a
set of selected disciplines, which allows them to adjust it opportunely taking into account
takes into account the development of science, technology, culture, economy, and the sphere
social because the main objective of updating the educational program is a response38 ​​Digital Transformation in HEIs. Deployment model
flexible to the needs of the labor market. For example, researchers Stolze et
to the. (2018) intend to support real business projects in small
groups and according to their needs, through an individualized study plan
flexible, rather than a standard cohort curriculum, and the creation of a system
integrated independent evaluation of qualifications in the field of ICT.
Digital Curriculum: Author Rodrigues (2017) concluded that students demand
increasingly an improvement in the “basics” of your experience, with features
such as the digitization of administrative processes, unlimited 24-hour access to
all information and services using multiple platforms or a digital curriculum.
To raise this requirement it is necessary to digitize all study plans (Thoring et
al., 2018; Pérez Gama, 2019). Furthermore, researcher G Sandhu (2018) states that
common learning, digital education centers, information centers have
revolutionized teaching and learning by enabling/supporting changes in pedagogy
curricular and digital.
Management Dimension: Improve existing work and operations: in
In reality, higher education institutions use transformation strategies
digital to improve “how” they do their existing work, apply changes to the creation of
value, reflect the influence of digital transformation, while building new
digital models in parallel or completely digitizing their current considering the new
demands of the labor market and the increasing expectations of students to innovate
their learning, teaching, research and management experiences (Rodrigues, 2017; J
A Faria & Nóvoa, 2017). In that sense, these structural changes are necessary to
exploit new technologies and in the back office, the area managers of the different
units (Human Resources, Accounting, Financial, Purchasing, Advisory Units estuary
Legal, etc.) to plan, assign and monitor the work to be carried out (J A Faria & Nóvoa,
2017).
Financial and technological aspects: digital transformation requires large investments,
Therefore, many challenges in digital transformation in educational institutions
higher are related to financial aspects and technological limitations, namely,
the ability to finance a digital transformation effort, given the effort required
to get rid of the past and adopt new and extreme Technologies (Rodrigues, 2017;
J A Faria & Nóvoa, 2017; Pérez Gama, 2019).Chapter 1. Research Design 39
Reorganize administrative units: the changes caused by a transformation
digital in higher education institutions are not only limited to infrastructure
technological, but they extend to the levels of the organizational structure of the
institution. Depending on the digital transformation process that will be carried out within
of higher education institutions, the responsible department must assume its
commitment, which is consistent with their capabilities and abilities. Therefore, the
authors J A Faria & Nóvoa (2017); Azarenko et al. (2018); Thoring et al. (2018)
reconsider that higher education institutions, and their administrative units
become a requirement, furthermore, they decide the most efficient way to provide the
service to eliminate most bureaucratic processes and parallel tasks
additional ones that fatigue rather than provide relief.
For this approach to be successful, universities must restructure their delivery model.
academic and administrative governance, beginning with a change of mentality, away from
“administrative thinking” towards an “entrepreneurial mentality”, and redesigning the
administrative and business academic model of the Institution. Through the
recognition of opportunities, demonstrating the ability to act quickly and
precision, agilely developing new concepts and allowing an infrastructure
flexible and supportive (Stolze et al., 2018; Pérez Gama, 2019).
Informed decision making: Digital transformation within units
Administrative functions will allow staff members to manage processes in “their
hands”, record the dates of tasks, archive the documents produced and
exchange messages with other parties interested in the processes. Furthermore, the reports
of activity and service level indicators integrated with the mechanisms of
Business intelligence provides a comprehensive view of business processes in
course and a critical vision for effective decision making (J A Faria & Nóvoa, 2017).
Research dimension: The research dimension has also been
impregnated by digital transformation. Research is forced to align with the
digital transformation to meet the requirements and expectations of actors
involved in the processes research projects (Rodrigues, 2017). First, the authors
Bresinsky & Von Reusner (2018); Thoring et al. (2018); Hulla et al. (2019) have shown
interest in achieving the integration of research processes with the processes of 40 Digital Transformation in HEIs. Deployment model
teaching-learning. Secondly, the author Pérez Gama (2019) considers that the
Research must merge with innovation to generate intellectual assets
digital. Finally, Professor Wildan Zulfikar et al. (2018) contemplates that one of the
drivers of change in higher education institutions is the integration of
industry, where students are exposed to more practical learning processes
based on the industry, and on the other hand, the existence of
research associations.
Human resources dimension: There is a relationship between digital transformation in
higher education institutions and human resources. On the one hand, the transformation
Digital influences and impacts human resources factors and contributes to improving the
productivity (Betchoo, 2016). On the other hand, the digital capabilities of the resources
Humans are the key facilitator of university digital transformation through
competent digital workforce (G Sandhu, 2018). In that sense, the dimension of
Human resources has different approaches. First, authors Bresinsky & Von
Reusner (2018); Clair Sullivan & Staib (2018); Grab et al. (2019) reflect that the domains
where these organizations are innovating quickly and comprehensively are the
Virtual collaboration and data analysis. This means avoiding old forms of leadership
hierarchical and lead leadership towards more agile ways of working, leadership not only
to explore, evaluate and plan the implementation of new technologies, but also
to take into account the impact of these innovations on the members of the organization.
Secondly, the researcher Betchoo (2016) expresses that there must be a
effective coordination between the implementation and use of digital technologies to
reap the benefits in human resource development, talent and management
performance. Thirdly, the authors Tay & Low (2017); Azarenko et al. (2018)
consider the need to train new staff in the use of quality assessment
independent competition and in the establishment of integration links between
superiors. Finally, the authors Betchoo (2016; Azarenko et al. (2018); Hulla et al.
(2019); Pérez Gama (2019) consider the importance of digital transformation within
of public organizations and their impact on human resources factors
related, such as human resource development, talent and performance management,
intellectual and creative abilities, staff creativity and competences for
future workforce, as digital talent, equipped with digital experience such to promote,
implement and maintain the system towards the IV Industrial Revolution. Chapter 1. Research Design 41
Extension dimension: Another dimension permeated by the digital transformation in
higher education institutions is the Extension dimension. The Authors Clair
Sullivan & Staib (2018); Azarenko et al. (2018; Panichkina et al. (2019) consider defining
the use of independent certification of competence and the establishment of links
of integration between universities, specialized secondary schools, large
companies and public administration in the region. Furthermore, the opportunity to improve the
adaptation mechanisms of graduates in the labor market through
interaction of educational organizations and companies, where the qualification of
workers, in terms of turning them into “digital appendages”, reducing the
proportion of workers with average skills, who are easier to replace
by digital technologies. Furthermore, Pérez Gama (2019) considers that one of the pillars
of the digital transformation model is the social projection of the institution both at the
internal and external, for the transfer of knowledge and technologies that promote
the productivity and competitiveness of the country.
Governance dimension of digital transformation: An important challenge that
organizations face today is how to adopt and take advantage of the New
Digital Technologies, since the ability to promote digital transformation is
largely determined by a clear digital strategy enabled by a culture of
change, risk taking and innovation, supported by their leaders (Stolze et al., 2018). In
Consequently, the governance dimension of digital transformation exists in
higher education institutions because, for a highly digitalized organization,
It is crucial to understand and manage the change management of digital innovations such as
an important factor in successful implementation (Bresinsky & Von Reusner, 2018; Clair
Sullivan & Staib, 2018). Likewise, the analysis of the needs of the institution

minimize the impact of these innovations on organizational members (Bresinsky
& Von Reusner, 2018; Grab et al., 2019).42 Digital Transformation in HEIs. Deployment model

Digital transformation requires a data architecture and its public data model
with exchange opportunities between universities (J A Faria & Nóvoa, 2017;
Kaminskyi et al., 2018). Additionally, it introduces managers and resource professionals
humans as key actors to guarantee the effective management of the transformation of
data in business (Betchoo, 2016). Secondly, from the perspective of
teaching, in modern conditions, educational materials are already created in formats

Digital transformation forces companies to develop, change and adapt to the
different stages of digital evolution. In other words, it promotes the reinvention of

digital technologies to improve, improve or replace traditional services with

superior? -RQ2.
Digital transformation guidelines in higher education institutions: from a vision
macro-organizational, digital transformation requires a well-rounded digital strategy
planned that includes the digital transformation framework in which all key actors
and interested parties can play an active role in shaping the
university to thrive in the digital age (G Sandhu, 2018). In this sense, the
main challenges of the digital transformation of a higher education institution
It is the definition of a strategic vision for digital transformation. The institutions
of higher education need a strategic vision that allows the entire institution
join in the implementation of digital initiatives. A clear vision will make the team
and stakeholders become more involved and invested in the transformation process
digital. For a digital strategy to be successful, it is necessary to ensure that the
higher education institutions have the necessary resources for their
implementation (Rodrigues, 2017).
Assuming that the general objective of digital transformations in the information system
Higher education is the transformation of educational services and processes of
accompanying business, there are three different possible directions that need to be analyzed:
- transformation and redefinition of educational services to match the
changes to the university's business process system; - transformation of 44 Digital Transformation in HEIs. Deployment model
business processes aimed at creating new and improving business processes
existing IT-based systems as the basis for further analysis and transformation of
educational services; - combining the first and second directions to integrate the
simultaneous transformation in both directions (Kaminskyi et al., 2018). In the aspect
of the transformation of products and services, the following stages are distinguished: improvement
(add additional services), expansion (add new product features or
existing services through digital components) and redefinition (creating new
products or services that replace the previous ones). In terms of the processes of
business, the stages are as follows: creation (the emergence of new business processes
business on the basis of IT), leverage (the emergence of new there are opportunities for
achieve greater efficiency of business processes) and integration (the combination of
new and traditional business processes in a single infrastructure). In what
refers to a synthesis of the key digital transformation guidelines the authors Faria &
Nóvoa (2017) describe the main pillars of a digital transformation: 1- Develop
new services based on digital, 2-improve user experience, 3- Reengineering
of processes, 4- Strengthen technological infrastructures, promoting their agility and
adaptability, and 5- Develop a decision-making support system. To analyze
the current and future university, the author (Wildan Zulfikar et al., 2018) considered CANVAS 5.
Taking into account digital transformation from a process-focused vision
educational teaching-learning, the authors consider the following:
Researchers Hulla et al. (2019) citing (Levy & Murnane, 2013) say that the Fourth
Industrial Revolution, propagates the idea that personnel focus on activities
innovative, creative and communicative. Likewise, citing (Gehrke, Kühn, & Rule, 2015)
indicate that workers will have to perform more complex and indirect tasks, such as
work with robots and collaborating machines. Additionally, they must deal with the information
generated in real time, as well as a greater amount of data and communicate with
machines. Therefore, teaching and learning environments would have to be
consistent with these requirements, and the emergence of common learning areas, centers
of digital education, digital learning centers, information areas that have
revolutionized teaching and learning. The topic of digital pedagogy is presented
such as the use of electronic elements to improve or change the experience of the
education (G Sandhu, 2018). While others recognize the entrepreneurial mentalityChapter 1. Research Design 45
as a driver of digital transformation, therefore, they consider the first
step in the co-creation process to conduct a discussion among the leaders of
higher education institutions and the Center for Entrepreneurship, and a series of
relevant stakeholders (e.g., faculty, faculty deans, and industry partners
and technological) through individual meetings and a broader workshop to formulate the
requirements and guidelines for future training in the field of entrepreneurship and
digitization (Stolze et al., 2018).
Regarding the perspectives of university teachers, it is often said that they are the
driving forces for implementing and developing digital teaching and learning, and
For this reason, technical and pedagogical guidance is recommended (Bozhko et al., 2016).
Depending on the teaching-learning methodology and the results of the
learning, strategies will be developed. Researchers Hulla et al. (2019)
they mention the Instit Innovation projects as a very important infrastructure resource
important where training laboratories based on studies of
cases. Similarly, the authors Bozhko et al. (2016) suggest a guide that consists of
several laboratory tasks, containing theoretical information, a calculation task, a
practical task, a laboratory guide and a self-test questionnaire,
providing the connection between different disciplines. Finally, Professor Fleacă
(2017) delves into the process-based model to design digital practices of
teaching and learning. The process-based model begins with the variables of
necessary input such as educational organization data, and offers capabilities
digital teaching and learning to the organization in the attempt to define and integrate
digital learning technologies in organizational practices. Another approach
is the Living Labs concept that allows cooperation in all stages of a development process.
development – ​​ideation, conceptualization, testing, prototyping, validation,
development, exploitation and marketing – in a participatory approach to the network of
real-world context, bridging the gap between exploration and exploitation and knowledge
and solutions (Bresinsky & Von Reusner, 2018).
As mentioned above, from a teaching perspective,
digital transformation of higher education institutions requires the creation of
learning guides, but also, the learning resources that must be developed
to meet the requirements established by the guidelines. The authors Tay & Low46 Digital Transformation in HEIs. Deployment model
(2017) describe that the process of developing learning resources in institutions
Higher education involves planning and coordination among multiple groups
functions of the academic faculty and administrative officials. These include
internal departments as well as external stakeholders, publishers and suppliers
external parties involved in the creation and delivery services of course materials
to higher education institutions.
Digital Transformation Center: Authors Kaminskyi et al. (2018) specify as part
of the implementation of digital transformation in higher education institutions,
that the university business process system requires the creation of a directory
administrative services for the training and internal research process,
personnel management, infrastructure management and other support services. Of the same
Likewise, the authors J A Faria & Nóvoa (2017) detailed how a Service Center was created

in a higher education institution, with the aim of improving the quality of the
services provided to the academy and reducing overall costs
From the point d In view of teaching, the authors Thoring et al. (2018) consider in
Instead of a centralization of information, knowledge and experience in
the field of digital education. Teachers want a “digitization center” at
that they can contact for information and practical advice on services

the implementation of new digitalization ideas. According to G Sandhu (2018), the centers,
Libraries have offered services such as platform development and support
technological (learning management systems, digital assessment tools,
diagnostic tools, plagiarism software, etc.), support instructional design,
development of a new type of learning spaces, digital enrichment to support
problem-based, collaborative, competency-based learning, and also
establishment of research data management service. These centers support
pedagogically, through quality and well-designed technological spaces that
include interactive computing, multimedia creation, large-scale visualization in
visualization studio, 3D scan printing.
Reengineering process: to be successful, digital transformation in healthcare institutions
Higher education requires a profound reengineering of all support processes, Chapter 1. Research Design 47
a task that must be treated with deep sensitivity and attention, to overcome the
natural resistance to change of the different headquarters within the institutions of
higher education. The company, taking into account that the digital transformation
promotes the reinvention of the Pérez Gama institution (2019), and due to the size of the
university and the hundreds of processes managed daily, reengineering and
certification of all processes and the dematerialization of document management,
while maintaining the agility of technological infrastructures, is a
very demanding process, requiring an innovative approach to be successful.
Compilation and execution system: It is required to develop a system that has the
agility to evolve, harmonize and consolidate procedures as they emerge
naturally (J A Faria & Nóvoa, 2017).
Competence Center: Authors such as Thoring et al. (2018) and Bozhko et al. (2016)
consider the center of teaching and learning, as support to the members of the
faculty at the university, information and practical support, including introductory courses
for teaching and learning, as well as a range of courses for the development
professional related to university teaching. Taking into account that the
university education requires the development of a strategy for transformation
digital and the formation of new information and communication skills. Is required,
develop digital capabilities who are the key enabler of digital transformation
university through the competent digital workforce (Kaminskyi et al., 2018).
Enterprise architecture-IT architecture management-Digitalization: The architecture
business and business architecture constitute a conceptual tool that
helps organizations understand their own structure and the approach with which
they work (Pérez Gama, 2019). The author Fleacă ()2017, citing (Dag H & Kjersti, 2016),
indicates that other scholars who have studied the challenges induced by
implementation of enterprise IT architecture in educational institutions
higher level evidenced key benefits of integrating IT systems with
educational processes in terms of greater agility of the educational organization, better
decision making and lower IT-related risks.
The digital transformation of higher education institutions must go through a
process called digitalization, which is converting existing physical assets into their 48 Digital Transformation in HEIs. Deployment model
digital form (Wildan Zulfikar et al., 2018). This process permeates all scenarios
within it, from the mission and strategic processes, to the support processes. By
For this reason, higher education institutions must start looking at digital
comprehensively and to transform themselves by applying digital thinking in everything they do;
how internal processes operate; and how they obtain their main mission (Rodrigues, 2017).
Change Management: A Shift Towards Digital-First Mindset Puts All Staff
at the forefront of innovation and business reinvention in the digital age (G Sandhu,
2018). This change from technological diffusion to digital transformation must have a
effect on human resources (Betchoo, 2016). In other words, efforts are made
on the part of the staff to maintain quality and safety against
digital disruption and more research is required to better understand the process (Clair
Sullivan & Staib, 2018). If digital transformation positively impacts resources
humans, is likely to promote visible changes in performance, production,
service quality, talent development, among others (Betchoo, 2016).
This is how change management must be considered in all stages of the
implementation of a digital transformation, before, during and after. understand the
total picture with proper governance and analysis of the entire system is essential to
accurately evaluate the digital cycle (Clair Sullivan and Staib, 2018).
In general, a digital strategy depends largely on several factors, some
technological and others of a non-technological nature (Rodrigues, 2017). Some reasons for
The fact that companies do not push to address digitalization processes is evident given
the challenging nature of exercise or, since the standardization of internal processes
can require a lot of time and resources (Grab et al., 2019). Among these factors are the
culture and internal organization, organizational silos; organizational resistance
to change, the lack of resources and budget, the legal and regulatory implications, the
understanding customer behavior or impact; lack of data to justify the
value of digital transformation; lack of skills and digital literacy and the
security (Rodrigues, 2017). Chapter 1. Research Design 49
1.3 Knowledge gap
In response to the demands of the fourth industrial revolution, the institutions of
higher education have been forced to transform to coexist in a world
digital. However, this digital transformation not only implies technological progress, it is
more transcendental and generates changes so significant that they affect the culture and dynamics
university in all its contexts, from pedagogical approaches, teaching and
learning, to administrative processes, research, extension, infrastructure,
budget, among others. In this context, digital transformation in educational institutions
Higher education requires rethinking, restructuring, reinventing the institutions of
higher education, from its multipurpose, multiprocess, multidisciplinary nature,
multi-state and multi-user, it is a collective effort that puts the person at the center
of the process of development, transformation and its impact on society.
From the systematic literature review, the prevalence of case studies is evident.
conceptual and illustrative as a clear indication of the lack of maturity of this
phenomenon, therefore, future research should focus more on establishing the
theoretical foundations of the field, based on existing theories or developing others
new ones (Reis et al., 2018), which allow higher education institutions
address digital transformation opportunities and challenges.

identify relationships as meaningful when, in fact, they are present in the
population (Joseph F. Hair et al., 2019).
PLS-SEM is now widely applied in many social science disciplines,
including organizational management, educational sciences, behavioral sciences,
international management, human resources management, information management systems,
operations management, marketing management, strategic management, hotel management, and
supply chain management, as well as the publication of several textbooks,
edited volumes, and special issues of academic journals (Cepeda Carrión &
Roldán Salgueiro, 2003; Martínez Ávila & Fierro Moreno, 2018; Joseph F. Hair et al., 2019).
This statistical technique for series of estimates of simultaneous equations using
Multiple regressions are characterized by two basic components: 1) the structural model
and 2) the measurement model. The structural model is the guiding model that shows the
dependency relationships between independent variables (exogenous) and variables
dependent (endogenous). The measurement model shows the relationships between the
constructs (latent variables) and indicators (observable variables); in this model,
The contribution of each item (reactive) to the measurement scale is evaluated, that is,
specifies which indicators define each construct. Furthermore, it evaluates the reliability of
constructs and indicators (Martínez A & Fierro M., 2018).
Below are the steps to be carried out in the research (See Figure 2-1): Chapter 2. Research Methodology 53

3. Application of information collection instruments: The survey will be
applied to actors in a self-administered manner using software
existing. To guarantee internal validity, the same instrument will be
administered to all actors. Likewise, to validate the external validity, the
instrument will be applied in Colombian public universities.
4. Analysis and processing of information: Before submitting the data to analysis
multivariate statistical analysis, a descriptive analysis of the data will be carried out. Likewise
Due data processing will be done for subsequent quantitative analysis.
5. Statistical analysis of the information and reporting of results: It is considered to use
the multivariate statistical analysis technique, using the SmartPLS tool,
to validate the measurement model and contrast the structural model using
the PLS-SEM technique. The data will be analyzed following the procedure
suggested by Hair et al. (2017). First, the measurement model is evaluated to
establish the reliability, convergent validity and discriminant validity of the scales
used. Subsequently, the fit of the structural model is evaluated and
whether or not they support the research hypotheses.
Specifically for the development of point 5, Hair et al. (2017) established the
methodology that consists of the following stages to apply PLS-SEM (See Figure 2-
2).Chapter 2. Research Methodology 55
Figure 2-2: Stages for analysis and validation of the model applying PLS-SEM
Stage 1. Specification of the structural model: the structural model (also called
internal model in the context of PLS-SEM) represents the constructs or latent variables
(circles or ovals). The structural model also shows the relationships (paths) between the
constructs. Latent variables can be exogenous (those constructs that
explain other constructs in the model) or endogenous (those constructs that are
explained by the model). Trajectory models are developed based on theory.
(Hair et al., 2017). In addition to observing the latent and observable variables, it is also
It is important to mention two aspects that may be immersed in the model and they are: the
mediation and moderation (Martínez A & Fierro M., 2018). Mediation involves a
situation where one or more mediating variables explain the processes through the
which an exogenous construct influences an endogenous one (Noreña, 2020). On the other hand, the
moderation, occurs when the effect of an exogenous latent variable on a variable
endogenous latent variable depends on the values ​​that a third variable, called variable
moderator, which moderates the relationship (Noreña, 2020).56 Digital Transformation in HEIs. Deployment model
Stage 2. Development and specification of the measurement model: The measurement model of the
constructs (also called external models in PLS-SEM) show the
relationships between the constructs and their observable variables or indicators (rectangles).
In general, there are two different ways to measure unobservable variables. One approach
is known as a reflective model and the other is a formative model. In a training model
The arrows go from the indicators to the construct, indicating a causal relationship
(predictive) in that direction. While a reflective model the arrows go from the
construct towards the indicators, indicating the assumption that the construct causes the
measurement (more precisely, co-variation) of the indicator variables.
Stage 3: Design a study to generate empirical results. In this stage it develops
the collection and examination of data. The appropriate sample size is evaluated and
select the missing data estimation and approximation model. To run this
stage, researchers will take into account general rules such as those provided
by Cohen (1992) in his statistical power analyzes for multiple regression models,
provided that the measurement models have acceptable quality in terms of loads

Prior to evaluating the measurement model, it should be considered, if necessary, the

It is measured by several first-order latent variables.
In that case, researchers should apply a combination of the indicators approach

Stage 4a: Evaluation of reflective measures:
Internal consistency or scale reliability: According to Beckett et al. (2017), the
Construct reliability aims to test the internal consistency of all indicators by
measure the concept; That is, the rigor with which the variables manifest
They are measuring the latent variable. The reliability coefficient measure, which evaluates
the consistency of the entire scale is Cronbach's alpha. The lower limit generally
agreed for Cronbach's alpha e s .70. Additionally, Cronbach's alpha is only
applicable to latent variables with reflective indicators (Cepeda Carrión & Roldán
Salgueiro, 2003).
Convergent validity: It is a measure that indicates that a set of indicators, items or
reagents represent a single underlying construct (Martínez A & Fierro M., 2018). Is
That is, it evaluates the degree to which two measures of the same concept are correlated.
Here the researcher can look for alternative measures of a concept and then
correlate them with the summed scale. The high correlations here indicate that the scale
you are measuring your intended concept (Beckett et al., 2017). Convergent validity is
calculated with the AVE, which measures that the variance of the construct can be explained through Chapter 2. Research Methodology 59
of its indicators (Martínez A & Fierro M., 2018). The AVE must be greater than or equal to .50
and provides the amount of variance that a construct obtains from its indicators in
relationship to the amount of variance due to measurement error; This means that each
construct or variable explains at least 50% of the variance of the indicators.
Individual item reliability: Reliability measures the degree to which the measurements are free.
of random errors. This reliability examines the simple loadings or correlations of the
indicators such as the construct they aim to measure. The load value must be equal to or
greater than .708, since they indicate that the construct explains more than 50% of the variance of the
indicator, which provides acceptable reliability of the items (Hair et al., 2019).
Discriminant validity: Discriminant validity refers to the extent to which a
construct is empirically distinct from other constructs within the structural model (F.
Hair et al., 2019). The empirical test is again the correlation between the measurements,
but this time the summed scale correlates with a similar measure, but
conceptually different. Now the correlation should be low, showing that the
scale is sufficiently different from the other concept (Beckett et al., 2017).
In summary, convergent validity confirms that the scale is correlated with other
known measures of the concept; while discriminant validity ensures that the
scale is sufficiently different from other concepts to be distinct (Beckett et al.,
2017).
Additionally, prior to validating the structural model, it is necessary to study the
validity and reliability of the second-order constructs that will act as indicators
in the structural model.
Stage 4b: Evaluation of formative measures: Convergent validity, is the degree to which
the formatively measured construct is positively correlated with a measure
alternative (reflective or single item) of the same construct (Noreña, 2020). The collinearity
between indicators, which arises when two variables are highly correlated; and the
significance and relevance of the weights, which are the result of a multiple regression of
a construct with its indicators. The weights are the main criterion to assess the
relative importance of each indicator in the formative measurement models (Noreña,
2020).60 Digital Transformation in HEIs. Deployment model
Stage 5: Evaluation of the structural model: Once the measurement model has been analyzed,
requires evaluating the structural model. The final stage involves efforts to test the
validity of the structural model and its corresponding hypothetical theoretical relationships. The
Structural evaluation of the model analyzes the R2, the predictive relevance (Q2), the size and
the significance of the standardized regression coefficients or path coefficients and the
effect sizes (f2 and q2), the interpretation of results, and the support or not of the
hypothesis.
The basic PLS algorithm follows a two-step approach, the first concerns the
iterative estimation of the latent variable scores, and the second step is
refers to the final estimation of the weights, loads and path coefficients through the
estimation of ordinary least squares (multiple and simple) and in the analysis of
main components (Martínez A & Fierro M., 2018)
Stage 6: Advanced analysis. Once the structural model (latent variables and
observable), it is also important to mention two aspects that may be involved
in the model, and they are mediation and moderation (Martínez Ávila & Fierro Moreno, 2018).
The core of mediation analysis is that it assumes a sequence of relationships in which
that an independent variable affects a mediating variable, which then affects a
dependent variable, see Figure 2-4 (Nitzl et al., 2016).
Mediation and moderation are similar in that they describe situations in which the
relationship between two constructs depends on a third variable. Mediation happens
when a third mediating variable intervenes between two other constructs
related. More precisely, a change in the exogenous variable causes a change in
the mediating variable which, in turn, results in a change in the endogenous variable
in the PLS path model. Therefore, a mediating variable governs nature (i.e.
that is, the underlying mechanism or process) of the relationship between two constructs (Hair et
al., 2017). For its part, moderation describes a situation in which the relationship between
two constructs is not constant, but depends on the values ​​of a third variable,
called moderator variable. The moderating variable (or construct) changes the
strength or even the direction of a relationship between two constructs in the model (Hair et
al., 2017). The approach separately evaluates direct, indirect and total effects. Chapter 2. Research Methodology 61

holistic and evolutionary integration over time. This evolution may be the result
of a gradual change in the behavior of individual elements in the company, or
can be the result of a deliberate and conscious action, which aims to carry out
changes in a company (Harmsen et al., 2009). With the fourth industrial revolution, as
says Schwab (2015) the transformation in its scale, scope and complexity will be different

Consequently, the pressure on companies to align their business strategy with the

The strategic context of organizations is being profoundly transformed:

nature of entire industries (Teichert, 2019). From the educational field, the

as organizations (Eaton & Stevens, 2020). The objective of a digital transformation is
continuous optimization, in such a way, it can detect changes in the market and respond
quickly (Gobble, 2018).
To orchestrate these profound changes, a transformation is required within the
universities, synchronized as a paradigm shift for leadership in education.
Change occurs as a natural manifestation of the developmental sequence in the
maturity transformation process. At the execution level, there is the company
operational related to “normal” operations (a first order system), while
that at the level of transformation is the business transformation company
(a second order system) (Harmsen et al., 2009).
Next, digital transformation will be explained as a transformation process
organizational and its perspectives for change will be described.
3.1 Digital Transformation as Transformation
Organizational
According to Kilmann, et al. (1988), cited by Calderón Hernández et al. (2010), the
Transformation is “a process by which organizations examine what they were,
what they are, what they will need to be and how to make the necessary changes.” For them the
Transformation is characterized by being a non-linear process that requires great effort
of the organization as a whole and not a simple approximation of its parts. In addition,
To achieve this, it is necessary to understand that organizational transformations focus
in human, cultural, social processes, encourages collaboration between leaders of the
organization and members in conjunction with technological and structural elements
(Calderón Hernández et al., 2010; Pérez-Vallejo et al., 2017). On the other hand, not allChapter 3. Theoretical Framework 65
organizational changes are in the same order of magnitude, according to Bartunek &
Moch (1987). Organizational transformation is the work of facilitating change in
organizations (Sugarman, 2001). Since the 70s and 80s, these changes have
received names like “first order” (single loop, alpha shift) or “second order” (double
loop, gamma shift). Thus, authors such as Amir & Uri, 1986 cited by Pérez-Vallejo et al.
(2017) introduced organizational change as a strategic and lasting process
in the time.
The first order change occurs incrementally, and is defined as those
Minor improvements and adjustments that do not change the core of the system, and are developed
naturally within its established paradigm; and the second order change is in
the “core” of the organization and is irreversible. The change has occurred in the very essence,
in the kernel, and nothing special needs to be done to maintain the change that has been made.
reached. In contrast to first-order change, second-order change has
a wider reach and is more durable. It is deeper and involves changes in the
thought, not only in behavior (Amir & Uri, 1986; Bartunek & Moch, 1987).
Furthermore, it is a multi-layered process that simultaneously affects different
levels of organizations and even to the context of the organization's operation (Ferlie
et al., 1996). Such change is often required when organizations change their
basic mission, enter completely new markets or when facing a crisis
by failing to meet competitive challenges (Sugarman, 2015).
The importance of external pressures and the role of crisis in initiating change in
large organizations, illustrating the cocktail of internal and external pressures that
produces strategic organizational change. The transformation process implies that the
system would go beyond present forms. Since emergent forms rarely
are clear, it is impossible to specify the exact nature of the transformational change
except to suggest that it generally tends to produce systems with: (1) a higher level
of structure that can encompass and manage the expanded system; (2) greater simplicity
general that increases the efficiency of the operation; (3) higher levels of consciousness
self-reflective, allowing the system to see its own functioning more clearly
and therefore allows for a more harmonious orchestration between all components of the
system (Elgin & Bushnell, 1977). In this sense, it is the incorporation of changes

which led to greater emphasis on a macro or holistic view of organizational change
(Ferlie et al., 1996). In other words, the second order change is a change
multidimensional radical organizational, multini vel, qualitative, discontinuous that involves
a paradigm shift (Amir & Uri, 1986).
It is significant to highlight that organizational transformation is defined as the work of

(Sugarman, 2015). When the organization's belief system no longer explains the
In reality, nor does it help shape policies and operations, the organization goes through
a crisis. In this situation, dominant coalitions tend to adhere to the old
paradigm, to increase centralization and to call for "going back to basics." These actions
They deepen the crisis until a turning point is reached. In that case, the
organization either stops functioning or "suddenly jumps" to a higher order and a new
paradigm, with a new vision of the world, a new organizational philosophy, beliefs,
values, structure, policies and operations (Amir & Uri, 1986). As Adams (2005) points out
Organizational transformation means a change in both thought and action,
as a more fundamental level that has been achieved so far by most of the
change's agents. The author K. Lewin, (1947) cited by Pérez-Vallejo et al. (2017) describes
organizational transformation as a modification of the forces that maintain the
behavior of a stable system, so said behavior is a product of
two types of forces: those that help change to take place (driving forces) and
those who resist the change from occurring (restrictive forces) who want

the thaw, the motivation for change is created or its need is evident;
Movement, can occur through the assimilation of new information, the exposure of
new concepts or the development of a different perspective; and refreezing or
stabilization of change (Calderón Hernández et al., 2010). Later, Schein
(1996) added that to the unfreezing stage three sub-processes: discussion of the
expectations, induction of the desire for learning (which occurs once the
the validity and relevance of the facts initially discussed) and provision of security
psychological, which converts anxiety into motivation for change (Calderón Hernández et
al., 2010). Finally, change occurs through cognitive restructuring in the
which words are redefined, concepts are interpreted more broadly or
they learn new standards of evaluation and judgment (Calderón Hernández et al., 2010).Chapter 3. Theoretical Framework 67
On the other hand, the authors Amir & Uri (1986) propose evolutionary change by distinguishing
five general stages:
Stage 1. Planned organizational change and development: Changes in the environment and in
the organization; adaptation efforts by development; step by step changes
step into the current belief system, purpose and mission.
Stage 2.C awareness: Incremental and minor changes cannot
provide satisfactory solutions; There is a call to "go back to basics" and to
stick to the old, "muddle through"; crisis.
Stage 3. Creating readiness for change, facilitating the new: New things emerge

Stage 4. Creating energy for change, creating an open space: The new

Stage 5. Facilitate the transition: New ideas are translated into norms,

3.2 Digital Transformation in Institutions
Higher education
Digital transformation is the deep and accelerated transformation of the activities of the
business, processes, competencies and models to make the most of the
changes and opportunities provided by digital technologies and their impact on
society, in a strategic and priority way (Demirkan et al., 2016). Additionally,
It is defined as a complex organizational transformation that aligns in a holistic,
harmonious and strategic approach, agile and flexible processes, people, information,
supported by current and emerging technologies (Castro Benavides et al., 2020). So
Likewise, the author Teichert (2019) defines digital transformation as a process of change
disruptive or incremental. It begins with the adoption and use of digital technologies, then68 Digital Transformation in HEIs. Deployment model
evolves towards an implicit holistic transformation of an organization. By becoming
in a paradigm of change, the "digital transformation", underlined by the fourth revolution
industrial, is surrounding the universities, and pressuring them in turn to
transform, in order to comply with new social requirements. Therefore,
only change in the organizational paradigm can generate high performance.
Furthermore, each paradigm shift needs to be anticipated by a change in the
strategies and methods to facilitate the next level of paradigm shift. Like in the
Kuhn's theory of scientific revolutions, paradigms or organizational frameworks
They nest inside each other. Each new paradigm is an extension of the old one,
providing a broader frame of reference in which both coexist (Amir &
Uri, 1986)
Digital transformation generates changes in vision and meaning, impacting culture
immersed in the university, the administrative and training activities, its evaluations,
pedagogical approaches, teaching, research, extension and
administration, as well as the people immersed in it. It's not just about what
universities invest in technology, it's about how they use this investment, and how
New leadership makes a digital transformation successful. The transformation
Digital not only attempts to measure the extent to which an organization is able to benefit
of the use of technologies, but is also seen as an evolutionary process through
which technologies become a fundamental element of their daily lives, affecting
all dimensions that involve both people and the organization itself
(Rodríguez-Abitia & Bribiesca-Correa, 2021). That is, digital transformation must be
a comprehensive and holistic transformation, and must be approached from a perspective
technological, organizational and social (Castro Benavides et al., 2020).
In this context, the changes that have occurred within universities are
evident in different scenarios, such as teaching, infrastructure, curriculum,
administration, research and extension, business processes, resources
humans, governance of digital transformation, information and digital marketing
(Castro Benavides et al., 2020). This diversity makes it understandable, as Castro summarizes
Benavides et al. (2020) that within higher education institutions the
digital transformation has been approached from different perspectives (organizational,
socio-cultural, and technological). The importance of perspective is notableChapter 3. Theoretical Framework 69

of digital transformation. Because organizational change is related to
people, processes, strategies, structures and competitive dynamics, is where they reside
most of the challenges and opportunities (Wade, 2015). Becoming a task that
It must be faced with deep sensitivity and attention, to overcome the natural resistance to
change of the different dependencies or departments (J A Faria & Nóvoa, 2017).
Finally, from the technological perspective, where digital technologies exist
cross-border technologies (IoT devices, 3D printing and big data analysis) drive
transformations that go far beyond the optimizations of internal processes, since
that can induce drastic changes in business models, organizational culture
and corporate and industry-wide structures (Nadkarni & Prügl, 2021). As

always focusing on the user as the center of development (Castro Benavides et al.,
2020).
3.3 Transformation Maturity Levels
Digital
The dynamic and evolutionary nature of digital transformation takes place in the
universities, while they are impacted by technology. This process of
evolution is defined by proposals of digital maturity, understanding it as the state
of the digital transformation of a company and the description of what a company has already
achieved in terms of carrying out transformation efforts. Although there is no approach
standard to describe digital maturity levels (Teichert, 2019), the author IDC infodoc
(2019) defines that a transformation process must incorporate several states of70 Digital Transformation in HEIs. Deployment model

3.4 Perspectives on Digital Transformation
Digital transformation generates changes in meaning, affecting the culture immersed in
the administrative and training activities of the university, its evaluations, approaches
pedagogical, teaching, research, extension and administration processes, as well as
the people immersed in it. It does not refer only to the investment that
universities do in technology, but also how they use this investment and make the
leadership changes necessary for successful digital transformation to occur. For another
On the other hand, digital transformation not only attempts to measure the extent to which an organization is
able to benefit from the use of IT, but is also seen as an evolutionary process a74 Digital Transformation in HEIs. Deployment model
through which, IT becomes a fundamental element of your daily life, affecting
all dimensions that involve both people and the organization itself
(Rodríguez-Abitia & Bribiesca-Correa, 2021). The radical and rapid changes that
require internally and in the environment make the importance of managing this type
of change is extremely significant for the survival and success of the
organization. The author Tichy (1982) argues that three different perspectives coexist
in organizational theory and practice, representing different ways of explaining
the organizational, technical, political and cultural reality. The technical paradigm is greatly limited
measure to organize the most effective way to get the job done; the political paradigm
includes theories of exchange, conflict, power and coalition problems, and allocation of
rewards, and limits its scope to political aspects; finally, the cultural paradigm
It restricts much of its scope to cultural aspects. Tichy (1982) suggests integrating
the three previous perspectives in a higher level organizational paradigm than
encompasses everything.
On the other hand, the authors Gurbaxani & Dunkle (2019) express that the transformation
Digital requires a useful framework that encompasses strategic, technological,
of human capital and organizational culture. Furthermore, interventions that aim to
facilitating a paradigm shift must include changes not only in the purpose of the
organization but also in its three basic subsystems; Otherwise, the change will not
It will remain. From this perspective, second-order change interventions
should aim to change not only the values, norms, attitudes, structures
and technology, but also the power structure (Gurbaxani & Dunkle, 2019). The
Digital transformation in higher education institutions requires rethinking,
restructure and reinvent, from its multipurpose, multiprocess nature,
multidisciplinary, multistate and multiactor. It's a collective effort tive that places the person
at the center of the process of development, transformation and impact on society. That is to say,
Digital transformation must be a comprehensive and holistic transformation of institutions
of higher education and must be approached from a technological perspective,
organizational and social (Castro Benavides et al., 2020). In the following paragraphs
will describe these perspectives.Chapter 3. Theoretical Framework 75
3.4.1 Organizational Perspective
The importance of the organizational perspective in the process of
digital transformation of higher education institutions. This section consolidates
the specific dimensions that the researchers have selected separately in
relationship with this perspective, resulting in the emergence of four
subdimensions: information, administration, business process and governance of the
digital transformation (Matt et al., 2015; Rosing & Etzel, 2020; Castro Benavides et al.,
2021).
▪ Information dimension (INF)
Mancini's law states: “Organizations are information network systems.
They only work effectively when there are clear and predictable information flows
within and between these networks.” Today more than ever, business processes are
interconnected and content/information is key in an increasing number of
processes (i-scoop, 2018). The dimension of information in digital transformation is
a very valuable asset, and information is at the very center of that transformation; by
which must be aligned and consistent with the business architecture of the institutions
of higher education (Castro Benavides et al., 2020). The information (or content or
data) is a key success factor (in addition to human factors, leadership,
processes, the organization, etc., which also require information) (i-scoop, 2018). With

of digital transformation, data governance must be considered as noted
(Abdulfattah & Almaghthawi, 2020), including security, agreements and protection
data, and regulations (Rodrigues, 2017). Also as proposed by Castro Benavides
et al. (2020), the information must be aligned consistently with the architecture76 Digital Transformation in HEIs. Implementation model ation
business of higher education institutions to ensure the effective management of
data transformation and digital adoption of the business.
▪ Business process dimension (PROC)
Digital transformation, being an organizational transformation, allows the
university create, improve and reinvent operational processes, as well as replace
traditional services with digital services that simplify processes
involved in the provision of services reducing operational complexity (Castro
Benavides et al., 2020). Business process optimization is the optimization of
individual business processes within that holistic perspective, and this is what
corresponds to customer-centric optimization needs. The clients and
stakeholders, they should not see silos or internal divisions in the processes, simply
interact with organizations in the context of a business process, and the result
That interaction is what they want to see (i-scoop, 2018). The changes, which are found
largely in the business process, they induce changes in other processes, strategies
and the company as a whole (Krell & Gale, 2005). For example, university digitization
of administrative processes provides unrestricted 24-hour access to the entire
information and services using multiple platforms or digital curricula (Rodrigues,
2017). Likewise, the digital services offered at the level of educational institutions
superior facilitate communication, collaboration and co-creation of value in all
stakeholders (Castro Benavides et al., 2020). On the other hand, process automation
business and data digitization can increase agility in business institutions
higher education, but also significantly increase the risks of
cybersecurity and threat levels (Rodrigues, 2017). From the point of view of the
teaching, the modernization of study plans is promoted to satisfy the
contemporary educational standards and methods, which seek to update the program
educational without the barriers of time and space, as well as the development of
international studies, the search for new ways of delivering content through
digital learning and the expansion of the use of ICT technologies, allowing a
flexible response to the needs of the labor market (Castro Benavides et al., 2020).
Over time, for universities, the 4IR STEM curriculum will need to focus on
emerging technologies (robotics, AI, IoT, nanomaterials, genomics and biotechnology) to
provide a workforce not only capable of developing new applications andChapter 3. Theoretical Framework 77
products, but also capable of interpreting the effects of these technologies on the
society and use their training to provide sustainable and ethical uses of science and
technology (Penprase, 2018).
▪ Dimension Administration (ADMN)
There are strategies that change the content and thus improve the current situation; by
On the other hand, there are strategies that change the context, creating new trajectories and
options for the organization (Amir & Uri, 1986). Transformation strategies
digital acquire the second perspective, they focus on the transformation of products,
processes and organizational aspects due to new technologies (Matt et al., 2015).
Digital transformation understands that structural changes must be carried out,
therefore, leadership and support from top management are required. The source of change
is within the organization, the decision-making process begins with the
emergence of assumptions from a new perspective. This change is triggered
by management behavior, decision-making processes, decision making
and strategic planning. Management in a digital world requires rethinking strategies
of the company, business models and key business drivers for success
(Gurbaxani & Dunkle, 2019). Requires a method that changes the entire context of the
problem and open new projections for the organization (Amir & Uri, 1986).
To apply digital transformation in higher education institutions, it is required
that the rectory is aware that digital transformation is promoted through
decisions and strategies at the business level (G Sandhu, 2018) and that recognizes the
heterogeneity of processes and practices that will improve the overall efficiency of the
university as a whole (Faria & Nóvoa, 2017). The authors Amir & Uri (1986), citing
to Meyer (1979), advised that “Structure, which is initially an accommodation to
environment, eventually becomes an impediment to change and must be altered
fundamentally” (p. 205). This means that organizational hierarchies are

organizational decisions (Schwarzmüller et al., 2018).
On the other hand, it is necessary for IT business leaders to direct the processes of
business reengineering, retrain people, transform services
implementing digital initiatives in an integrated manner and managing the implementation of78 Digital Transformation in HEIs. Deployment model
Digital transformation related to changes in IT infrastructure and its
services (Castro Benavides et al., 2020; Dolganova, 2020). Additionally, the leaders of

the ability to define and lead a digital transformation strategy with a team of
strong, specialized leadership who can confidently explain and implement the
transformation n digital in the institution (Castro Benavides et al., 2020).
▪ Strategic planning dimension (PLAN)
The strategic choices made by leaders are essential to understanding how
Organizations adapt to the environment (Amir & Uri, 1986). With respect to
digital transformation requires a well-planned digital strategy, a roadmap
clear, including the digital transformation framework in which all key actors and
stakeholders can play an active role in shaping a university
that thrives in the digital age (Gobble, 2018; G Sandhu, 2018). For example, in a world
digital, companies must continually align their business structures with the
new technologies to benefit from standardization and automation (Fischer et
al., 2020). The importance of strategic alignment and governance is evident in the
need to establish a digital strategy and ensure agility, collaboration and
digital experience (Fischer et al., 2020). Among the most important tasks to do
operational the roadmap is alignment with the leadership team, the digital director
(CDO), as well as missionary, operational leaders, and the implementation of resources
necessary to comply with it (McKinsey & Company, 2020). In a transformation process
digital, alignment and collaboration must flow between the management and purchasing teams,
digital and business units (Fischer et al., 2020).
On the other hand, changes are costly, therefore the development of
processes that allow minimizing the cost of change (Teece et al., 1997). Some authors
mention the importance of having a budget reserved for digital transformation
(Bendor, 2017). That is, digital transformation requires large investments to
get rid of the past and adopt new and disruptive technologies as well as the support of
adequate resources: IT infrastructure, financing and personnel (Castro Benavides et
al., 2020).Chapter 3. Theoretical Framework 79
3.4.2 Socio-cultural perspective (CULT)
The worldview, culture and digital skills of the community
university (students, teachers, administrative staff and stakeholders) are vital
in the digital transformation process in all organizations, including
universities. Since organizational change is related to people,
processes, strategies, structures and competitive dynamics is where the
most of the challenges and opportunities (Wade, 2015). To understand the transformation
of systems, perhaps first a conceptual transformation is needed that allows
People see the process of social change differently. If the systemic evolution
were seen as a dynamic process, it would be easier to see the objective of the change of the
social systems not as the creation of a static final state, but as a process
continuous of human and social growth. This means that instead of trying to stop the
growth of a social system at a particular stage, people would strive to
participate openly and fully in the natural and inevitable process of the evolution of the
social systems (Elgin & Bushnell, 1977). Consequently, it is important to consider the
change management as a necessary strategy for the success of digital transformation
in higher education institutions (Castro Benavides et al., 2020). This is one
task that must be approached with deep sensitivity and attention to overcome resistance
natural to change (J A Faria & Nóvoa, 2017) to the extent that something is highly
institutionalized will have strong cultural persistence (Lawrence, 2005).
Furthermore, the ability to adapt quickly to change is also highlighted as a
important capacity. Experts have said that agility is more important than
technological skills. The 21st century is about agility, adjustment, adaptation and creation of
new opportunities (Bondar et al., 2017). To ensure the sustainability of the
transformation, companies rely on an open culture that facilitates creativity and
risk taking (Fischer et al., 2020). The human capacity for creative thinking,
Creative behavior and innovation is an important source of change
organizational. This perspective is the most compatible with the choice perspective
strategic or management. The source of change is in the system and capabilities

most crucial skills in the digital age (Schwarzmüller et al., 2018), emphasizing that
Innovations in digital teaching are not only technical innovations, but also
academic, curricular, organizational, and structural innovations. In this sense,
It is perceived that the use of digital educational resources allows new roles for teachers
and students, creating flexible and motivating ways of learning and being more
autonomous and collaborative (Fleacă, 2017). This is how the teacher training unit
becomes an important player in the digital transformation process due to the
important challenge of digital literacy among all actors that requires them
update your skills in the field globally, the principles of education in
the areas of customization, flexible design and integration of various trajectories
educational and labor (Castro Benavides et al., 2020).
3.4.3 Technological and Physical Infrastructure Perspective (TEC)
The fourth industrial revolution is often described as the result of integration and
the combined effects of multiple "exponential technologies", such as intelligence
artificial intelligence (AI), biotechnologies and nanomaterials (Penprase, 2018). The
transformations that occurred within the businesses were focused mainly on
the introduction of internal management information systems, such as planning
enterprise resources (ERP) or customer relationship management (CRM). Today in
day, in addition to these transformations, the university must provide flexible IT,
new business platforms and a strong, scalable operational backbone
as part of an agile digital infrastructure (Nadkarni & Prügl, 2021) to support the
human resources, teaching, innovation, administration, access, opening ofChapter 3. Theoretical Framework 81
market, construction process, society and research (Castro Benavides et al.,
2020). Measuring the benefit obtained from IT cannot be seen from a single point
point of view, and should be considered a matter of properly aligning the objectives
organizational with the implementation and use of IT (Rodríguez-Abitia & Bribiesca-
Correa, 2021). On the other hand, the university must have physical infrastructure to
meet contemporary educational standards and methods (i.e., institutes of
innovation, teaching laboratories, digital training units, buildings,
laboratories for teaching in accordance with digital and innovation scenarios)
(Castro Benavides et al., 2020). An example is presented by Hulla et al. (2019), when raising the
creation of innovation institutes as a very important infrastructure resource
where case study-based training laboratories can operate.4. Empirical Study Design
This chapter addresses the aspects related to the design of the empirical study,
starting with the description of the theoretical model and hypotheses. Also, it is described
the process that was carried out to validate the content of the measuring instrument

and leveraged on the m theoretical arc and analysis carried out in chapter 3. The process of
submission to content validation, carried out by experts, also detailed
in this chapter. This measuring instrument will be applied to obtain the information and
subsequent evaluation of the relationships between the different perspectives (organizational,
socio-cultural and technological) and the maturity of digital transformation in institutions
of higher education. Likewise, the research methodology is proposed:

4.1 Maturity of digital transformation in
higher education institutions
The dynamic and evolutionary nature of digital transformation takes place in the
universities that are impacted by technology. This evolution process is
defined by the digital maturity proposals, it is understood as the state of
digital transformation of a company and describes what a company has already achieved in
terms of carrying out transformation efforts. Although there is no standard approach
To describe the levels of digital maturity (Teichert, 2019), the IDC infodoc (2019) states
that a complete transformation process must incorporate various states of maturity.
Based on the analysis of the different digital maturity models described in Section
3.1, the following levels of digital maturity are created and proposed focused on the
higher education institutions (See Table 4-1).84 Digital Transformation in HEIs. Deployment model

4.2 Organizational perspective, and perspectives
socio-cultural and technological
The importance of the organizational perspective in the process of
digital transformation of higher education institutions. The companies that
wishing to advance the transformation must begin with senior management (Gurbaxani &
Dunkle, 2019). This dimension consolidates most of the determined dimensions that
investigations have had been chosen separately around this perspective, and emerged
mainly four dimensions: business process, administration, information and
governance of digital transformation (Matt et al., 2015; Gobble, 2018; Rossmann &
Reutlingen, 2018; Gurbaxani & Dunkle, 2019; Rosing & Etzel, 2020; Castro Benavides et
al., 2021a;).
Organizational change is related to people, processes, strategies,
competitive structures and dynamics, which is where most of the
challenges and opportunities (Wade, 2015). In particular, the strategy is related to the
organizational capabilities, represents how the organization will respond to changes
of the environment, and thus satisfy customer expectations, respond to the competition,
its essence is to create and use competitive advantage (Chandler, 1992). Currently
require dynamic capabilities, understood as the capacity within
an organization to integrate, build and reconfigure its competencies
internal/external, and thus respond to the changes demanded by a dynamic environment,
flexible, timely, and fast manner (Miranda Torrez, 2017; Teece et al., 1997). In
Consequently, it is important to consider change management as a strategy
necessary for the success of digital transformation in educational institutions
higher (Castro Benavides et al., 2020).
On the one hand, the university must provide flexible IT, new platforms
business and a strong, scalable operational backbone as part of a
agile digital infrastructure (Nadkarni & Prügl, 2021) to support human resources,
teaching, innovation, administration, access, market opening, process
of construction, society and research (Castro Benavides et al., 2020). As well as

will adopt the multiple and diverse systems of technological and educational innovation, while
consider them useful and easy to use (Martín García et al., 2014; Palos-Sanchez et al., 2019;

The fourth industrial revolution is often described as the result of an integration

As a consequence, the university must provide flexible IT, new platforms

agile digital infrastructure (Nadkarni & Prügl, 2021), to support human resources,
teaching, innovation, administration, access, market opening, process of

On the other hand, the university must have physical infrastructure to satisfy the
contemporary educational standards and methods (i.e. innovation institutes,
teaching laboratories, digital training units, buildings, laboratories for
teaching in accordance with the digital and innovation scenario) (Castro Benavides et al.,
2020).

Organizational change is related to people, processes, strategies,

Technological knowledge depends strongly on the social contexts in which it is
develops, depends on many people, on the institutions that interact with it for
a long period of time (Pinch & Bijker, 1984; Valderrama, 2004). Therefore, the
worldview, culture and digital skills of students, teachers,
administrative, stakeholders, are vital in the digital transformation process throughout
organization, including universities.
Within the evolution process of the digital transformation that takes place in the
universities, applied efforts are included to achieve changes from a point of
operational view, as well as acquired meta-skills regarding the process domain
of change (Chanias & Hess, 2016). From a content perspective, the dimensions
Typical covers the (strategic) aspects of transformation management, the core of the
business that includes the offer of digital products and services, the digitalization of
internal processes and operations, digital interaction with the user, as well as the use and
IT development (Chanias & Hess, 2016). These models are particularly relevant
when both the metacapabilities in terms of transformation management and the
Technological changes in products, processes or business models are considered from
a holistic perspective (Chanias & Hess, 2016).
4.5 Theoretical Model and Hypotheses
Higher education institutions are very attentive to the development of the
digital transformation and are trying to change their current paradigm. The current state
of the research lacks a model of theoretical and methodological maturity deep for digital transformation, not only in the IT business but also in the
higher education institutions (Castro Benavides et al., 2020; Gollhardt et al., 2020).
Therefore, based on the analysis carried out on the theoretical framework described in chapter 3, and
The previous sections in this chapter describe and present hypotheses between the
perspectives and corresponding criteria for the implementation of a
digital transformation in higher education institutions. The present study
contemplates three dimensions that could positively influence the maturity of the
Digital transformation in higher education institutions: perspective

management/administration, and strategic planning); socio-cultural perspective; and
technological perspective.
Based on the previous discussion, the following hypotheses are proposed.
H1: Organizational perspective has a direct positive influence on perspective
socio-cultural.
H1a: Organizational perspective has a positive indirect influence on maturity
of the digital transformation of higher education institutions through
socio-cultural perspective.

4.6 Design and Validation of Content
Transformation Measuring Instrument
Digital in Education Institutions

4.6.1 Validity
A commonly accepted definition of the validity of an instrument is the extent to which
the instrument measures what it purports to measure (Slocumb & Cole, 1991). It is also considered
a vital factor in the selection or application of an instrument (Zamanzadeh et al., 2015) and
serves as a guide to determine the appropriate implications of the study findings
(Slocumb & Cole, 1991). Specifically, validity is determined by examining concepts
related to construct, criterion and content validity (Devon, Block, Moyle-
wright, et al., 2007).
Construct validity refers to “how well” an instrument identifies measures.
correct operationalizations for the theoretical concepts under study (Sampieri et al., 2014; Yin,
2009). The criterion validity of a measurement instrument is established by comparing its
results with those of a certain external criterion that tries to measure the same (Sampieri90 Digital Transformation in HEIs. Implementation model
et al., 2014) and finding a statistically significant relationship between a measure and
a criterion (Rubio et al., 2003); and content validity refers to the degree to which the items
of an instrument are a representative sample of the content domain being measured
(Escurra, 1988; Devon, Block, Moyle-Wright, et al., 2007; Magdalena et al., 2015;
Zamanzadeh et al., 2015).
4.6.2 Content Validity
Content validity reveals a full range of the attribute under study (Devon, Block,
Moyle-wright, et al., 2007) in terms of clarity, coherence, relevance and sufficiency of the
dimension item, with respect to a content domain (Carbajal & Tamari, 2017).
To develop a set of scale items, a researcher first defines the
construct of interest and its dimensions searching the literature, through opinions
of experts, carrying out population sampling or through qualitative research
(Devon, Block, Moyle-wright, et al., 2007). On the other hand, content validity can be
characterize as face validity or logical validity. Face validity indicates that the
measure appears to be valid “at first glance.” Logical validity indicates a more process
rigorous, focused on an evaluation provided by expert judges, so that
information can be provided about the representativeness and clarity of the elements and
offer concrete suggestions to improve the quality of the instrument (Rubio et al., 2003;
Zamanzadeh et al., 2015). If experts in the field are perceived as true
experts, it is unlikely that there is a higher authority that questions the assumption
validity of the test content (Lawshe, 1975). In summary, (Escobar-Pérez &
Cuervo-Martínez, 2008) suggests the following categories to evaluate the validity of
content of a measuring instrument: sufficiency, clarity, coherence, relevance; and the
rating scale: does not meet criteria, low level, moderate level, high level.
Finally, numerous analytical techniques have been proposed to quantify the degree of
agreement of experts on the relevance of the content of an instrument. Among the most
used are Aiken's V coefficient (Aiken, 1980), the Validity Index of
Lawshe's Content-CVI (Lawshe, 1975), the Content Validity Index (CVR) and the
Content Validity Coefficient-CVC (Hernandez-Nieto , 2002), and Pedrosa et al.
(2014) detail other techniques. The main ones are described below.Chapter 4. Design of the Empirical Study 91
▪ V of Aiken
Aiken's V coefficient is considered the most relevant statistic to evaluate validity.
of content (Escurra, 1988). Evaluate the relevance of each item with respect to its
construct, but also considers not only the number of categories offered to the judges,
but the number of participating experts. Additionally, the ratings assigned
They can be dichotomous (values ​​of 0 or 1) or polychotomous (values ​​of 0 to 5) (Pedrosa et
al., 2014). The V statistic is calculated using equation (4.1).
𝑋̅−𝑙
𝑉 = (4.1)
𝑘
where 𝑋̅ represents the median of the judges' ratings, 𝑙 represents the value
lowest possible and 𝑘 represents the range of possible values ​​within the scale of
measurement used. The 𝑉 statistic provides an index that goes from 0 to 1. We obtain a
value of 𝑉 equal to 0 when all judges select the lowest possible score,
and a value of 𝑉 equal to 1 when all judges select the highest score
possible (Penfield & Giacobbi, 2004).
Furthermore, the result can be evaluated statistically using the table in the
right tail of associated probabilities and accepting as valid only the elements
which are statistically significant at .05. As shown in Table 4-2, if there are
nine judges and four scale levels, an Aiken V of .74 should be obtained for a
statistical significance level of p < .036 and for the item to be considered valid
(Escurra, 1988).

Furthermore, the calculation of the confidence intervals for this coefficient allows us
contrast whether the magnitude obtained from the coefficient is greater than that established as
minimally acceptable (.70) to conclude the content validity of the items (Juárez-
Hernández & Tobón, 2018). The confidence interval for Aiken's V can be calculated
with equations (4.2) and (4.3). Where L refers to the lower limit and U to the upper limit.

In equations 2 and 3, z corresponds to the standard value of the normal distribution such that
the C% of the distribution area is between -z and z. For example, for an interval of
95% confidence, z = 1.96 (Penfield & Giacobbi, 2004).
▪ Lawshe Content Validity Index (CVI)
Lawshe's Content Validity Index (CVI) determines a quantitative index for
measure the content validity of an instrument. The index requires that expert judges
evaluate whether the skill or knowledge measured by the item is “essential”, “useful, but not
essential” or “not necessary” for the performance of their job (Lawshe, 1975). The CVI is the
average of the values ​​of the items retained by applying the validity relationship of the
content (CVR) proposed by (Lawshe, 1975). The formula to calculate the CVR is:
𝑁
𝐶𝑉𝑅 =
𝑛𝑒−
2 (4.4)
𝑁
2
when 𝑛 = the number of expert judges who agree with the category
𝑒
“essential”, and N = the total number of expert judges.
Lawshe presents this expression to be interpreted as a correlation, since he takes
values ​​from -1 to +1; then, CVR will be negative if less than half of the judges are
agree, CVR is null if exactly half of the participants agree, and
CVR is positive if more than half agree (Magdalena et al., 2015). Chapter 4. Empirical Study Design 93
Additionally, Table 4-3 explained by Lawshe (1975) presents the values
CVR minimums with single-tailed test as p > .05.
▪ Content validity coefficient (CVC)
The Content Validity Coefficient (CVC) is an index that measures the validity of
content based on agreement between judges. The author Hernandez-Nieto (2002) recommends
the participation of three to five expert judges and the use of a Likert scale of five
alternatives. It is calculated with the average of one of the items between the maximum score that
could obtain the item. Consequently, the error assigned to each element is calculated
(Pe). The formula to calculate CVC is:
Yo
CVC = CVC – Pe (4.5)
i i
Likewise, it recommends keeping only those items with a coefficient greater than .80;
while Balbinotti in (Juárez-Hernández & Tobón, 2018) suggests keeping those
items with a coefficient greater than .70. The CVC evaluation scale is presented in
Table 4-3.

Values ​​Interpretation
.00 to .40 Not acceptable
.41 to .60 Very low
.61 to .70 Low
.71 to .79 Moderately low
.80 to .90 Good
.91 to 1.00 Excellent
In the content validity of the instrument, the agreement of the judges must be in the
upper range of the scale (Hernandez-Nieto, 2002; Zamanzadeh et al., 2015).
4.6.3 Consensus between the Judges
An equivalent phrase for consensus (general agreement) might be "the collective opinion of
a group", considering that a certain degree of variation is possible between individuals
(William J. Tastle & Wierman, 2007). On the other hand, dissent is defined as a
difference of opinion, so that conflict occurs within the group involved
in making a decision (William J. Tastle & Wierman, 2007).94 Digital Transformation in HEIs. Deployment model
Within the context of content validation, if revisions are required
important to the measurement of the instrument, the researcher can repeat the process (Rubio
et al., 2003). When the result of the agreement measure is high, it indicates that there is consensus
in the process of classification or assignment of scores among evaluators, equally nte
accounts for the interchangeability of measuring instruments and reproducibility of
the measure (Escobar-Pérez & Cuervo-Martínez, 2008). There are several techniques to determine
This agreement, including Kappa statistics (Bernal-García et al., 2018; Escobar-Pérez
& Cuervo-Martínez, 2008; Hernandez-Nieto, 2002); Kendall’s W (Escobar-Pérez & Cuervo-
Martínez, 2008; Zamora-de-Ortiz et al., 2020), and Wierman (W J Tastle & Wierman, 2006,
2007).
▪ Kappa Statistician
This statistic generates a measure of agreement, it is only used in nominal data; without
However, there is a generalization to include ordinal data called coefficient k
weighted (Escobar-Pérez & Cuervo-Martínez, 2008). The statistic has a range between
-1 and 1, but generally lies between 0 and 1. If the coefficient is 1, it indicates perfect agreement
between the evaluators, if it is 0 it indicates that the agreement is not greater than that expected by the
random, and if the value of the coefficient is negative, the level of agreement is lower than expected by
randomness (Escobar-Pérez & Cuervo-Martínez, 2008).
Kappa values ​​greater than .76 indicate “excellent” agreement, those between
.40 and .75 are defined as “acceptable” agreement and values ​​below .40 are
They consider agreement “poor or unacceptable” (Hernandez-Nieto, 2002). For him
On the contrary, (Cortés-Reyes et al., 2010) suggest another interpretation: “poor or weak” for
Kappa values ​​below .40, “moderate” for values ​​between .41 and .60, “good” between
.61 and .80 and “very good” for higher Kappa values ​​up to 1.
▪ Kendall's W
Kendall's W is a non-parametric rank test that indicates the degree of association
o level of agreement between the average ranges of the evaluations made by judges
experts according to an ordinal scale (Zamora-de-Ortiz et al., 2020).
An interpretation of Kendall's W is presented in Table 4-4. Chapter 4. Design of the Empirical Study 95
Table 4-4: Interpretation of Kendall's W. Taken from (Schmidt, 1997).
Kendall's W Interpretation Classification
.1 ≤ W < .3 Very Weak Consensus None
.3 ≤ W < .5 Low Weak Consensus
.5 ≤ W < .7 Moderate Consensus Moderate
.7 ≤ W < .9 Strong High Consensus
W ≥ .9 Exceptionally strong consensus Very High
▪ Tastle-Wierman consensus
The Tastle-Wierman Consensus is a measure of dispersion used to determine the
consensus and dissent. The measure is applied to a Likert scale (or any scale
ordinal). With this measure, data on ordinal scales can be given a value of
dispersion that is logically and theoretically sound (W J Tastle & Wierman, 2006, 2007;
Villaverde & Kosheleva, 2010). The minimum value that the coefficient assumes is 0 and the maximum
es 1. The authors William J. Tastle & Wierman (2007) have not defined parameters for

end of a full round (Okoli & Pawlows Ki, 2004).
The practical applications of this index can be consulted in studies such as Villaverde
& Kosheleva (2010), W J Tastle & Wierman (2006, 2007).
4.6.4 Expert Judgment
The first objective of content validity is to obtain the opinion of expert judges who
support or reject the appropriate operational definition of the variables within the universe
of conceptual content and reach consensus. To achieve this goal, they have
proposed various consensus methods, such as group methods or by
unique expert methods. You can follow, among others, the aggregate method
individual, the Delphi method, the nominal group technique and the group consensus method
(Corral, 2009). Among the individual techniques is the aggregate method
individual and the Delphi method, both require interaction with experts, but
In the latter, a higher level of agreement is required (Escobar-Pérez & Cuervo-Martínez, 2008),
Likewise, if used systematically and rigorously, this method can contribute
significantly to expand knowledge (Hasson et al., 2000). This study follows the
Delphi method, detailed below.96 Digital Transformation in HEIs. Deployment model
▪ Delphi method
The prospective Delphi method consists of a technique for obtaining information, based
in consulting experts in an area, in order to obtain a consensus opinion and
reliable (López Vidal & Africa Calvo, 2019). Although in the literature, a
exact number of judges, it is recommended to have a group of at least five people
to have sufficient control over the agreement. Each judge carries out the evaluation of the
quantitative and qualitative opinions on the items; After analyzing their answers, the
research team sends the resulting median to each judge, requesting that
reconsider/validate your judgment until you reach a consensus (Escobar-Pérez & Cuervo-Martínez,
2008; Zamanzadeh et al., 2015).
To verify the consensus reached in the responses, the use of the coefficient is suggested
of Tastle-Wierman Consensus. When Consensus > .70, there is good agreement and the
round ends.
▪ Expert Competence Coefficient (K)
One way to select experts is through the analysis of their relevance as
experts by calculating the Expert Competence Coefficient (K) (Mengual-andrés
et al., 2016), using formula (4.6):
1
𝐾 = (𝐾 +𝐾 ) (4.6)
𝑐 𝑎
2
𝐾 is the knowledge or information coefficient that represents a measure of the level of
𝑐
knowledge on the subject. The judge's self-assessment is required on a discrete scale
from 0 to 10, and then multiplied by .1.
𝐾 is the argumentation coefficient or substantiation of the experts' criteria.
𝑎
The judge evaluates himself by addressing six possible sources of argument (Cruz Ramírez &
Martínez Cepena, 2019) (See Table 4-5). Chapter 4. Design of the Empirical Study 97

After obtaining the final value, experts with a score lower than .8 are not included in

The following section provides a detailed description of the systematic process and is
analyze the results obtained.
4.6.5 Method
This is a quantitative-non-experimental descriptive study. During the process
collected the qualitative and quantitative points of view of expert judges regarding the
research topic following the methodology proposed by (Hasson et al., 2000).
▪ Study Design
A web-based Delphi process was developed to involve expert judges and
validate the content of the measurement instrument with respect to the implementation of the
digital transformation in higher education institutions.
The steps were followed: (a) Preparation of instructions and spreadsheets, (b) Commitment
with experts - Delphi Method, and (c) Collection and analysis of results.
o Preparation of instructions and spreadsheets
Prior to developing the instrument, a review of the literature was carried out that allowed
identify twenty-nine (29) items, grouped mainly into four (4) dimensions.
Twelve (12) of them belonging to the organizational perspective (41.37%), seven (7)
belonging to the socio-cultural perspective (24.13%), five (5) that represent the
technological perspective (17.24%), and five (5) related to the maturity of the
digital transformation in higher education institutions (17.24%) (See Annex A).98 Digital Transformation in HEIs. Deployment model
Subsequently, so that the information was collected in an operable form, the items
were adjusted and organized in an appropriate format and sequence (Zamanzadeh et al.,
2015). Furthermore, the instructions to the judges about the dimensions and the indicator that
measures each item or group of items were explained in detail through a video, a
cover letter and written documents, suggested by (Escobar-Pérez & Cuervo-
Martínez, 2008). Finally, the study respected ethical considerations such as
acceptance, permission to use and safeguard the information provided by the judges
experts.
o Selection of Experts. Delphi method
The sample selection was non-probabilistic, purposeful and critical (Taherdoost et al.,
2016), according to the interest in participating in the study, knowledge about the topic
of digital transformation in higher education institutions, experience and
availability. Some experts were contacted through emails electronic
available in the different scientific articles on digital transformation, and others
recognized experts in different countries. Initially a list of thirty-five was designed.
two (32) potential judges, each of whom received a cover letter and
invitation to take part in the evaluation trial; eleven (11) judges accepted. It was requested
to the expert judges who responded to the self-assessment that meets the requirements
described in Section 4.6.4.2. to calculate the Expert Competence Coefficient
(K); Finally, the nine (9) experts with a K rating greater than
.8.
o Preparation
The process was created with a criterion of seeking the participation of expert judges from
different geographical regions and with heterogeneous experience. The Delphi method consisted
of a total of nine (9) judges: four (4) doctors, five (5) systems engineers or
electricians, who serve as professors (5), deans (1), or directors of
innovation (3) in higher education institutions. The group of experts also
reflected a diversity of opinions with varied geographical representation, of the countries
from Colombia (5), Spain (1), Portugal (1), Guatemala (1) and Germany (1).Chapter 4. Design of the Empirical Study 99
The role of the expert judges was to review these indicators and establish the level of
agreement on the relevance, coherence, clarity and sufficiency of each item with respect to the
construct to which it belongs.
o Data Collection
The survey was conducted through the SurveyMonkey web application. The Delphi method is
took place between October and November 2021. It began with the formal invitation to be
part of the group of expert judges, while the information on the design of the
study and the link to enter the website was sent to them by email. HE
asked the judges who accepted the invitation to respond within three weeks
after receiving the email. It is worth mentioning that communication and
Evaluation by the experts occurred asynchronously. Up to two were sent
reminders to participants who did not complete the survey within the specified time frame,
and finally the survey was closed after two months, with very significant contributions,
complete and detailed information provided by the nine (9) judges.
The survey included four (4) sections. The first contained information about the study,
and the self-assessment required to calculate the K Coefficient. The second concerned data
c
identification of the future evaluator. The third described the main characteristics and
dimensions of the university with their respective items, along with the details of the
characteristics of each construct, scientific relevance and indicators to qualify each
item. Finally, the fourth section collected information from the judges' self-assessment
to calculate the Argumentation Coefficient K. Furthermore, each The section offered fields
to
free text for observations that the judges would like to express.
In this round and for each indicator, the experts had to indicate their agreement or disagreement
on a 4-level Likert-type scale (Not Compliant, Low Level, Moderate Level, High Level),
according to sufficiency, clarity, coherence and Relevance.
The analysis was carried out with Microsoft Excel and R-Studio applying the Consensus.100 Digital Transformation in HEIs function. Deployment model
▪ Statistical Analysis of the Data
Two statistics were applied to the set of responses provided by the judges.
Specifically, Aiken's V (Escurra, 1988), and the Tastle-Consensus coefficient
Wierman (W J Tastle & Wierman, 2006).
o Consensus between Judges. Tastle-Wierman Consensus
A Tastle-Wierman Consensus value greater than or equal to .7 would indicate that a
strong consensus, and the expert round would be finalized. However, if the value is less
a .7, the survey must be sent again to the expert judges, starting a new
iteration. In each iteration, the following information would be returned for each item: 1. The
average item rating for judges; 2. The qualification that the judge gave him
to the item in the previous round; 3. An indication of the current level of consensus, based on the
Tastle-Wierman Consensus coefficient value; and 4. A paragraph that summarizes the
comments from other participants about why they evaluated that item. With base
In this, participants review and/or adjust their ratings for each item with their
respective observations (Okoli & Pawlowski, 2004).
or V-Aiken
The modifications made to the items by the researchers are made
based on the observations of the expert judges and the results of Aiken's V,
considering that the item is maintained if the value of Aiken's V is greater than or equal to .74;
otherwise, it is modified or deleted.
The desired result is a trend towards 1, and new rounds can be carried out if in the
first round the minimum value of .7 is not reached in the judges' agreement, nor a value
greater than .74 in Aiken's V coefficient with statistical significance of .036.

According to Table 4-6, nine (9) judges were identified who met the
selection criteria presented at the beginning of the study, that is, a coefficient ient K greater than or
equal to .8, classified as influential.
▪ Content Validity Coefficient and Consensus among Judges
Once the coefficients per item, per dimension and per instrument have been calculated (Annex B),
Adequate levels are deduced in the Aiken V Coefficient for most of the items,
validating its content, except for item 4, whose Clarity indicator (V = .63) and
for the Sufficiency indicator of the Business Processes subdimension (V = .70).
Regarding the consensus among the judges, calculated with the Consensus coefficient, it is
observes a value greater than or equal to .78 in most of the items of the instrument, indicating
“Strong Consensus.” The exceptions are Clarity of item 3 (Consensus = .57);
Coherence (V = .60), Relevance (Consensus = .65), and Clarity (Consensus = .54) of the
item 4; Business Process Sub-dimension (Organizational Dimension) Sufficiency
(Consensus = .66); Strategic Planning Sub-Dimension (Organizational Dimension)
Sufficiency (Consensus = .65); Clarity of item 11 (Consensus = .65); Clarity of item 13
(Consensus = .66); Relevance (Consensus = .50) and Item Clarity (Consensus = .57) 20;
and in item 24, all the indicators (Coherence, Relevance, Clarity) (Consensus = .57).
The analysis of content validity and consensus between judges of the entire instrument was
presented in Table 4-7. It is observed that, in all cases, the Aiken V coefficient is
greater than .74 with p < .05, which indicates that the items are considered valid; in addition,
For all dimensions there is consensus greater than .74 among all judges, indicating 102 Digital Transformation in HEIs. Deployment model
“Strong Consensus.” On the other hand, the evaluation indicator of Clarity in the Dimension

In response to feedback provided by experts, changes were made
qualitative in the wording of the questions and some of the context was modified to finalize
the design of the questionnaire.
In conclusion, the study of the validity of an instrument is a costly process that
It requires time to plan and execute. In that order, the first critical step to
carried out must be the study of content validity, because this analysis verifies
that the instruments used for the studies are appropriate for the c onstruct, the
population being investigated and the socio-cultural context in which the study is immersed.
Since content validity is a prerequisite for other types of validity, it must
have top priority during the development of the instrument.
In content validity studies, researchers can receive information
invaluable from expert judges who provide constructive feedback on the quality of
the newly developed measures and the objective criteria with which they must evaluate each
element (Rubio et al., 2003). Consequently, the analysis of the consolidated results
of the instrument through the Aiken and Consensus V coefficients indicates that the
instrument has content validity and that there is a strong consensus among the judges;
therefore, a second round was not required. On the contrary, values ​​that do not

lower than .7 in the Consensus coefficient were carefully reviewed by the Chapter 4. Design of the Empirical Study 103
researchers, and reflecting the observations provided by the expert judges, the
wording and context to facilitate understanding of the item. Accepting the suggestion
of the expert judges, items 20 and 21 of the technological dimension were merged into a
single item.
Consequently, the evaluation of the instrument described in this work facilitates obtaining
of scientifically valid and reliable results, to validate the relationships between the
constructs (organizational, socio-cultural and technological) that impact the transformation
digital in higher education institutions (Castro Benavides et al., 2022).5. Results of the Empirical Study

5.2 Structural Equation Model and Analysis
5.2.1 Constructs and Indicators
A digital transformation survey is used in higher education institutions
to address research questions and hypotheses, creating key variables
necessary for the analysis (Castro Benavides et al., 2022) and indicators that are measured in
a five-point Likert scale (1= no degree, 2= low degree, 3= moderate degree,
4=high degree, 5=very high degree). Based on the literature reviewed in chapter 3, the
The survey was structured in two sections and nine (9) international experts evaluated
its content validity using the Delphi Method. The first section contains fourteen
(14) items related to the main characteristics of the university and the
interviewed. The second section is related to the main perspectives. There is
four (4) constructs that are operationalized as compon perspective entities
organizational (ORG): information (INF), administration (ADMN), planning (PLAN) and
process (PROC). A total of twelve (12) indicators were measured. Additionally, it

cultural (CULT); Then, a total of five (5) items or variables observed as
components of the technological perspective (TEC); and finally, a total
of five (5) items or observed variables of digital transformation maturity
(DT_MADUREZ) (See Annex A).118 Digital Transformation in HEIs. Deployment model
5.2.2 Analytical Approach
The PLS-SEM method allows the estimation of complex models that include several
constructs, indicator variables and structural trajectories without imposing assumptions of
distribution over the data. Additionally, it has great statistical power, which
means that by applying PLS-SEM it is more likely that relationships will be identified as
significant when they are in fact present in the population (Hair et al., 2018).
As PLS-SEM is a causal-predictive approach to SEM, it is the appropriate method for the
research when its objective is the prediction and confirmation of theory (Dash & Paul,
2021; Hair et al., 2019). Additionally, PLS-SEM should be selected when a population
small restricts the sample size (Hair et al., 2019).
This study used a Higher Order Model or Hierarchical Component Models
(HCM) that involve testing second-order structures containing two layers of
components. In the present study, the higher order construct referring to
Organizational Perspective (ORG) is composed of lower order reflective constructs
(INF, ADMN, PROC, PLAN). Similarly, lower order constructs have a
reflective measurement model. The other constructs of the model such as: CULT, TEC
and DT_MADUREZ are reflective. Following the steps described by (Hair et al., 2019), the
The first step evaluation begins with the examination of the measurement models, and in
Secondly, the structural model is evaluated.
5.3 Evaluation of the Measurement and Structural Model
5.3.1 Evaluation of the Measurement Model
First of all, it is necessary to create the construct with the Scores of the order construct
superior ORG, its respective components and indicators. Researchers must
apply a combination of the repeated indicators approach and the use of Scores
latent variables in a two-phase HCM analysis (Hair et al., 2017). In the first phase
(See Figure 5-9), the repeated indicator approach is used to obtain the scores
of the latent variables for the Lower Order Components (LOC). In the second
phase, LOC scores serve as latent variables in the measurement model of
Higher Order Component (HOC) (see Figure 5-10). When you apply the
analysis to the two-phase HCM, the HOC is integrated into the nomological network in such a way thatC Chapter 5. Results of the Empirical Study 119
allows other latent variables (not part of the HOC) as predecessors
explain part of their variance. Two-phase HCM analysis can identify relationships
of significant paths that would not otherwise be found (F. Hair et al., 2017).
Figure 5-9: Higher Order Construct (ORG). Internal Model (Path Coefficients),
External Loads (Outer Loadings) and Constructs R2120 Digital Transformation in HEIs. Deployment model
Figure 5-10: Structural Model with path and R2 Coefficients
The evaluation of the reflective measurement model is carried out through: 1) the
internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha and composite reliability); 2) convergent validity
(indicator reliability and average variance extracted AVE, 3) discriminant validity
(Fornell-Larcker criterion) and cross loadings between indicators and latent variables and the
Heterotrait-Monotrail (HTMT) ratio (Cepeda Carrión & Roldán Salgueiro, 2003).
Internal consistency: Cronbach's alpha is a measure of consistency reliability
internal that assumes similar thresholds, but produces lower values ​​than the reliability
composite (Hair et al., 2019). Additionally, Cronbach's alpha is only applicable to
latent variables with reflective indicators (Cepeda Carrión & Roldán Salgueiro, 2003).
Higher values ​​indicate higher levels of reliability, and values ​​of .95 and higher
High values ​​are considered problematic, as they indicate that the items are redundant, which
reduces construct validity. All latent variable measures indicate reliability
of internal consistency in the measurement model (See Table 5-3).
Convergent Validity: The metric used to evaluate the convergent validity of a
construct is the average variance extracted (AVE) for all items of each construct.
An acceptable AVE is .50 or higher, which establishes that more than 50% of the Chapter 5. Results of the Empirical Study 121
variance of the construct is due to its indicators (Hair et al., 2019). All the sizes
of the construct are greater than .50. (See Table 5-3).

• The factor loadings of the indicators: the evaluation of the measurement model implies
examine factor loadings. The high values ​​in the factor loadings reveal that the
indicators associated with the construct have much in common. The value of the factor loading
It is also called indicator reliability. Loads greater than .708 are recommended,
since they indicate that the construct explains more than 50% of the variance of the indicator, which
provides acceptable reliability of the items (Hair et al., 2019). However, instead
To automatically eliminate indicators < .708, researchers must examine undermine
carefully examine the effects of item deletion on composite reliability, as well
as on the average extracted variance of the corresponding latent variable. In
Generally, indicators with external loads between .40 and .70 should be considered for
removal of the scale only when the removal of the indicator leads to an increase
in composite reliability (or average variance extracted) (Hair et al., 2017). In
Consequently, item CUL06 (.698) was eliminated from the scale because doing so increases
significantly the composite reliability. Other PROCs were maintained: .668 and P-
TEC_01: .616, as shown in Figure 5-10.
Discriminant Validity: Traditionally the Fornell and Larcker criterion is used to
evaluate discriminant validity; However, the authors (Henseler et al., 2015)
demonstrate that neither the Fornell-Larcker criterion nor the evaluation of cross loadings
allow users of variance-based SEM to determine discriminant validity
of their measures, and propose a new approach called HTMT. If the HTML value is
below .90, discriminant validity is established between two reflective constructs
(Hair et al., 2017). The results show that the HTMLT discriminant validity values
for all constructs they are less than .90 (See Table 5-4).122 Digital Transformation in HEIs. Deployment model

As an additional analysis, the cross loading values ​​confirm that the indicator
has its highest loading value with the construct to which it is assigned (See Table 5-5).

5.3.2 Evaluating the Structural Model
In the first instance, the model's prediction capacity is determined, and subsequently
It evaluates the extent to which exogenous variables contribute to the explained variance of
the endogenous variables. The evaluation criteria that must be considered are:
Coefficient of determination (R2), which represents the predictive power of the sample,
because it is the squared correlation of the actual and predictive values; Likewise
must calculate the redundancy and communality index using Stone-cross validation.
Gleisser Q2, this measure is an indicator of predictive power that measures how well they are
reconstructed the values ​​by the model and its estimated parameters; and the significance and
relief statistical analysis of the path coefficients (Hair et al., 2017, 2019) that analyzes
the relationships between the constructs through the values ​​obtained from the coefficients
standardized paths. Additionally, researchers should evaluate the predictive power outside Chapter 5. Results of the Empirical Study 123
of their model sample using the PLSpredict procedure described in (Shmueli et
al., 2016).
Before evaluating the structural relationships of the model, collinearity must be examined.
This verification makes it possible to ensure that there are no biases in the results of the
regression (Hair et al., 2019). Although collinearity is evaluated between formative indicators,
in reflective models they are used to check if there are critical levels of collinearity
between the sets of predictor variables. Therefore, the values ​​of the
variance inflation factor (VIF) (Hair et al.,
2017;2019).
Collinearity – VIF: values ​​above 5 are indicative of possible problems of
collinearity between the predictor constructs (Joseph F. Hair et al., 2019). All the
VIF values ​​are less than 5.0 (Table 5-6). In that sense, there are no problems of
collinearity in the model.

Explanatory power: It is required to examine the R2 value of the endogenous constructs. The R2
measures the variance that is explained in each of the endogenous constructs and, therefore, is
a measure of the explanatory power of the model. The R2 varies between 0 and 1, and the R2 values ​​of
.75, .50, and .25 can be considered substantial, moderate, and weak, respectively
(Joseph F. Hair et al., 2019). The results indicate that 86.5% of the variability of
CULT is explained by ORG and TEC. 71.8% of the TEC variability is explained by
ORG. Specifically, 52.7% of the variability in DT_MADUREZ is given by CULT, TEC and
ORG (See Table 5-7). From this criterion, it can be said that the CULT construct has
substantial explanatory power, and the proposed TEC and DT_MATURITY constructs
They have moderate explanatory power.124 Digital Transformation in HEIs. Deployment model

R2 Adjusted R2 Observation
CULT .865 .857 Predictive power Substantial
DT_MATURITY .527 .496 Predictive power Moderate
TEC .726 .718 Predictive power Moderate
Predictive Power: Another means of evaluating the predictive accuracy of the path PLS model is
calculate the value of Q2. This measure is based on the blindfolding technique, which uses a
subset of the available data to estimate the model parameters and then
predict missing data. Q2 examines whether a model accurately predicts data not
used in the estimation of the model parameters (Noreña, 2020). The small ones
differences between predicted and original values results translate into a higher Q2 value
high, indicating greater predictive accuracy (Hair et al., 2019). In the model
structural, Q2 values ​​greater than zero for an endogenous latent variable
reflective indicates the predictive relevance of the model for a dependent construct in
particular; Q2 values ​​greater than .25 and .50 represent predictive relevance
small, medium and large of the PLS-path model (Hair et al., 2019). According to the
Table 5-8, the latent variable CULT has a great relevance of predictive power, while
that the relevance of predictive power based on endogenous latent variables of
DT_MATURITY and TEC is classified as average.

Additionally, researchers should examine statistical prediction. When
interpret the results of PLSpredict, one should focus on the endogenous constructs
key within the model, rather than examining the prediction errors of all
indicators of endogenous constructs (Hair et al., 2019). The reference point that
It is recommended that a linear regression model (LM) be used to generate predictions for
the manifest variables (VM), a set of k = 2 is established as a parameter. Then, Chapter 5. Results of the Empirical Study 125
applying the suggestions or guidelines of Shmueli et al. (2016), it is shown that, in the majority
of the cases (10 VM) the values ​​of Q2 are greater than zero and the minority of
predict
indicators (2 VM) higher prediction errors occur compared to the
LM benchmark. This indicates that the model has a medium predictive power (See Table 5-9)
(Hair et al., 2019).

Once the explanatory and predictive power of the model has been verified, the final step is to evaluate
the statistical significance and relevance of the path coefficients.
Statistical significance.
Significance of path coefficients:
It is necessary to run bootstrapping to evaluate the importance of the path and
evaluate their values, which are generally in the range of -1 and +1 (Hair et al.,
2019). When running bootstrapping with 5000 bootstraps to obtain the path coefficients
and their importance, values ​​are generated for the t-value tests and for the levels of
probability (p-value) for all trajectories of the structural model (Table 5-10). The
Model trajectories are significant with a p-value < .05 or a t-value > 1.96. In it
In the case of the proposed structural model, the correlations between the TEC-variables
>DT_MADURITY indicate a t-value below 1.96. The remaining values ​​are
significant at .05. The calculation results indicate four levels of probability
less than .05 (CULT -> DT_MADUREZ, ORG->CULT, ORG->TEC and TEC->CULT). By
Therefore, the four trajectories are significant with a probability level greater than 126 Digital Transformation in HEIs. Deployment model

Mediating Variables.
The mediating variables absorb part of the relationship between an exogenous construct and
endogenous in the PLS path model through the indirect effect, which is the relationship
between the exogenous latent construct and the mediating variable and between the mediating variable
and the endogenous latent construct. Therefore, the mediating variables reveal the
"true" relationship between an exogenous construct and an endogenous one (Hair et al., 2014). For
evaluate if there is mediation and if it is total or partial, the direct and indirect effects are evaluated
and totals according to the methodology described by Hair et al., (2014).
• Total mediation: Occurs when the mediated (indirect) effect is significant
but the associated direct effect is not. Therefore, the mediating variable explains
completely the relationship between an exogenous (independent) variable and a
endogenous (dependent). It is also called indirect mediation only.
(Noreña, 2020).
• Partial Mediation: Occurs when a mediating variable explains
partially the relationship between an exogenous construct and an endogenous one (Noreña,
2020).
The algorithm that was followed to evaluate the mediating variables of the model is described
in Figure 5-11. The procedure includes the analysis of the explained variance (VAF, for example).

• H1a: The indirect effect of ORG through CULT on DT_MATURITY is significant
and positive. H1a is then supported; Additionally, the VAF of 57% reveals that the
relationship between ORG and DT_MATURITY is partially mediated by CULT.
• H1b: There is no significant indirect effect from ORG through TEC to DT_MATURITY.
Therefore, there is no mediation between ORG and DT_MATURITY by TEC.

H2a is then supported; Additionally, the VAF of 42% reveals that the relationship between
ORG and CULT is partially mediated by TEC.

report the estimated path coefficients. This adds a dimension to the analysis,
considering the mean values ​​of the scores of the latent variables (Hair et al.,
2017). That is, IPMA compares the total effects of the structural model on a
specific construct (in this case DT_MATURITY) with the average of the scores of
the latent variables of the predecessors of this construct (Hair et al., 2017; Noreña,
2020).Chapter 5. Results of the Empirical Study 129

Firstly, one of the main contributions of this work lies in confirming
that digital transformation in higher education institutions must be addressed
as an organizational transformation, and in that sense, be considered and aligned
from three different perspectives (organizational, socio-cultural and technological) to achieve
synchronize digital transformation in a holistic and evolutionary integration over the course
weather.
Secondly, research applied to public universities in Colombia,
Through the implementation model, it shows that the digital transformation is presented
progressively, through maturity levels (none, low, moderate, high,
very high), evidencing how this transformation generates changes in vision and meaning
within higher education institutions, impacting their culture, policies,
administrative and training activities, evaluation processes, pedagogical approaches,
teaching, research, and extension processes; as well as people immersed in
she. It is a profound change that goes beyond the fact of introducing information technologies.
Indus Tria 4.0 is a paradigm shift.
Thirdly, from the descriptive analysis carried out it can be said that the majority of
Colombia's public universities (62%) are located at a level of maturity
moderate, which implies that for universities the digital transformation begins to
be a latent concern, where they are analyzing their vision and considering making
an internal change, as well as a change in their medium-term university objectives. By

of the transformation. Consequently, the investment and use of new technologies becomes
With precaution. Likewise, it can be said that its staff (students, teachers,
administrative) has moderate digital skills, and there is still evidence of resistance to
change in the face of digital transformation processes.
Fourthly, it is clear that without adequate conceptual development, science could not
proceed beyond a certain stage (Lewin, 1947), as the motivation for this research
some theoretical and practical implications are derived (See Figure 6-1).
Figure 6-1: Implementation model of digital transformation in institutions
of higher education.
From the analysis of the structural model, in conclusion, the organizational decisions
directly impact the socio-cultural and technological aspects, and indirectly
impact the maturity of digital transformation. On the other hand, they exhibit an impact
positive from the technological perspective in the maturity levels of the transformation
digital mediated by the socio-cultural perspective. Likewise, the organizational perspective
influences the socio-cultural and technological dimensions, and only the socio-cultural aspects
They directly influence the maturity levels of digital transformation.
In this sense, the present study makes a contribution to the theory by providing evidence
empirical evidence of the importance of integrating the organizational, socio-cultural and
technology in order to improve the level of maturity of the digital transformation in the
higher education institutions. Likewise, it is confirmed that the decisions and
organizational commitments (Information; Missionary processes, Conclusions 133
administration/management, and support; Administration; Strategic planning) from the
high levels of university management have a concrete impact on promotion within
the maturity levels of digital transformation within the institutions of
higher education. Additionally, the results suggest that universities
should consider injecting their digital transformation efforts into improving
socio-cultural strategies in place r to maximize technology.
Fifthly, it is considered pertinent to highlight that this research achieved

that are dispersed throughout the national territory. Result that allows you to have
a holistic view of the maturity of digital transformation in public universities
In colombia.
Finally, based on the previous reasoning, we consider that the model of
implementation created is a relevant reference framework for universities, since
contributes to improving the understanding and management of digital transformation processes that
take place inside. Likewise, it is worth highlighting the importance of the instrument of
digital transformation proposed as a diagnostic and planning tool

moderators that have not been considered in this study and that could help the
understanding of complex resulting relationships. For example, geographic area, date
founding of the educational institution, cultural context, among others.
New research should focus on an update and analysis of the model of
digital transformation of universities in the face of the new scenarios deployed in
the period of the pandemic and post-pandemic, because this research focused its
analysis in a transition time, that is, a before and during. Similarly, to
beginning of the investigation, it was established as the main basis for the identification of the void
of knowledge and construction of the theoretical framework, the systematic review of literature in
scientific databases. Future research could integrate new perspectives from
other sources of information such as reports from prestigious consulting firms

Likewise, based on the implementation model created, it is suggested to generate new
models that link the relationship of the third, fourth and fifth helix through the
digital transformation in universities.
It is proposed to carry out future studies that include the application of mixed methods of
research that facilitate addressing broader research questions that

such that it can be deepened in its theorization, as well as in concrete strategies for its
evaluation and application.
6.2 Limitations of the Study/Process/Instrument
of Measurement
There are some limitations that need to be noted. First, the instrument to measure
digital transformation focused on higher education institutions, being a
first instrument created, new studies, variables and/or relationships could emerge
particular to the contexts of each region/country, that have not been considered and that
may eventually modify the relationships raised in the model.
Secondly, the absence of previous studies that address the issue of creation of
instruments for measuring digital transformation in higher education institutions136 Digital Transformation in HEIs. Deployment model
limits its comparative evaluation. Therefore, there is a need to carry out
additional research to be improved later.
Thirdly, the creation of the model is directed to the context of the HEIs and the population
The study only included public universities in Colombia.
Finally, it is important to clarify that the completion of the thesis work had different
moments that included the analysis of literature until 2019 (date on which
publishes the article that is considered to date a bibliographical reference in
similar digital transformation work). The creation of the applied instrument
later and which gave rise to the analysis of the context under study IES, was created in
the year 2021, and its application dates back to the year 2022, with conclusive data regarding the state
of the art of digital transformation processes in HEIs. In reason
To this, our study and contribution to the knowledge of the development of digital transformation,
presents time limitations associated with the period in which it was developed

Summary
This document presents the result of the research about the relationship between the
new digital technologies associated with Digital Transformation and Company Performance
organizations. The relationship is established through the construction of a model
conceptual based on a systematic literature review (RSL) in the theory of

Abstract
This document presents the result of the research about the relationship between the new
digital technologies associated with Digital Transformation and the Performance of
organizations. Relationship determined through the construction of a conceptual model
based on a systematic literature review, in the theory of Dynamic Capabilities (DC) and the
contribution of some methodologies, experiments and analyzed validations of resource-
based vision theories (RBV) and knowledge based vision (KBV).
The research includes the conceptual recapitulation in the theoretical framework of the
topics associated with the proposed theme, the systematic review of the literature (RSL),
the design of the conceptual model and hypothesis, the conduct of a survey and analysis,
the validation of the model and the analysis of results.
As main results, it is shown that research has paid little attention to the factors that
encourage or hinder digital and technological changes in organizations, to take advantage
of digital transformation and especially big data analytics. However, today's companies seek
to optimize data-based processes, generating value in business and decision making.
It is concluded, that the processes of organizations function, as phenomena that have
objective realities, which can be expressed in causal relationships and measured by means
of data, on many occasions in real time, that produce knowledge as a key element in the
generation of value in the organizations
With which, and through the model developed, it is possible to identify that, digital
transformation and organizational performance can be represented through relationships
between independent and dependent variables of organizations, in which it is possible to
evaluate the contribution and reliability of each variable in the constructs and hypotheses
established for each causal relationship.

The importance of digitalization in organizations goes beyond transformation
digital and must be focused on the use of technology to generate value in business
and in decision making, which allows data to be used in the different processes
starting from improving the organizational capacity and mentality associated with the proper use of
information. The generation of value and the contribution to assertive decision making through
of data use requires the use of digital technologies, in order to give way to forms
data-centric work processes, according to (B. Anand & Krishna, 2019).
Digital transformation is based on advances in digital technologies that have

business, organizational structures, products and services within a market with greater
environmental volatility, complexity and uncertainty.
This requires agile and continuous change management processes to face the challenges.
strategic aspects of digital transformation. It could be noted that “digital transformation is
a continuous process of strategic renewal that uses advances in technologies
digital technologies to develop capabilities that update or replace the business model,
collaborative approach and the culture of an organization” (Warner & Wäger, 2019). The success of
Digital transformation depends on changes in process and operations management
and trained professionals are required in a change process that takes into account the
challenges of digital technologies (Reis, Amorim, Melao, & Matos, 2018).
Organizations seek to use digital technologies to increase sales of
integrated products and services, increase your productivity through solutions
innovations and data management about your interactions with products and services. This
requires new forms of collaboration between distributed networks of actors and creates
dependencies between actors whose interests may not be fully
aligned. Likewise, it requires an organizational transformation from the strategy of

capabilities of professionals (Pereira, Durão, Fonseca, Ferreira, & Moreira, 2020; Vial,
2019).
Organizations are aware of the need for digital transformation to avoid

This strategy will affect the organization as a whole (Pereira et al., 2020; Reis et al.,
2018; Schallmo, Williams, & Boardman, 2017; Warner & Wäger, 2019).
This transformation of data-centric ways of working presents challenges
associated with different areas of the organization, such as people, processes and
technology. Some Two of these are defined in (B. Anand & Krishna, 2019):
● People: Restructuring of organizational competencies and management of the
cultural change
● Processes: Complexity of project delivery across multiple
organizations in the supply chain, the shift from documents to data and
impact on business models that deliver content based on
documents.
● Technology: data standards and transfer protocols, integration of
plug-and-play tools and standalone IT solutions

In recent decades, the value of IT, Big Data and competitive advantage in

Wamba, Akter, Dubey, & Childe, 2017; McAfee & Brynjolfsson, 2012)
RBV has been used to evaluate IT capabilities and it is shown that competitive advantage
of the company is achieved by implementing and using different, valuable and
inimitable (Ji-fan Ren et al., 2017). KBV explores the potential of a company to acquire
competitiveness in a dynamic market context. DC theory can solve the
problem of maintaining a competitive advantage in turbulent environments (Côrte-Real et al.,
2017).
In a globalized and competitive market, the organization must update and reconfigure

ability to respond to change (Merendino et al., 2018). Big data is part of the
digital transformation and can improve the efficiency of internal operations, improve the
control of process performance, monitor the performance of tangible resources
and intangibles, and identify bottlenecks in production processes, inefficiencies in
the use of the machine and the waste of resources (Rialti, Marzi, Ciappei, & Busso, 2019).
This requires operational flexibility of processes, IT systems and
Big Data applications to support change and understand how transformation
Digital can improve the performance of organizations (Côrte-Real et al., 2017).
Therefore, companies must make decisions and seek to optimize processes based
in data. Companies must define changes in processes, functions, culture
organizational and professional capabilities of the organization to be able to adapt to the
decision-making operation schemes based on real-time information and
improve your performance.
In the Colombian context, companies in the electric energy sector have advanced
joint actions through the Colombia Inte initiative ligent, made up of
different companies (XM, EPM, CODENSA, EMCALI, CELSIA, EPSA, ELECTRICARIBE,
EEB, ISAGEN), technological development centers (CIDET, CINTEL) and sectoral entities
(CNO, CAC, COCIER), with the leadership of the Mining and Energy Planning Unit
(UPME) and the sponsorship of the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB). Actions like

Inteligente, 2016), is considered a fundamental input for decision making
with respect to government policies, adjustments to the regulatory framework, articulation of actors
and prioritization of actions in the adoption of new technologies, research and
incentives.

real-time knowledge for the processes of electrical sector organizations.
This requires a transformation in companies, such as changes in structure,
culture, strategies and processes that facilitate the implementation and use of the
digitization of organizations in the sector.
Finally, it can be seen that little attention has been paid to the factors that encourage u
hinder digital and technological changes in organizations, to take advantage of the
digital transformation and especially Big Data analytics (Rialti et al., 2019; Rialti, Marzi,
Silic, & Ciappei, 2018). This problem requires better exploration of the potential effects
of digital transformation in the organization where the relationship between

In conclusion, the development and application of digital technologies in the electrical network allow

implementation strategies and mechanisms, have qualified professionals and
tools necessary for the execution of a digital transformation in the company.
This process must be evaluated taking into account that the organization may change in its
vision, business model, way of relating to customers and considering the
behavior of professionals and organizational culture.
The present final work corresponds to a research that aims to establish
a relationship between new digital technologies associated with digital transformation and the
performance of organizations, based on the construction of a conceptual model
based on a systematic review of the literature (RSL), of the RBV, DC and KBV theories,
considering the methodologies, experiments and validations found in RSL.
The study is based on a positivist research approach that assumes that the world of
phenomena have an objective reality that can be expressed in causal relationships and
be measured in data. Therefore, the significance of the present study, in the advancement of the
field of the theory of administration and management of organizations, lies in identifying the
importance of the relationship between the management of organizations, decision making and

1.1 Digital Transformation (DT)
Digital technologies allow us to generate products, services, business models and
organizational forms through the use of ICT from generating management capabilities
and use of digital information for decision making to face a competitive market
and changing (Andriushchenko et al., 2020). These industrial technologies have a
potential to generate new technological developments, significant improvements in
optimization of processes and their performance, but evaluation of
risk management, technological innovation, generating capabilities of professionals to
use the technology and implementation strategy of digital transformation in the
company. Therefore, it can be said that digital transformation (DT) is b handle on the
ability to use digital information in real time to optimize internal processes and
external from the informed decision making by the organization
(Andriushchenko et al., 2020; Warner & Wäger, 2019).
Schallmo defines “DT includes the creation of networks of actors such as companies and customers in
all segments of the value-added chain, and the application of new technologies.
DT requires skills that involve data extraction and sharing, as well as
analysis and converting that data into actionable information. This information must
be used to calculate and evaluate options, to enable decision making for
increase the performance and reach of a company. Furthermore, DT involves companies,
business models, processes, relationships, products, etc.” (Schallmo et al., 2017).20 Digital Transformation and Organizational Performance in Companies in the Healthcare Sector
Electric power
On the other hand, the definition of Digital Transformation can be classified into aspects
technological as DT is based on the use of new digital technologies such as social networks,
mobile devices, analytics or embedded devices; Organizational aspect as DT
requires a change in organizational processes or the creation of new business models.
business; and Social aspect such as TD is a phenomenon that influences all aspects of
human life, its values ​​and especially ethical considerations (Reis et al., 2018).
The most complete conceptual definition of DT is "a process that aims
enhance an entity by triggering significant changes to its properties
through combinations of information, computing, communication and
connectivity" (Vial, 2019). Based on DT, organizations respond to changes in
its environment, globalized market and sustainability requirements through the use of
digital technologies for value creation in your organization. (Vial, 2019).
In general, DT is based on four technological pillars such as cloud computing,
mobile and cellular systems, social networks, and BDA. Furthermore, these are driven by
innovation accelerators, including IoT solutions, robotics, 3D printing,
artificial intelligence, augmented and virtual reality, cognitive systems and security of
next generation (NextGen). Although, beyond automation and optimization,
Technology helps organizations achieve differentiation by creating value or
maintaining its competitive advantage based on the organization's capabilities (Pereira
et al., 2020; Reis et al., 2018). This new reality not only offers enormous potential for
innovation and a potential improvement in the performance of organizations, but
Furthermore, it has an impact on people, organizations and society in general (Pereira
et al., 2020; Schallmo et al., 2017).
Digital transformation includes the process that includes the data cycle, technologies
of information and communication, the personnel associated with production and decision making,
that allows the development of change in operations, business models and the way
to work in order to add more value to the organization (B. Chen et al., 2017; Emily
Coyne, Joshua Coyne, Kenton Walker, 2018; SCE-Cisco-IBM Sgra Team_2011, 2011).
One of the paradigms of digital transformation corresponds to the use of data
generated by various sources, in industrial fields, for example, to obtain
information that allows generating knowledge for subsequent decision making. So,
The data considered as assets, digital replicas and systems, must have Chapter 1 - Theoretical Framework 21
characteristics such as its definition, function, format, time period and relevance
to make reports that become valuable information for companies. This
allows analysis that generates knowledge, through analytics functionalities
present in the new management systems, in order to make decisions that promote
innovation in production processes.
The life cycle of data associated with digital transformation (see Figure 1-1) is
considers an important aspect in the process of converting Big Data into information.
This data life cycle can be classified into three phases (Emily Coyne, Joshua
Coyne, Kenton Walker, 2018):
● Creation: The activities of this phase are the first to emerge in the life cycle
of the data and prescribe the appropriate way to ensure that the data
enter the system are clean and usable:
○ Needs assessment: Systematic analysis of the needs of
information, reports and data of an organization. This analysis describes not
not only the required information, but also the data used to create
that information.
○ Acquisition: acquisition of data from internal departments or counterparties
external.
○ Classification: involves applying appropriate metadata to each element
of data to give clear meaning and context to the data.
○ Conversion: modifying the format of a data element so that it is
consistent with the current or expected needs of the
information and adapts to existing storage infrastructure.
○ Ingestion: manual or automatic data entry.
● Maintenance: essential activities to ensure long-term access
and to discard information that no longer has value. These activities are:
○ Storage: selection of appropriate formats, media and locations
for the data. The choice must take into account the type of data being
stored and their useful life.
○ Indexing: Maps data objects to their location in a set of
data to speed up the search.
○ Update: Update data stores to ensure the
circulation of data and metadata, avoiding degradation.22 Digital Transformation and Organizational Performance in Companies in the Sector of
Electric power
○ Interpretation: selection and conservation of the necessary hardware and software
to convert data sets into machine-readable formats
and humans.
○ Disposition: Final disposition of the information. Return of data or
intellectual property to a party to which it is licensed. Activities such as
archive the data in a long-term storage facility or
Destroying them is part of this phase.
● Use: Highlights the objectives of the creation and maintenance phases and the purpose
fundamental of an information system: access and analyze information to
help decision makers.
○ Search: the objective of this phase is to find information easily,
relying on the classification and storage stages.
○ Analysis: involves activities aimed at obtaining useful information from
the databases.
○ Report Generation: communication of information to policyholders
of internal and external decisions.
The combination of these three phases allows data to be converted into useful information.Chapter 1 - Theoretical Framework 23

Coyne, Joshua Coyne, Kenton Walker, 2018)
In the data cycle presented, data is an asset only if it meets objectives
specific goals drawn up by the organization, allowing them to be converted into information
useful for decision making (Emily Coyne, Joshua Coyne, Kenton Walker, 2018).
The flow of information concerning digital transformation occurs in environments
industrial and so-called Smart Factories, which use technology from
information (e.g. cloud platforms and Internet of things (IoT)) to improve
management of manufacturing resources and service quality. This allows through
analysis of manufacturing data, realize flexible manufacturing, reconfigure the
dynamics and optimization of production, in order to adapt the system to changes
of the business model and consumer purchasing (B. Chen et al., 2017).
Digital transformation as a process of change at a productive, business and social level
It is facilitated by the development of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT). Of

collaboration on the network, robots, artificial intelligence, among others, that facilitate
implementation of technological changes in the production processes of companies.
These information management technologies include systems to store, retrieve
and process information, perform calculations and prepare reports. This requires ensuring the
implementation of distributed services, analysis of data management, development of
custom applications and the implementation of cybersecure systems.
Additionally, one of the objectives of digital transformation is to take
decisions based on online and real-time information, with the challenge of
transform the data associated with business production into valuable information and
knowledge. To develop this, digital transformation can be supported and
build on technologies such as IoT, Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), blockchain, Big
Data, algorithms and expert systems, among others; in addition to technological tools
that ICTs offer (SCE-Cisco-IBM Sgra Team_2011, 2011).
Big Data can be formed from a large collection of sensors, databases,
emails, websites, images and social networks. The challenges of Big Data are
visualization, extraction, analysis, capture, storage, search and sharing
of data (Mohanty, Choppali, & Kougianos, 2016).
The implementation of digital technology and especially Big Data systems requires a
extremely large network hardware architecture, cloud data management, a
High, extremely fast Internet connectivity and system interoperability.
In addition, it is necessary to build complex infrastructures and architectures along with methods
computer analytics extremely difficult for managers and
employees who may reject its implementation and oppose the use of analyzed data
for decision making (Rialti et al., 2019). Therefore, it is necessary to promote the
development of technical, managerial and personnel capabilities related to BDA where
possible to understand the complexity of the infrastructure, the analysis methodologies
of data, the contributions and potential effects of data use in processes (Rialti et al.,
2019).
Big Data is characterized by volume, velocity, variety, veracity, value, variability and
visualization of the large amount of data known as "Seven V of Big Data" (Alsaig,

Digital transformation corresponds to the use of data as assets generated by
diverse sources and processes in applications such as Big Data, augmented reality,
machine learning, business analytics and prediction, blockchain, applications of
IoT, where data becomes valuable information for companies (Fernández-
Caramés & Fraga-Lamas, 2018; Lom, Pribyl, & Svitek, 2016; Mohanty et al., 2016; SCE-
Cisco-IBM Sgra Team_2011, 2011).
Organizations that embrace digital transformation can leverage data
when they have the capacity to adapt, adopt technology and new methods to
operate their businesses together with the interrelation that they can couple with Culture, Leadership,
Processes, Structure and Communications of the organization. This requires a continuous
evolution and innovation in digital technologies, collective learning and updating of
The abilities; besides , to reinvent the organization in the management processes of the
change (Cianni, Mary, and Steven Steckler, 2017).
Big Data Analysis (BDA), as part of the digital transformation, offers companies
business-focused practices and methodologies, providing a competitive advantage
in data-based decision making that allows improving the efficiency and effectiveness of the
business due to its high operational and strategic potential (Côrte-Real et al., 2017; Ji-fan
Ren et al., 2017). This requires generating Big Data capabilities with innovative ways of
organization, learning and innovation (Ji-fan Ren et al., 2017). This would allow improving the
customer relationship, operations risk management, operational efficiency and
company performance (Ji-fan Ren et al., 2017).
Big Data capability is the ability of an organization to take advantage of large
volumes of data to improve their processes and performance indicators (Correa
Ospina, Martha Liliana; Díaz Pinzón, 2018; Gunasekaran et al., 2017). Besides, the
Innovation capacity is related to the use of internal or external resources in the
development of new technologies, processes, products, services, strategies or structure
organizational to provide a novel and applicable solution to the organization (Correa Ospina,
Martha Liliana; Díaz Pinzón, 2018). Therefore, a company must combine its resources
financial, physical, human and organizational to create BDA capabilities as an advantage
competitive (Gupta & George, 2016). Chapter 1 - Theoretical Framework 27
In this way, the close relationship between Big Data Analysis (BDA) and
Digital Transformation where it is important to evaluate the relationship of BDA technologies with
the performance of organizations.
1.2 Organizational Transformation
The concept of Organizational Transformation (OT) has changed even since 1980, in
where it was associated with “second order changes” by Levy and Mery, radical changes,
deep and revolutionary. Subsequent to this, the vision of OT has been considered in a
more holistic way, by authors such as King, Guta et al, to significantly improve the
general performance of the organization, in topics such as quality, responsiveness,
cost, flexibility, among others; through planned change.
Later, researchers defined Organizational Transformation as changes
fundamental characteristics such as structure, process, culture and capacity. (Cha &
Cha, 2014). From there, and seeing OT as rapid, mini-revolutionary and
incremental state transitions, the term “morphing” is introduced to
describe Organizational Transformation as changes in a comprehensive, continuous and
dynamic.
The continuous transformation attributed to OT includes aspects such as change
in the range of products and services offered by the organization, as well as the reconfiguration
of resources, capabilities and structures of o offer, changes in control approaches
planned by timely experimentation (Cha & Cha, 2014).
In (Cha & Cha, 2014) a compilation of some definitions associated with
Organizational Transformation. Within these, the central idea of ​​time and the
differences in the conditions of states before and after the change. Likewise, in
The definitions presented in Table 1-2 represent thoughts of some
people from their particular perspective and context, based on specific research,
although, there is no generalized definition of the concept.28 Digital Transformation and Organizational Performance in Companies in the Healthcare Sector

1.3 Organizational Performance
performance)
Organizational performance is related to the actual results of a company or
organization measured against planned goals or objectives.(“businessdictionary,”
n.d.). According to (Richard, Devinney, Yip, & Johnson, 2009) the performance
organizational comprises three specific result areas:
1. Financial performance: profits, return on assets, return on investment, etc.
2. Product market performance: sales, market share, etc.
3. Shareholder Return: Total Shareholder Return, Value
added economic, etc.
Financial performance refers to measurements of operations and policies
of an organization in monetary terms, for example: return on assets, return on
investment, added value, among others.
Market performance measures the performance of a company or product in the market,
that is, if market share has increased or if updates to a
product allow increased sales.
Shareholder profitability establishes how much an organization enriches its
shareholders. Also, it can refer to the market capitalization of an organization.
In this way, organizational performance involves its development
strategic planners, operations managers, financial directors, advisors
legal, businessmen (owners of the organization), among others.
In turn, (Whitten, Kenneth, & Zelbst, 2012) take as a definition of performance
organizational the average market share or share, the average volume of
sales and average sales growth, indicators that reflect the degree to which30 Digital Transformation and Organizational Performance in Companies in the Healthcare Sector
Electric power
the organization performs better than its competitors (Ashrafi, Kelleher, & Kuilboer,
2014; Whitten et al., 2012).
In (Cha & Cha, 2014) to evaluate the organizational performance of a company,
consider the following indicators that determine organizational performance: value
for money, customer retention rate, sales growth rate, profitability of the
company and general competitive position.
For its part, in (Sklyar, Kowalkowski, Tronvoll, & Sörhammar, 2019) the
following criteria to measure organizational performance: Average return on
investment, Average profit, Average return on sales, Average growth of
market share, average sales volume growth and growth
average sales (in dollars).
Furthermore, (Richard et al., 2009), highlights organizational performance as one of the
most important constructs in research management and management research,
related to stakeholders, the heterogeneous circumstances of the
products and time. However, this review shows that
subjective perceptions related to the definition and various ways are used to
its measurement. These measures include various financial operation indices, such as
net earnings after taxes and capital returns, and also, measures of
results in successful experiences. It is concluded that there is a lack of clarity of the
theoretical definition of organizational performance and a lack of consistency
methodological in the formulation of constructs, making a scientific comparison difficult
effective.
However, organizational performance is not a unidimensional theoretical construct.
nor is it likely that it can be characterized by a single operational measure. Therefore, the
Measures of organizational performance can vary according to the domain of
research and thus adopt its specific measures by discipline.
Furthermore, (Jenatabadi, 2015) classify organizational performance into six categories. HE
initially mentions Etzioni's concept (Penley & Gould, 1988), which is based on
the evaluation of compliance or not with the established objectives. Other researchers,
as (Chandler, 1962) maintain that the final criterion of organizational performance is its
long-term growth and survival. The improvement is established as a primary objective
continuum of organizational performance, and it is highlighted that the common definitions are Chapter 1 - Theoretical Framework 31
the "effectiveness" or achievement of the objective. In contrast, it is suggested to measure performance
organizational based on two factors that are: Adequately adjust the organization and
their environments; and a good fit between the organization and its individual contributors. By
Therefore, the dimension of relevance or customer satisfaction is included in the definition
(Jenatabadi, 2015).
Additionally, in (Jenatabadi, 2015) the definition focused on means and ends is presented.
of the organization as a social system with resources that can meet the objectives

collaborators, maintaining low turnover rates, costs and labor disturbances.
Finally, the dimensions of "effectiveness in
the objectives of the organization", "efficiency in organizational resources" and "relevance
in stakeholder satisfaction" in the definition of Organizational Performance.
In addition, some activities for performance measurement (PM) are mentioned, which
They allow business management to excel through improving motivation,
monitoring performance, improving communication and diagnosing problems.
Furthermore, it allows you to identify and formulate improvements in management strategy. Next,
Some proposed measurements are listed (Jenatabadi, 2015):
● Monitoring business progress: Observe the progress of a company with
regarding the achievement of its established objectives through the supervision of the
results.
● Monitoring the effect of the strategies and the plan: through the results,
tests the impact and possibility of strategies and plans.
● Diagnosis: based on the analysis of the results, where these can show the
failure symptoms and encourage the identification of its probable causes.
● Support decision making: PM allows an organization to search and identify
the causes that have led to its success and the potential possibilities that the company
can use for further development. PM ensures that decisions are made
on facts rather than assumptions.
● Facilitation of motivation and communication: PM indicates the rate of progress
of a company and highlights its current and future state of performance. The motivation
and PM clarity provide the company with an increase in the overall rate of
operation, including communication between its staff and managers.32 Digital Transformation and Organizational Performance in Companies in the Healthcare Sector

1.4 Structural Equation Model (structural
equation modeling)
In (Byrne, 2012), the structural equation model is defined as a methodology
statistics that adopts the evaluation of a hypothesis for the analysis of a theory
structural related to some phenomenon. Typically, this theory represents processes
"causals" that generate observations in multiple variables. In (Anderson & Gerbing,
1988) highlights the potential of structural equation models for development
of theories and the validation of constructs in areas such as psychology and social sciences.
For its part, (Fornell & Larcker, 2012) mentions that researchers have begun to
demonstrate the advantages of these models with unobserved constructs for estimation
of parameters and hypothesis testing in causal models.
(Bagozzi & Yi, 2012) defines structural equation models as procedures
statistics for the measurement of functional, predictive and causal tests and hypotheses.
(Gunasekaran et al., 2017) focuses their research on the RBV, management commitment and the
diffusion of innovation following the adoption of BDA initiatives to develop and
test a model that explains the impact of BDPA (Big data and predictive analytics) on the
supply chain performance and organizational performance.
They consider the BDPA process structured in three stages: acceptance, routinization and
assimilation. Acceptance refers to the perception of BDPA, by the
stakeholders of the organization; routinization about how well systems fit
of governance of an organization to accommodate BDPA; and assimilation to how well
has spread o BDPA through the organizational process
According to the proposed model, they consider that connectivity resources and
information exchange mediated by the effect of top management commitment
(TMC, top management commitment) help the assimilation of BDPA, which impacts
on supply chain performance and organizational performance for the
achievement of competitive advantage (see Figure 1-2). Chapter 1 - Theoretical Framework 33
Figure 1-2. Model proposed in (Gunasekaran et al., 2017)
On the other hand, (Merendino et al., 2018) develop a conceptual model using the theory
based on knowledge to evaluate the value of BDA. This research model proves
empirically 12 propositions. The study evaluates the value chain and begins to see

in Figure 1-3.34 Digital Transformation and Organizational Performance in Companies in the Healthcare Sector
Electric power
Figure 1-3. Model proposed by (Côrte-Real et al., 2017).
In (Adrian, Abdullah, Atan, & Jusoh, 2018) a model of the evaluation of
implementation of Big Data Analytics and the effect on decision making. The model was
developed based on three dimensions, the organization focused on carrying out a
data strategy; people through collaborative knowledge workers
which refers to the skills of the analytical staff, the organizational relationship and the culture
analytics; and the technological dimension for the execution of data analysis, which includes the
IT infrastructures, information processing, data governance and
data quality management. The effect of BDAIA (big data analytics implementation
assessment) influences the effectiveness of decision making, as well as the indirect effect
of realizing the BDA strategy, the collaborative knowledge worker and the execution of
data analysis factors as shown in Figure 1-4.
Another study of interest is the one presented by (Mishra, Luo, Hazen, Hassini, & Foropon,
2018), which proposes a model to examine how IT implementation (i.e.
the strategic flexibility of IT, the partnership between companies and Big data and predictive
analytics (BDPA) and alignment between companies and BDPA and resource capabilities

In the literature, BDPA is proposed as a dynamic capability and is put into
consideration that the diffusion of BDPA has implications for value creation
organizational (Mishra et al., 2018). The proposed model takes advantage of the capabilities of
Information technologies (IT) and human resources to develop the capacity of
BDPA, which directly affects organizational performance (Organization
performance, OP) as shown in Figure 1-5.

latent). Through a measurement model that defines constructs and establishes
relationships between them. It is frequently used in the social sciences due to its
ability to impute relationships between unobservable constructs.36 Digital Transformation and Organizational Performance in Companies in the Healthcare Sector
Electric power
These models develop a hypothesis and implement measurement instruments with
questions designed to measure the relationships between constructs according to the
initial hypothesis raised.
1.5 Resource-Based Theory
View RBV)
The RBV maintains that organizations gain a competitive advantage by creating
sets of resources or strategic capabilities. RBV focuses on internal resources
of the company to identify assets, capabilities and competencies with the potential to
offer competitive advantages (Jay B. Barney, Ketchen, & Wright, 2011).
RBV is considered a compelling theory in IT, to theoretically and empirically evaluate the
strategic value of organizational resources and establish relationships with
business variables. This allows you to identify and categorize IT resources, establish
suitable ways to unite and combine various resources and measure the effect of these resources
(Gupta & George, 2016; Wade & Hulland, 2004).
In organizations it is important to ensure that resources are tangible within RBV.
In general, resources can be classified as tangible, human abilities, and types
intangibles. Tangible resources are financial and physical resources, in skills
Humans bring together knowledge and skills, and intangibles are culture.
organizational and organizational learning (Gunasekaran et al., 2017; Gupta & George,
2016; Merendino et al., 2018).
Financial resources include debt, equity, retained earnings, etc. The resources
Physical include machines, manufacturing facilities, buildings. human resources
include the experience, knowledge, judgment, risk management and expertise of the
professionals. l Organizational resources include history, politics, structure,
values, relationships, control and management system, compensation policies and culture
organizational (Gunasekaran et al., 2017; Gupta & George, 2016; Merendino et al., 2018).
For its part, according to (Größler & Grübner, 2006), resources can be discriminated
in:
● Physical capital
● Human capitalChapter 1 - Theoretical Framework 37
● Technological capital
● Reputation capital
Furthermore, it is considered that these can be tangible (such as infrastructure) or
intangibles (such as the action of sharing information or knowledge). Likewise, it
associates better performance of an organization with the possession of valuable, rare,
imperfectly imitable and resources with adequate organization (Amit & Schoemaker,
1993; Jay B. Barney et al., 2011; Merendino et al., 2018). Thus, the tangible resources and
intangibles must be valuable, rare, inimitable and non-substitutable so that it can generate
a competitive advantage (Erevelles, Fukawa, & Swayne, 2016; Gunasekaran et al., 2017;
Gupta & George, 2016; Wade & Hulland, 2004). Studies seek to identify resources that
will enable organizations to build BDA capabilities and improve business performance.
organization (Gunasekaran et al., 2017; Gupta & George, 2016).
1.6 Knowledge-Based Theory (Knowledge
Based View Theory - KBV)
KBV theory states that an organization's knowledge resources are unique and
inimitable and that the main function of the organization is to take advantage of them to obtain
productive results (Côrte-Real et al., 2017). This knowledge is integrated and adopted
based on organizational culture, organizational policy and strategy, improvement processes
continuous and traceability of procedures, ICT systems and employee roles
(Kodama, 2006). The KBV theory considers that the types of capabilities must be differentiated
based on knowledge, especially for the use of ICT or Big Data (Kodama, 2006). The
Companies that have high levels of staff knowledge and participation can
more skillfully identify the need for resource change management
existing and decide on the actions necessary to implement these changes (Côrte-
Real et al., 2017).
The two main types of knowledge in the organization are explicit knowledge and
the unspoken Explicit knowledge can be expressed and identified within routines,
traceability processes and organizational technologies (Côrte-Real et al., 2017). This
specific knowledge of trends in the industry sector to which the company belongs
organization.38 Digital Transformation and Organizational Performance in Companies in the Healthcare Sector
Electric power
With tacit knowledge, a competitive advantage can be obtained from the capabilities
of professionals or specific to the organization to respond to changes in the
market structure or changes in regulations. Professionals develop
knowledge I quote by action and experience, this operates on a subconscious level and is
difficult to articulate and disseminate in the organization (Kodama, 2006).
The implementation of digital transformation technologies requires a management system
of knowledge with an open approach to foster knowledge flows. This
improves the development of internal knowledge management capacity and increases the
innovation capacity of the company (Santoro, Vrontis, Thrassou, & Dezi, 2018). This
Capacity refers to the ability of an organization to explore and retain the
internal and external knowledge within its own ecosystem, with a focus on
open innovation that allows the creation of new products and processes. The management of
Knowledge identifies and leverages knowledge to foster processes of
innovation where functional and motivational factors are relevant to its success
(Santoro, Fiano, Bertoldi, & Ciampi, 2018).
1.7 Theory of Dynamic Capabilities (Dynamic
capability theory - DC)
The concept of dynamic capabilities was originally used by Teece, Pisano and
Shuen in 1997, which they defined as:
"organization's ability to integrate, build and reconfigure
internal and external competencies to quickly address environments
changing” (Pisano, Teece, Shuen, & Teece Gary Shuen, Amy, 1997).
For their part (Eisenhardt & Martin, 2000), they relate the importance of "capabilities
"dynamics" in the adequate and timely adaptation to the changing environment through
reconfiguration of processes and resources, both internal and external. Reconfiguration
given from existing competencies, considering data as an asset, the
capabilities in Big Data routines, processes and analysis and knowledge management
from these data (Rialti et al., 2019). This reconfiguration of processes and resources is
can occur in a planned way, through change management processes based on the
existing knowledge to generate a competitive advantage (Rialti et al., 2019).Chapter 1 - Theoretical Framework 39
Makadok defines capabilities as subsets of a company's resources that
are not transferred, the objective of which is to improve the productivity of other resources. Are
Capacities depend on the operating conditions of each organization.
The theory of Dynamic Capabilities arises from the perspective based on RBV and KBV, as
an effective theory for the field of strategic management for business and management
of ICT. This theory maintains that dynamic capabilities allow companies
modify your resources to adapt quickly to changing conditions and
maintain its competitive advantage (Rialti et al., 2019).
DC is made up of the ability to detect and configure opportunities and threats,
and maintain competitiveness through improvement, combination, protection and reconfiguration
of tangible and intangible assets. (Teece, 2007) proposes DC to face new
challenges such as the ability ity of employees to learn and build new assets,
integrate strategic assets, including capacity, technology and customer requirements,
in processes and the transformation or reuse of existing assets. Furthermore, it is defined
agility as a dynamic capability where companies can identify and
respond to threats and opportunities, and quickly adjust their behaviors
(Côrte-Real et al., 2017). In (Mihardjo, Sasmoko, Alamsyah, & Elidjen, 2019) the
dynamic ability seen by Helfat, Peteraf and Schoemaker as an improvement in vision
resource-based, addressing problems with the routine process, in terms of
resources, processes, products and services, that the organization needs to adapt.
In conclusion, in this chapter the conceptual framework of the themes was developed
related to Digital Transformation and Organizational Performance, in order to have
a starting point for building the model. In this review of concepts
evidences a close relationship between data, the life cycle associated with transformation
digital and the process of converting Big Data into information. Therefore, it is considered the
Big Data theory as one of the fundamental elements of Digital transformation.
Organizational Transformation is presented under the ideas of fundamental change,
productivity, discontinuous changes, broad changes in the organizational entity and
unexpected transitions. Proposals related to performance are presented
organizational structure of companies through real and measured results regarding
planned goals and objectives.40 Digital Transformation and Organizational Performance in Companies in the Healthcare Sector
Electric power
In MES, cases from the literature are presented that serve as input for the construction of the
proposed model. It is evident that the models found analyze simple relationships
between a few variables and the need to formulate a model that includes
more variables, which in turn integrate more elements inside in order to generate a
more complex model than those studied in the literature review.
The most recurrent definitions of resource-based theories are presented,
knowledge and dynamic capabilities, allowing us to highlight that the models
considered integrate these theories into their conceptual proposals. Furthermore, you can
conclude that the proposed model must be heterogeneous and include elements that associate the
three theories and methodologies.2. Chapter 2 - Systematic Review

along with the links between these. The strength of the links can indicate the number of
cited references that two publications have in common (in the case of links from
bibliographic coupling), the number of publications that two researchers have been
co-authors (in the case of co-authorship links), or the number of publications in which
two terms appear together (in the case of match links). The items are grouped
in clusters, by attributes such as the weight of each element, which are displayed in the
map. In the visualization, items with a higher weight are displayed more
prominently than elements with a lower weight, indicating the importance of the

2.3 Theories
The systematic review of the literature includes the description and advances in three theories
different related to organizational performance and its relationship with transformation
digital. These include:
Dynamic Capabilities (DC)
In order to find competitive advantages, DC such as organizational agility is
considered essential. In (Gunasekaran et al., 2017) a conceptual model is proposed
based on a perspective based on knowledge and capability theories
dynamics. The model evaluates the value chain through 12 prepositions:
● BDA used to leverage different forms of knowledge in order to create
organizational agility (H1, H2, H3)
● BDA to provide organizational agility to the company through the use of a
effective knowledge management. Companies that have this type of capacity
dynamics can achieve competitive advantage directly (H4a) or
indirectly through business processes (H4b).
● The results obtained through the use of business processes will affect the
general organization (H5).
● Agility can mediate the relationship between knowledge assets and
performance (H6a, b, c - H7a, b, c).
Contributions to the improvement are presented in (Braganza, Brooks, Nepelski, Ali, & Moro, 2017).

comparative.
The more frequently an organization reconfigures and transforms its capabilities, the
the greater the probability of achieving competitive advantages (Braganza et al., 2017).
For their part, Eisenhardt and Martin (2000) suggest that in organizations
dynamic capabilities are simple, experimental and iterative, in contrast to
more stable markets, where they are complex, analytical and linear, (Eisenhardt & Martin,
2000). (Argote, 2012) concludes that organizations face difficulties when
Leaders use existing knowledge to generalize from past experiences
In this sense, (Zollo & Winter, 2002) on page 344 propose "the capabilities

explicit activities of articulation and codification of knowledge." The development of
dynamic capabilities invoke mechanisms that go beyond the tacit accumulation of

stakeholders (Hill & Jones, 1995).
Organizations combine skills, data, technologies and experience to create
products and services that generate income, greater efficiency and generally greater
competitive advantages, (Braganza et al., 2017).
In (Braganza et al., 2017) it is shown that Big Data processes must change
dynamically in response to external and internal influences of organizations,
presenting in their study bases to map the ways in which organizations56 Digital Transformation and Organizational Performance in Companies in the Information Sector

adapt and transform their capabilities based on the strategic knowledge they
obtained from Big Data initiatives.
Additionally, (Braganza et al., 2017) concludes that the relationship between Big data and
Dynamic capabilities are important because Big data processes must transform
over time as organizations reconfigure or develop new
capabilities to achieve results from the knowledge acquired in Big Data.
Dynamic capabilities can be considered to represent an appropriate approach
to study the effect of information systems and Big Data. The BDA can be used
in different places uations and can provide a competitive advantage over the market

capabilities that can help an organization adapt a resource base

BDA progressively influences the competitiveness of organizations, their performance

take advantage of new opportunities, seek collaborations and strategic partners, improve the
knowledge flow and facilitate knowledge sharing (McAfee & Brynjolfsson,

Resource Based View (RBV)
In (Gunasekaran et al., 2017) the assimilation of Big Data and analysis is conceptualized
predictive BDPA (Big Data and Predictive Analytics), in the chain
supply and organizational performance as a three-stage process: acceptance,
routinization and assimilation.
From the resource-based perspective, the influence of resources is identified:
connectivity and information exchange in organizational performance, concludes ing
that resources under the mediation effect of top management commitment, in the
assimilation of big data, supply chain and organizational performance,
positively relate to the acceptance of BDPA.
On the other hand, connectivity and information exchange, under the mediation effect of
commitment of senior management, improves acceptance of the use of Big Data analytics and
prediction, improves performance and business processes measured through the theoretical RBV
and through online surveys of company managers (Gunasekaran et al., 2017).
Senior management must be able to acquire IT resources, invest in them to generate
BDA capabilities and commit to the process to achieve improved performance
of the organization (Gunasekaran et al., 2017). Also, the importance of
evaluate, through RBV, the impact of Big Data on marketing activities from the
process of collecting consumer activities, the process of extracting
information and the use of consumer knowledge to improve
dynamic and adaptive capabilities of the organization (Erevelles et al., 2016).
In (Braganza et al., 2017) some limitations are identified in the theory based on
resources in the context of Big Data initiatives, given that the implementation was carried out
thinking about the management of organizational resources and it is argued that Big Data nullifies58 Digital Transformation and Organizational Performance in Companies in the Information Sector
Electric power
many of the assumptions of resource-based theory to achieve an advantage
competitive. Such as, for example, open access to data so that consent
can be proven or questioned (Popper, 1963), data that is often not
possible to access due to confidentiality issues.
Data is considered one of the critical resources in Big Data and theory
based on resources introduced in 09_WoS provides a framework called VRIN
(Value, Rarity, Imperfect Imitability and Non-substitutability), including property of the
resources and their attributes to consider strategic resources, in order to provide a
deeper understanding of the strategic actions of organizations.
(J. B. Barney, 1986) suggests that strategic resources have four attributes: value,
rarity, imperfect imitability and non-substitutability and identifies that they generate sources of
competitive advantage. Thus, Conner suggests that the degree of heterogeneity of resources
influences the potential for competitive advantage, proposing that the attributes of Value and
Rarity confers a competitive advantage, while Inimitability and Non-
Substitutability, along with the other two, confer sustainability. (Conner, 1991). For other
part, Citing Hofer and Schendel, 1980 and Grant (1991), the following classification is suggested
of types of resources (Grant, 1991; Hofer & Schendel, 1980):
 Financial resources,
 Physical resources,
 Human resources,
 Re organizational courses (quality control systems, corporate culture,
relations)
 Technological capabilities
 Intangible resources (e.g. reputation, brand recognition, goodwill
willpower)
In the realm of Big Data, physical capital resources include platforms for collecting
and store large amounts (volume) of truthful data that continuously flows into
real time (velocity) from many different sources (variety) and Big Data analytics.
Human capital resources include information from data scientists and strategies
to capture valid data, manage and extract information. Capital resources
include an organizational structure that allows the company to transform data into
knowledge and being able to use it in decision-making and concrete actions (Erevelles etChapter 2 - Systematic Review of the Literature 59
al., 2016). The structure of the organization is what is responsible for defining the allocation of
tasks, processes and procedures, levels of hierarchy, formal mechanisms of
coordination and interaction patterns (Valentin, 2017).
Therefore, to generate a competitive advantage with resources, it is required that
leaders develop capabilities, structure resources to use in processes, methodologies
of acquiring and implementing Big Data analytics in the business (Gunasekaran et al.,
2017). Capabilities are a necessity for the organization and depend on its context
because these are a subset of the resources that are not transferable and have as
objective to improve the productivity of other resources (Erevelles et al., 2016; Gunasekaran et
al., 2017).
According to the above, in a digital organization, leaders must ensure their
strategic priorities, cultural values, organizational norms and ensure
transmit them to your collaborators. Thus, human aspects, such as charisma,
motivation, adaptation and the ability to be facilitators become the
most important characteristics in leaders of digital organizations (Cianni, Mary,
and Steven Steckler, 2017). These responsive leaders must facilitate the design, execution
of actions and be open to employee initiatives, allowing criticism
and feedback are tools that strengthen them (Dery, Sebastian, & van der
Meulen, 2017).
In conclusion, sustainable leadership focused on the employee experience, with
systemic learning mechanisms and strategies linked to the vision of the organization,
simplify work life and instill innovative leadership-based behaviors
shared (Dery et al., 2017). On the other hand, the organizational culture is based on the
values, behavior, member relationships, power relations and
existing competencies that can trigger a culture of achievement based on
the expected results or culture of support for personal motivation (Valentin, 2017).
b roasted in Knowledge (KBV, knowledge-based view)
The impact of BDA on the value chain is examined in (Côrte-Real et al., 2017).
entrepreneurship in a European context by empirically testing a new theoretical framework that
combines strategic management theories (KBV and DC theory). research is presented
that evaluate how BDA can add value to the organization's performance,60 Digital Transformation and Organizational Performance in Companies in the Healthcare Sector
Electric power
establishing links between knowledge assets, organizational agility and in
productivity.
The main result of the study is the understanding of the BDA value chain,
through a model based on the KBV and DC theories. It is possible to perceive the assets of
knowledge and the impacts on process performance and competitive advantage of
BDA initiatives in European companies, and presents the following conclusions of the study
(Côrte-Real et al., 2017):
● BDA can be a strategic investment for European companies to improve
organizational agility and surviving in competitive markets.
● To create agility, European companies tend to believe that knowledge
external derived from BDA applications may be more effective in creating
agility than internal knowledge.
● BDA initiatives can lead to improved operational efficiency. With that,
Several paths can lead to competitive advantage, mediating the effects of
knowledge assets about performance.
The knowledge management presented in (Braganza et al., 2017) suggests that large
Data can provide deeper understanding for strategic action
the organizations. Camison and Fores develop four dimensions of
knowledge: acquisition, assimilation, transformation and application (Camisón & Forés,
2010). According to Filippini, Güttel and Nosella (2012), knowledge management initiatives
They are characterized by (Filippini, Güttel, & Nosella, 2012):
 A set of methods (formal descriptions of objectives and tasks)
 Roles (social structures and policies)
 Resources (human resources, time and infrastructure)
 Organizational routines that allow exploratory or exploitative learning
For their part, Donate and de Pablo (2015) highlight the importance of leadership oriented to the
knowledge in the management initiatives of organizations (Donate & de Pablo, 2015),
studying the effects of leadership on the abilities of organizations
to explore and exploit knowledge. In other studies, such as that of Rollins, Bellenger and
Johnston (2012) concludes that organizations do not usually adopt approaches
long-term planning for decision making (Rollins, Bellenger, & Johnston, 2012). Chapter 2 - Systematic Literature Review 61
Knowledge management is required to strengthen the mechanisms that facilitate it,
such as coding, ent exchange re individuals and teams, the stimulation of
creation, exchange and protection of knowledge. Additionally, you must provide the
necessary infrastructure and strengthen the structured coordination processes of the
knowledge management effectively. In this way, knowledge management
facilitates the creation of open and collaborative ecosystems, the exploitation of flows
of knowledge and increases the capacity for innovation (Santoro, Vrontis, et al., 2018).
The integration between administrative management based on digital technology and management of the
Knowledge allows organizations to make decisions focused on their objectives
strategic and preserve knowledge as the most important asset of the company
(Galvez Martinez, Casteneda Cuellar, & Tarazona Bermudez, 2017). The management of
Knowledge must tend to present and use information in a timely manner,
guaranteeing the availability, consistency and quality of the data (Galvez Martinez et al.,
2017).
2.4 Organizational Change Management
Digital transformations of companies require changes in processes,
functions and way of doing things. Organizational changes are determined
by internal and external factors. The internal changes refer to a new strategy
organizational, changes in the composition of professionals, new teams or changes
in the attitude of employees. External changes are changes in needs and
consumer desires, new government laws, new technologies or
economic changes (Valentin, 2017).
Globalization, ICT and sustainability generate a more dynamic competitive environment
for organizations, which requires assuming the challenges of generating profits and
develop capacity in organizations to generate sustained differentiating value in
time. This requires harmonizing the vision, organizational structure and culture, the
processes and functions to allow management decisions to be made with differential value
(Sandoval Duque, 2014).
Organizations must understand the meaning of the concept of Change Management to
prepare and dynamically change the strategy, structure, culture and operation of the
process, from understanding the forces that drive or stop change, resistance62 Digital Transformation and Organizational Performance in Companies in the Healthcare Sector
Electric power
to change, the speed of change, the attitude of people towards changes
organizational and opportunity depending on the organization's environment (Buono & Kerber,
2010; Sandoval Duque, 2014).
Organizational change must assume the needs of competitive circumstances
of the environment through the capacity for adaptive transformation (Sandoval Duque,
2014). External causes of change can be found such as new trends in
markets, globalization, new consumers, technological innovations, new
competitors, new lifestyles, sustainability or organizational and environmental, use of ICT,
digital transformation with Big Data and industrial revolution (Sandoval Duque, 2014). Causes
internals motivate change such as management's new vision of the future, changes in
structure or processes, new competitive strategies, mergers or alliances (Sandoval
Duke, 2014).
Therefore, organizations must be clear about the reason for the desired change and the
factors that drive them, along with the expected results to be able to plan the
organizational transformation actions (Sandoval Duque, 2014). These changes can
be superficial as small and continuous changes in strategies, structures,
processes, physical transformations with the advantages of being easy to apply, fast and with
limited costs; or profound changes that generate a high impact on the organization on the
culture, practices, vision, strategies, structure and planning, involving areas and
associated risks (Sandoval Duque, 2014).
The perspective of change management and decision making in the organization to determine

of decisions to make adjustments after having a difficulty or problem and seek
correct it. Finally, change due to crisis occurs in survival situations
with high levels of tension and unwanted consequences (Sandoval Duque, 2014).
Successful organizational change processes can begin with the definition of
principles about change due to its heterogeneity and complexity, such as the principle
holistic that integrates actions on all components of the organization (strategies,
structure, teams, services, products and others), or its philosophy (values, cultureChapter 2 - Systematic Literature Review 63
organizational, motivation). The breaking principle is used when change requires

principle of non-preference as the universality of the change process and the linking of
the people who affect the process. The indeterminacy principle explains processes
dynamic and complex changes with unpredictable elements (Sandoval Duque, 2014).
Models for managing organizational changes provide elements to facilitate the
decision making, which manage to generate value in change processes such as the
three steps of unfreezing, changing and refreezing carried out by Kurt Lewin (Montúfar, 2013;
Sandoval Duque, 2014).
The change model e Kurt Lewin is based on the evaluation of the behavior of
driving forces of change and the restrictive forces that prevent it and preserve the status quo
quo (Montúfar, 2013). The steps of Kurt Lewin's model begin with defrosting
that seeks to reduce the forces that maintain the organization at its current level of
behavior, continues with the change or movement where one seeks to move towards
new behavioral patterns and habits of the organization with new values,
habits, behaviors and attitudes, and finally the refreezing where the
organization in a new state of balance based on culture, norms, policies and
organizational structure (Bustos Martínez, Carrasco Sagredo, & Bull, 2018; Montúfar,
2013).
Regardless of the change management model, organizational transformation
and action planning can be based on the organization's strategic plans
towards the three levels of organization. Likewise, transformations can occur
of groups and individuals where the planned procedures materialize
through adjustments to the culture and strategic orientations of organizations, the
leadership and inductive learning, managing to gradually permeate the changes (Romero,
Matamoros, & Campo, 2013; Sandoval Duque, 2014).
This transformation can begin with the evolution of competencies, skills,
attitudes and behaviors of people in the organization that strengthen changes in
the processes and the way of doing things effectively (Sandoval Duque, 2014).
On the other hand, the transformation can begin from the functions, responsibilities and
tasks assigned to people who execute them repeatedly, who will end up adopting64 Digital Transformation and Organizational Performance in Companies in the Healthcare Sector
Electric power
as part of their daily lives. Both forms of transformation require leadership and
supervision of the process to guarantee the expected results (Kafel & Casadesus,
2016; Price & Chahal, 2006; Sandoval Duque, 2014).
Implementation difficulties
Incorrect organizational transformations generate significant costs, from
maintain or worsen problems, undermine employee commitment, and generate
resistance to change for future processes (N. Anand & Barsoux, 2017; Montúfar, 2013;
Sandoval Duque, 2014).
Leaders must prioritize changes while being aware of the catalyst for change.
transformation, the search for the value of change in efficiency, reinvesting in growth
sustainable development of the organization and the leadership capabilities necessary to carry it out
through change agents. The organization must then identify the search
specific that will lead to greater generation of value and as an example of the case of
"digital transformation" the digital revolution must be understood as a means to an end and
the organization must define the objective and goals for this purpose (N. Anand & Barsoux, 2017).
Likewise, it is important to strategically focus the change and not wear down the
organization with multiple fronts. The efforts of
transformation derived for five prototype approaches (N. Anand & Barsoux, 2017):
● Global presence in order to expand the reach of the international market, its
leadership, innovation, talent flows, capabilities and best practices. This
requires reconfiguring systems and networks to take advantage of capabilities, knowledge
and ideas, use diversity as a source of competitive advantage.
● Customer focus requires understanding your customers' needs and
provide improved information, experiences or results. They must be provided
personalized solutions by reconfiguring the customer experience
from organizing, equipping, training and rewarding the workforce to
better understand and address customer needs, redefine relationships with
suppliers, intermediaries and suppliers.
● Organizational agility that accelerates processes or simplifies the way

cultural. It seeks to develop the ability to detect and respond to changesChapter 2 - Systematic Review of Literature 65
important aspects of the environment, taking advantage of diversity to exploit opportunities and
learn to build prototypes quickly and institutionalize success stories.
● Innovation: incorporating ideas and new sources that allow taking advantage of new
opportunities by reconfiguring research partners and
development, end users, financiers, etc.
● Sustainability to be more socially responsible with natural resources,
involve stakeholders, taking advantage of sustainability as an advantage
strategy and communicate commitment to the sustainability agenda while continuing to
side the balance between efficiency and sustainability objectives (N. Anand &
Barsoux, 2017).
Change management could be a competitive advantage to implement objectives
strategic such as sustainability (May & Stahl, 2017). The effectiveness of companies in
change management can be seen by considering the planning and leadership of the
implementation of the desired objectives. Companies could be classified as
sleepers (low planning and leadership), treadmills (high planning and low leadership),
dreamers (low planning and high leadership), executors (high planning and leadership)
(May & Stahl, 2017). Implementing companies are at the top of management practices
of changes and show an aggressive competitive effort. These have values
cultural, operational and strategic functional management system. Instead, the
dreaming companies have a well-developed strategic approach but planning
is done with informal communication and without cross functionality that guarantees the execution

McAfee study concludes some of the relevant changes in organizations
that are sought for Digital Transformation, among them are:
● Leadership. Set clear goals, vision and ask the right questions to

to detect a great opportunity, understand the market, the business, think
creatively and propose innovative solutions, persuade your collaborators
to adopt change and integrate the company's vision with the actions of
customers, employees, shareholders and other interested parties (McAfee &
Brynjolfsson, 2012) (Dery et al., 2017).
● Talent Management. Managing professionals such as data scientists and leaders

● Technology. A set of skills is required that guarantees quality,
availability and reliability of relevant internal and external data
They measure the process and are used for decision making (McAfee & Brynjolfsson, 2012).
● Decision making. An effective organization must bring together measured information and
making relevant decisions with professionals capable of exploiting
effective information with knowledge of the business and the market. This must be

intuition and instinct (McAfee & Brynjolfsson, 2012).
2.5 Relationship between Digital Transformation and
Organizational Performance
In the 1990s, the IT productivity paradox arose where
established a positive relationship between IT investments and company productivity.
This is resolved after more than two decades of research showing that
requires technical and management skills, IT infrastructure and the intellectual capital of
a company to obtain the value of the technology (Gupta & George, 2016; Sambamurthy
et al., 2003).
In (Sambamurthy et al., 2003) the strategic role of IT is analyzed by examining the
nomological network of influences where IT investments and capabilities affect the
company performance through dynamic capabilities and strategic processes
(capacity development, entrepreneurial action, and coevolutionary adaptation).
“Big data: The Management Revolution” by Andrew McAfee and Erik Brynjolfsson
(McAfee & Brynjolfsson, 2012) shows the potential changes in the organization that
must face to apply the BDA and improve the performance of organizations. The
Digital transformation offers the possibility of measuring any variable in real time toChapter 2 - Systematic Literature Review 67
better understand the process and your business for better decision making and performance
(McAfee & Brynjolfsson, 2012).
The increase in ICT, automation and interconnection are changing the way
manage current businesses (Valentin, 2017). The analysis of large amounts of data
business allows you to generate and translate this into a business advantage. This requires that the
business management is modified to move from decision making to intuition
to the rigor of the data and evidence (McAfee & Brynjolfsson, 2012). Data management can
start using it for customer management and thus better understand their interests, the use of
marketing tools to better understand the market and finally the management of the
business performance (H. Chen et al., 2012; Côrte-Real et al., 2017; Gupta & George,
2016; McAfee & Brynjolfsson, 2012).
The technical challenges of using Big Data are linked to managerial challenges from
the role of the executive team and other integrated areas of the organization, for the new
decision-making culture (McAfee & Brynjolfsson, 2012). Organizations can
obtain the benefits of using Big Data as long as they are able to manage the
change effectively with leadership, human talent management, technology, take
decision making and organizational culture. The leaders of the organization must go from being the
experts who always have the answer to be the ones who question and ask the question
appropriately, be facilitators of their collaborators and agents of change in the organization
(McAfee & Brynjolfsson, 2012).
Investments in BDA technologies alone do not create a competitive advantage. By
Therefore, organizations need to identify how to reorganize resources, processes,
structure, leadership, etc. in order to create BDA capabilities and have a way to
measure BDA capabilities and firm performance (Cianni, Mary, and Steven
Steckler, 2017; Côrte-Real et al., 2017; Fosso Wamba, Akter, & de Bourmont, 2019;
Gunasekaran et al., 2017; Gupta & George, 2016; Ji-fan Ren et al., 2017; McAfee &
Brynjolfsson, 2012). For this, resources are proposed that will allow companies to create
a BDA capability from tangible resources that include data, technology and
times and infrastructure, human resources with administrative and technical skills
of Big Data and intangible resources such as organizational culture, learning, structure,
vision and policy. Data-driven culture and organizational learning are considered
intangible resources critical to developing BDA capabilities (Gupta & George, 2016).68 Digital Transformation and Organizational Performance in Companies in the Business Sector
Electric power
Different publications emphasize the need to understand how to bda applications
can be a valuable resource where companies gain a competitive advantage and
increase your productivity. Measured data can offer invaluable information,
as long as technological resources, processes and structure are aligned
organizational with the culture of data-based decision making (Côrte-Real et al., 2017).
BDA can be a strategic investment for companies to improve agility

They contribute to improving the organization's performance through investments in BDA.
Studies show the effects of Big Data analysis capacity on the performance of
Firms and the Mediating Effects of Process-Oriented Dynamic Capabilities
(Merendino et al., 2018).
In the application of BDA, personnel administration, technological infrastructure,
Organizational culture and corporate decision making are critical capabilities in
organizations where organizational culture, platform and analytics skills
of professionals support the effectiveness of using BDA in business (Gunasekaran et
al., 2017; Ji-fan Ren et al., 2017). Also, instruments are proposed that determine the
balance of factors and their relationships to analyze an organization in industry 4.0
and identify the actions necessary to achieve high levels of performance in the long term.
This allows vulnerabilities and imbalances to be identified to help make decisions.
managerial decisions in critical area of ​​organizational performance (Valentin, 2017)
On the other hand, the comparison of the organizational transformation process is evident
to be digital with the process of change of a company to be global, where
presents the need for change management along with process considerations,
functions, capabilities of professionals, among others (Cianni, Mary, and Steven
Steckler, 2017). The connections between digital strategy and strategic objectives and
Operational processes can provide a competitive advantage, when a

of processes during the definition of system implementation information issues in the
business and the organization is required to make changes in the different functions of
its process (Correa Ospina, Martha Liliana; Díaz Pinzón, 2018; Sambamurthy et al., 2003).
Studies show that it is possible to obtain knowledge about the contribution of ICT to
performance of organizations and, in the particular case, the relationship between the capacity in
ICT, organizational capabilities and the performance of 102 MSMEs in Bogotá, from
multi-methodology proposed by Mingers with a phased process from appreciation,
analysis and evaluation to action (Correa Ospina, Martha Liliana; Díaz Pinzón, 2018).
This study concludes that the customer relationship is important in SMEs because of the
globalization of markets and that information systems favor the identification,
analysis and understanding of customer needs (Correa Ospina, Martha Liliana;
Díaz Pinzón, 2018).
In conclusion, the systematic review of the literature shows a research topic
incipient and require attention to the factors that promote or hinder the
digital transformation in organizations. It is identified that the greatest amount of
Documents about the study topics were made starting in 2017, thus
It is evident that the topic under study between digital transformation and performance
organizational is current. However, there are no authorships that remain with
time, which suggests varied productivity and is not too specific on the topic
under study.
The oldest publications, year 2015, are related to the impact on the
organizations associated with the use of information technologies and Big Data.
Regarding the relationship between the variables of the equation maps, a link is evident
direct between Big Data and organizational performance. Additionally, it presents
recurrently the formation of clusters around Big Data, changes
organizational and performance, strategy and business intelligence systems and
technology and information management.3. Chapter 3 - Methodology
The methodologies used to evaluate conceptual models are described below.
that relate the constructs and hypotheses proposed in the model to evaluate the effect on
organizational performance due to the implementation and use of digital technologies.
3.1 Methodologies
In (Gunasekaran et al., 2017) the resource-based vision theory is used to
conceptualize BDPA assimilation as a capacity that impacts the supply chain
supply and organizational performance, with the help of connectivity resources and
exchange of information, under the mediation of senior management commitment. The method
used is through a five-point Likert scale survey approach, from
“strongly disagree (1) to strongly agree (5)”, which were put
tested by a group of 6 experienced researchers. Later nte, taking into account
Taking into account the suggested adjustments, the questionnaire was sent via email to 45 consultants and
supply chain managers to review structure, readability, ambiguity
and integrity, to have a modified final instrument, based on comments.
As a result, the assimilation of BDPA is conceptualized as a process that involves
acceptance, routinization and assimilation, considering the impact of resources
(connectivity and exchange of information) and capabilities (ability to assimilate
Big Data) in SCP and OP. This supports the argument that if the resources are
mediated by the commitment of senior management it is possible to achieve acceptance of
BDPA, first step to achieve assimilation.
With this study, it is considered that the RBV theory is important to understand assimilation
of BDPA as a capability that depends on the pooling of resources (connectivity
and exchange of information) and with which positive impacts are obtained in the chain of
supply organizational performance and thereby achieve a competitive advantage
business.Chapter 2 - Systematic Literature Review 71
For its part, the model proposed in (Côrte-Real et al., 2017) and the validation of the 12
Hypotheses that evaluate the entire supply chain are tested through a survey
in several countries of European organizations. The study uses a survey instrument
based on a review of the literature and validation of the content, scope and purpose of the
made by academic researchers and 2 language experts. Subsequently, a
pilot study with 30 executives from different companies to the application group of the
main survey, in order to make modifications to the final instrument, eliminating
ambiguities and simplifying interpretation.
3.2 Experiments and Validation
Within the proposed models, validations are presented in (Côrte-Real et al., 2017).

For its part, in order to prove that data-driven companies would have better
results in terms of business performance, in (McAfee & Brynjolfsson, 2012)
mentions the application of structured interviews with executives from 330 companies
North American publics about their organizational and management practices.

independent. From the results obtained, it stands out that the companies that
characterized by their da cough, performed better on objective measures in terms
financial and operational. The study highlights the challenge of using Big Data in the field
management, which leads to a new decision-making culture, and new roles
(McAfee & Brynjolfsson, 2012). In turn, five management challenges are identified, within
of the change process to obtain the benefits of a transition to the use of big
data that are:
- Leadership: teams that establish clear objectives, define what success looks like and
ask the right questions72 Digital Transformation and Organizational Performance in Companies in the Healthcare Sector
Electric power
- Talent management: data scientists and other professionals who are experts in working
with large amounts of information
- Technology: tools to analyze data and integration of all sources
of relevant internal and external data
- Decision making: positioning of information and rights of
relevant decision in the same location
- Company culture: decisions based on data, which tend to be
better decisions, combining domain experience with data science.
On the other hand, the survey carried out to validate the model presented in (Côrte-Real et al.,
2017), an online tool was created in 2005. Respondent profiles were created
according to knowledge and expertise, as follows:
● Deep knowledge of the organization's strategy
● More than five years of experience in BDA initiatives
● Hold an IT/business executive/management position in the company.
An email is sent to apply the survey to 500 executives of
European companies, emails taken from the database of Dun & Bradstreet, one of the
world-leading firms in commercial information and business vision. The method is used
of partial least squares (PLS) to estimate the proposed conceptual model and
examine the validity of the constructs. The results support the claim that the
BDA applications can enable effective knowledge management so that
Companies create organizational agility (Côrte-Real et al., 2017).
The agility contemplated in the study is presented in the following ways (Côrte-Real
et al., 2017):
● Detecting opportunities and threats (for example, reacting to new products
or competitive services)
● Taking advantage of possible opportunities (for example, expanding into new
regional or international markets)
● Adjusting to the technological environment to achieve competitive advantage (e.g.
adopting new technologies to produce more products and services
efficiently)
In (Gunasekaran et al., 2017) the validation of the proposed model is done through a
three-stage improvement cycle to develop measures that satisfy all requirementsChapter 2 - Systematic Literature Review 73
of reliability, validity and unidimensionality (I. J. Chen & Paulraj, 2004). They used so much
alpha composite reliability (SCR) as the Cronbach scale (Fornell & Larcker, 2012;
Henseler, Ringle, & Sinkovics, 2009).
The commonly used method (Fornell & Larcker, 2012) was used to calculate the validity
convergent and discriminant, with criteria of shared average variance less than 0.50 and
values ​​of the square root of the average variance extracted (AVE), for each construct
realized, greater than any correlation estimate. Additionally, they were considered
several fit indices for each construct. From the analysis, unidimensionality was obtained
of the general fit of the model and discriminant validity.4. Chapter 4 - Design and

of decisions in the execution of energy projects. The experiment is carried out using
as a foundation the theory of Experimental Economics, which applies methods to study
the interaction of human beings in social contexts governed by rules
explicit or implicit (Fatás Juberías & Roig Cotanda, 2004).
4.1 Design and implementation
The design of the experiment is based on the following hypothesis, which we wish to validate:
Does having more information actually help us make better decisions? Wanted
provide a solution to the hypothesis raised through the fulfillment of the following objectives
when running the experiment.
● Establish the relationship between intuition versus evidence, obtained through
real data from organizational processes, in decision making. Chapter 3 - Design and Implementation of Experimental Practice 75
● Identify the importance of data around decision making, taking into account
realize that technology provides enormous amounts of data in information that
It may be a function of decision making.
The design was developed according to the flow diagram presented in the

For him The experiment took into account considerations in terms of environment,
endowment, application preferences and methodology described below:
Around
For the application of the experiment, two events of relevant importance are attended in the
electrical sector, carried out in November and December 2019.
These events bring together a significant number of professionals with the appropriate profile
for the application of the experiment, including engineers knowledgeable in the electrical sector,
heads of production areas, engineers responsible for projects and general staff
with decision-making power. The events where the experiment took place were:
● Regional Smart Grids Workshop, Cali. November 25, 2019
● FISE - IEEE/CIGRE CONFERENCE 2019. December 4 to 6, Plaza Mayor de
conventions - Medellín, Colombia
For the application of the experiment, the following equipment was available: Chapter 3 - Design and Implementation of Experimental Practice 77
● Infrastructure: hall/auditorium with availability for 60 people, suitable for
participants with tables, chairs, equipment, etc.
● Computer equipment with internet access, audio and projection equipment, microphone.
It was considered sufficient to have 5 computers with Internet access for the
application of the experiment.
● Logistics: attendee registration area, coffee area
● Material: slide presentation with the explanation of the experiment
experimental economy, sheets and pens to include recommendations to the survey
applied.
Regarding the preferences for the application of the experiment, the following were considered:
following:
● Application of the experiment through an online survey, in order to
to optimize times in the analysis of the results obtained
● The survey is applied to professionals with some decision-making power in the
organizations to which they belong. The above, given that it seeks to establish
the relationship between decision making and intuition versus decision making with
evidence given by the information of the organization's processes.
In relation to the nature of the payments of the experiment, a box was delivered
of chocolates valued at 10 USD to each participant, delivered at the end of the execution
of the activity.
Experiment design
Surveys were conducted aimed at organizations in the electricity sector in Colombia, for
through the participation of its business executives with tactical decision-making power and
strategic. The surveys were designed on the Google Forms online platform and
were applied in the aforementioned events.
During the session, a context presentation of the experiment is made, indicating the
objective and establishing the basic rules for the application of the experiment. It was used
an execution time of 30 minutes for each of the two days. Besides, the
survey specified instructions specifying the application procedure.
Additionally, each session was accompanied by 2 support professionals for the
resolution of concerns.78 Digital Transformation and Organizational Performance in Companies in the Healthcare Sector
Electric power
In the instrument (survey) 2 scenarios were presented so that according to the
given conditions, the decision making of each professional will be carried out, tending to analyze
subsequently whether or not the participant used the information provided for each
scenery.
The context corresponds to a daily situation in the electrical sector that requires the taking
of decision. The first scenario considers the context given without information, that is, that
The context is presented and the participant is sought to make the decision based on the
interaction of your intuition, your prior knowledge, experience, emotions and
sensations, product of working under pressure.
For its part, the second scenario includes relevant information about the organization and
inputs that come from assumed data, in order to obtain a decision making
based on the use of the information present.
Before applying the final survey, a validation pilot application is carried out, with the
in order to make modifications to the final instrument, eliminating ambiguities and simplifying
interpretation, validating content, scope and purpose. The pilot is applied to 12
master's students from the Faculty of Sciences of the National University of
Colombia, which provided feedback on the design of the proposed instrument, giving as
result of the survey finally applied.
The experiment allows the participants to be divided into three groups (A, B and C),
in order to deliver different criteria and statements for decision making, of the
Following way:
● Group A: the decision-making context is provided and no criteria or statements
additional.
● Group B: the decision-making context and 3 supporting criteria are provided
related to economic aspects of the solution.
● Group C: the decision-making context and 12 supporting criteria are provided
related to social, experimental, economic, regulatory and
technological.
At the beginning of the experiment, each participant is assigned a group for analysis purposes.
resulting information. The survey is divided into 3 sections, the first includes information
general, related to personal, educational and employment data. The second, with the
content of the decision context and the supporting criteria/statements for each group.Chapter 3 - Design and Implementation of Experimental Practice 79
The last one compiles all the criteria and supporting statements for decision making and is
asks all participants, regardless of the group to which they have been
linked, to select those that were taken into account when making the decision
execution or not of the project. The detail of the applied instrument and its sections is
presented in Annex A.
4.2 Analysis of Results
The pr procedures for executing the experiment, which are standardized with the
proposed environment, included the definition of:
● Step-by-step explanation of the experiment
● Data collection: this was done online.
● Storage: data and results were saved online
additional information generated automatically by the online Google Forms tool.
● Data treatment: through tables and graphs that best represent
way the results obtained.
● Debugging: erroneous data and responses to decision making are excluded
Without justification.
● Payments: were made once the session ended.
● Data verification: considered the most important part of the process. For
The refined data is then graphed, so that the experimenter can visually
detect points that may indicate erroneous data. If these data are
distorted in some way, the experimenter reviews the method used to
the analysis of the cleaned data or cites the findings faithfully.
Below are the results obtained for each group of the experiment:
Assigned group
The group assignment was done so that there was an equal proportion for
each group. Therefore, it was achieved that the distribution was on average 33.3%. The
distribution is presented in Figure 4-2.
Figure 4-2. Assignment of groups to participants80 Digital Transformation and Organizational Performance in Companies in the Healthcare Sector
Electric power
Where, Group A corresponds to the participants who did not have information or
specific criteria for project decision making, Group B for those who
had some type of partial information and Group C to those who had the
totality of information provided for decision making.
The project decision making for each group is presented in Figure 4-3. Can
show that all participants in Group A, who did not have information,
opted for the execution of the project, which allows us to conclude that the decision was made
based on the previous conceptions of each participant.
Now, for groups B and C, which had information, the participants had
an approximate percentage of non-approval of the execution of the project in question. This
may be related to the specific information they took into account with criteria
that do not justify the viability of the project, and this shows the use of information
provided for decision making
Figure 4-3. Decision making for each group of the experimentChapter 3 - Design and Implementation of Experimental Practice 81
Decision making criteria
This section provided all the criteria provided to Group C plus
some additional ones, in order for all the participants in the experiment to select
the criteria or statements that were taken into account when making the decision on the
execution or not of the pr proposed project. From the responses obtained, it can be concluded that
the criteria and statements that were taken into account by the participants when making the
decision making in greater proportion are:
● Economic aspect: (14) Cost-Benefit Analysis for the city of
implementation with 63.6%
● Regulatory aspect: (8) Law 1964 of 2019 with 59.1%
● Aspects associated with technology: (12) Autonomy of electric vehicles
(EVs) vs average end user journeys with 45.5%
The criteria that had a participation between 36.4% and 40.9% are the following:
● Economic aspects of the technology: (7) decrease in battery cost
(36.4%)
● Regulatory aspect: (9) Decree 1116 of 2017: tariff levy (36.4%)
● Economic aspects: (3) time to return on investment (40.9%)
● Economic aspects: (10) operating cost of an electric vehicle (40.9%)
● Technological - economic aspect: (11) optimal management system - reduction
investment cost (40.9%)
● Technological aspect: (13) technology maturity (40.9%)
Finally, the criteria that had the least participation, between 4.5% and 13.6% for
decision making are:
● Impression of technology: (2) technology not mature enough with 4.5%
● Others: 2 participants added other criteria associated with their choice. These are:
○ “The project presents positive financial indicators for the company.
Additionally, it can become a flagship project for the
promotion of electric mobility, contributing to the massification of the
technology, contributing to the environment, among others” (4.5%)82 Digital Transformation and Organizational Performance in Companies in the Healthcare Sector
Electric power
○ “Corporate image and the company, being in the electrical sector, must give a
example to follow on how to apply this technology” (4.5%)
● Perception of competitors: (1) Competing company did not achieve results
expected (13.6%)
● Environmental aspects: (4) insufficient final disposal of batteries (13.6%)
● Regulatory aspects: (5) Incipient regulation and regulations (13.6%)
● Economic aspects: (6) Investment cost (13.6%)
It should be taken into account that participants could select more than one criterion and/or
affirmation. Therefore, the sum of the individual percentages does not correspond to 100%.
Figure 4-4 presents the criteria that the participants took into account when making the
decision about whether or not to execute the context project.
Figure 4-4. Selected criteria for decision making
It is possible to identify that the aspects that were least taken into account at the time of the
decision making were those related to the impression of the technology (maturity
insufficient), the perception of competitors (competitor company did not reach the
projected results), environmental aspects (referring to the final disposal of
insufficient batteries), emerging regulatory and policy issues, and the cost of capital. Chapter 3 - Design and Implementation of Experimental Practice 83
the investment. This shows that the participants do not use the information to a large extent.
of assumptions, stories and perceptions without true and confirmed information.
On the other hand, participants largely selected the criteria associated with the
technology with information on the autonomy of electric vehicles (EVs) vs.
average routes of the organization, the regulatory aspect of Law 1964 of 2019
which promotes the use of both public and private EVs and the aspect related to
the cost-benefit analysis. This is possibly because with accurate and reliable information
technological context supported by previous tests and results allows us to have a guarantee
and generates confidence when making decisions.
In a medium proportion, the economic and technological aspects took precedence over the
moment of decision making. The economic aspects focused on the decrease
of the cost of the battery, the payback time and the cost of operating a
electric vehicle and technological ones in the maturity of technology and systems
optimal management have greater weight because it is information usually found in
media of general interest, of public knowledge, massive and easily accessible.
Finally, it is evident that the criteria and statements provided had a
direct consequence in the decision to execute or not the silver project, so it is
infers that information has an implicit relationship in decision making. Given this
panorama, it is necessary to formulate hypotheses that allow establishing a relationship
existing between information and organizational performance, having as a reference the
implicit relationship with decision making. Information supported by the initiatives of
digital transformation, according to the review presented in the previous chapters and
taking as a reference decision making as a support for generation of
competitive advantages within the organization that in turn provide an improvement in
organizational performance.5. Chapter 5 - Model
Structural Equations
In the previous chapters, conceptual issues related to the
themes of Digital Transformation and Organizational Performance, establishing in the
search equation maps from the Systematic Literature Review the link
direct between Big Data and Digital Transformation initiatives. The proposed model is
based on establishing the relationship between Big Data as a relevant part of the Transformation
Digital and the organizational performance of companies.
Subsequently, after reviewing the theories of DC, RBV and KBV, it is determined to propose
a heterogeneous structural equation model that includes the contribution of the three
methodologies, taking as a starting point experiments and validations analyzed in
the reference articles.
Additionally e, it is decided to carry out an experimental practice in order to check if the
information is used for decision making to support performance
organizational. Based on the evidence that the information provided has an impact on the
decision making, a link with organizational performance can be assumed.
In accordance with the above, this chapter proposes an equation model
structural that relates between digital transformation with a central axis of Big Data and
Organizational Performance. Constructs related to transformation are presented
digital and organizational performance used in the formulation of the equation model

This model presents the relationship that exists between resources, transformation elements

mediator of the implementation of BDA.Chapter 4 - Design and implementation of Experimental Practice 85
Finally, an instrument is applied in order to validate the proposed model and establish
the preponderant relationships of the model.
5.1 Constructs of the Organization that
take advantage of Digital Transformation -
Constructs
For the construction of the Structural Equations model, the
constructs associated with Digital Transformation and with elements of the organization with
in order to develop constructs/hypotheses that relate to each of the elements of the
structural equation model.
Each construct is considered as an element of the proposed model and subsequently
The relationships present between each element are analyzed through constructs, to
then carry out the corresponding assessment using an instrument completed by
experts from the electrical sector in order to validate the model.
The constructs that relate to each other to give rise to the proposed constructs
For the development of the model they are classified as follows:
1. Constructs associated with Digital Transformation
to. Big Data (BD): Big Data can be created from a large collection
of sensors, databases, emails, websites, images and
social networks. The challenges of Big Data are visualization, extraction,
analysis, capture, storage, search and sharing of data
(Mohanty et al., 2016).
Big data can help address critical predictive analytics challenges
that refer to the capture, storage, transfer and sharing
data (system architecture), and search, analysis and visualization
(data analysis) (H. Chen et al., 2012; Erevelles et al., 2016).
b. BDA (Big Data Analytics): It is associated with the transformation and analysis of
raw data into valuable information, as well as knowledge into
creation of commercial values. It includes determining factors such as
Quality of data and information are critical to ra the impact
organizational structure, which will facilitate senior management in decision-making.86 Digital Transformation and Organizational Performance in Companies in the Healthcare Sector
Electric power
Previous studies have shown that BDA quality factors
consist of data quality, information quality, and quality
of the system (Adrian et al., 2018).
BDA is an umbrella term for techniques intended to handle large
data characterized in terms of high volume, velocity and variety (Cha
& Cha, 2014; Gunasekaran et al., 2017; Merendino et al., 2018).
The BDA, as part of the digital transformation, offers companies
business-focused practices and methodologies, providing a
competitive advantage in data-based decision making, which allows
improve business efficiency and effectiveness due to its high potential
operational and strategic (Côrte-Real et al., 2017; Gunasekaran et al., 2017).
BDA is a resource with multiple use potential to solve various
issues.
c. BDA Capabilities: An organization's ability to take advantage of
resources associated with large volumes of data and information in the
compliance with strategic objectives and process improvement
of business (Correa Ospina, Martha Liliana; Díaz Pinzón, 2018; Gunasekaran
et al., 2017). BDA capabilities are a set of capabilities that
can help an organization adapt an existing resource base
to address different information needs that support the making
decision (Rialti et al., 2019).
Akter et al., 2016 and Wamba et al., 2017 indicate that BDA capabilities
cover dimensions of management, talent and technology, which influence
positively on organizational performance (Adrian et al., 2018)
In (Adrian et al., 2018) 3 commonly used definitions are presented,
found after a systematic review of the literature:
● Competence to provide business information using the
data management capacity, talent (personal context) and
infrastructure (technological context) to transform the business of

2. Constructs associated with Organizational Performance
to. Organizational Agility: Dynamic capacity that accelerates processes or
simplifies the way of working to generate agility from the point of view
strategic, operational and cultural. It seeks to develop the capacity of
detect and respond to important changes in the environment, taking advantage of the
diversity to exploit opportunities and learn to build prototypes
quickly and institutionalize success stories.
In (Côrte-Real et al., 2017) organizational agility is tested to
determine its role as a mediator of knowledge assets about the
process-level performance and competitive advantage.
b. Decision Making: According to (Brous, Janssen, & Herder, 2019),
could be divided into:
● Decision making for performance management (Archetti et al.,
2015): decision-making processes regarding 88 Digital Transformation and Organizational Performance in Companies in the Healthcare Sector
Electric power
maintenance of current service levels. Centered on
prevent malfunction or failure of assets or evaluate
quickly damage to infrastructure after an event,
so that maintenance procedures can be directed to
the areas that need immediate attention (Aono, Lajnef, Faridazar,
& Chakrabartty, 2016; Brous et al., 2019).
● Decision making to manage how services are perceived
infrastructure (Hentschel et al., 2016): important aspect for
the asset management decision-making process, as the
effectiveness of the different facets of the performance system
often depends on competition, training and motivation
of the people who interact with the infrastructure and systems
of asset management (Brous et al., 2019; Õrjan, 1998).
● Decision making to improve infrastructure services:
Have a strategic perspective for asset management, such as
for example, detections of damage or infrastructure failures
critical public can have important social and
economic (Brous et al., 2019; Koo, Piratla, & Matthews, 2015)
c. Sustainable competitive advantages: their existence is assumed when a
company reveals to be more successful compared to its competitors
current or potential (Peteraf & Barney, 2003). Better performance with
relation to that of competitors, which constitutes an empirical indicator and
common competitive advantage. Competitive advantage is understood to be
better strategic performance is achieved (qualitative dimension) and
financial performance (quantitative dimension) compared to the
competition (Côrte-Real et al., 2017).
d. Performance at the process level: it is determined, among others, by having
continuous improvements in production and operations, increased
labor productivity, improvement in flexibility and equipment utilization
and tools, streamlining operations.
Obtaining product and service improvements: by including technological improvements
and information in products, increase the pace of development, researchChapter 4 - Design and implementation of Experimental Practice 89
and development, monitor design cost, improve quality, support
innovation. As well as, carry out marketing and sales strategies, in order to
to discover market trends, anticipate customer needs,
customers, increase market share, improve the accuracy of
forecasts and evaluate pricing options. Additionally, the
Process performance is impacted by customer relationships:
responding to customer needs, providing service and
after-sales support, improving distribution and generating customer loyalty
client (Côrte-Real et al., 2017).
and. Financial Performance: Refers to the measurements of the
operations and policies of an organization in monetary terms, such as,
for example: profits, return on assets, return on investment, value
added, among others. Indicators that are continually above the
industry average such as EBIT (earnings before interest and
taxes), return on investment (ROI) and return on sales (ROS) give
shows better financial performance than competitors (Côrte-Real
et al., 2017).
F. Strategic Performance: Schilke, 2014 includes obtaining
strategic advantages over competitors, a large market share and
more successful than major competitors as indicators of better
strategic performance.
g. Organizational Performance (OP): Market share or share
average, the average sales volume and the average growth of the
sales, indicators that reflect the degree to which the organization
performs better than its competitors (Whitten et al., 2012). He
organizational performance involves planners in its development
strategic, operations managers, financial directors, advisors
legal, businessmen (owners of the organization), among others.
3. Constructs associated with Resources
to. Technology and infrastructure: dimension that integrates the elements of the
execution of data analytics, which include infrastructures
of IT, information processing, data governance and management90 Digital Transformation and Organizational Performance in Companies in the Information Sector

the quality of the data (Adrian et al., 2018). Technology capabilities
include infrastructure flexibility, integration and standardization of
processes, integration of computer systems, effective use z of the
data aggregation tools, effective use of data aggregation tools
data analysis and data interpretation tools (Adrian et
al., 2018)
b. Human resources: Contains the collaborative factor of the worker in the
knowledge, which is determined by the size of the people who
refers to the skills of the personnel who perform the data analysis,
the organizational relationship and analytics culture (Adrian et al., 2018).
c. Information Exchange (IS): Premkumar and King (1994) define IS
as organizational capital that focuses on the flow of information, (Li, Liu,
Belitski, Ghobadian, & O’Regan, 2016).
According to Grant, resources are created to create capabilities and
taking into account that the exchange of information allows this in the
organization, then the IS is considered a resource (Gunasekaran et al.,
2017).
d. Connectivity (C): Organizational resource that focuses on satisfying the
communication requirements of information systems, the integration of
information applications within the organization and the supply chain
supply. Likewise, guarantee the existence of links of security systems
appropriate information with supply chain network partners
(Gunasekaran et al., 2017)
4. TD Strategy (Organization): The Digital Transformation Strategy is a factor
important in the dimension of the organization. It refers to the guarantee of the
organizations to perform strategic analytical alignment, commitment
management and resource management (Adrian et al., 2018). The management of these resources
BDA includes technology and infrastructure, human resources and the development of
competencies.
5. Knowledge Management: Knowledge management is a discipline that
makes it easy to create, store, transfer and apply
knowledge in organizations. Knowledge management isChapter 4 - Design and implementation of Experimental Practice 91
multidisciplinary and there are different perspectives of management models of the
knowledge that can be grouped into (Briceño Moreno & Bernal Torres, 2010).
Knowledge management is a systematic process that creates value from the
collective experience of an organization and its personal competencies,
technological and organizational.
Knowledge management plays a fundamental role in management
efficient data collection and proper delivery to end users to support
business processes. Knowledge management enables capabilities
dynamic by offering specific functional competencies that can improve the
business performance (Pisano et al., 1997).
For the previous constructs, hypotheses are established that allow evidence of the relationship
between each of them, in order to determine if there is a correlation between Transformation
Digital and Organizational Performance by examining relationships and dependents, evaluating
contribution and reliability ity of the constructs and established hypotheses.
The construction of the constructs and hypotheses is done from the review of the
RSL publications and conclusions. The 27 proposed constructs are presented in the

5.2 Structural Equations Model
Next, the proposal for the structural equation model is presented, based
in the theory of Dynamic Capabilities, DC, and including elements of the organization
associated with resources and knowledge. The proposed model is made up of 17
constructs related to each other through 27 hypotheses.
Consequently, the influence of BDA is evident, based on a Strategy of
Digital Transformation, which permeates the management of the organization's resources in:
● The effect on decision-making effectiveness
● Effect on the generation of sustainable competitive advantages, through the
Leveraging Knowledge Management and supported by capacity

● Performance Improvements at the process level through Organizational Agility,
which is strengthened by Knowledge Management and the proper management of
the available resources
● Impact on Organizational Performance by obtaining improvements in the items
anteri ores: decision making, competitive advantages and performance at the level of
process.
In this line it is possible to establish the existing relationship between Digital Transformation and
Organizational Performance, taking BDA as a central focus. Links are established
between the constructs associated with TD and OP, based on dynamic capabilities and strengthened
through the interaction between Knowledge Management and the Organization's Resources.

5.3 Validation of the Equation Model
Structural
To carry out a validation of the proposed Structural Equations Model, in which
The relationship that exists between resources, elements of digital transformation is presented.
focused on Big Data and organizational performance, a survey was carried out that was
answered by expert professionals in the electrical sector.
The profile of the professionals selected to complete the survey were professionals
at the strategic level of the organization that make decisions to develop policies and
strategies, and tactical level of coordination and supervision of projects that you have a
relationship with the use of ICT. The work areas of the selected professionals are
from process management, ICT managers, human resources, management of
projects and technological innovation. The professionals were identified from the base of
data built by professionals from different companies in the energy sector
electricity, who have participated in workshops and national discussion forums on Smart Grids
since 2012 by the UPME and the research group Research Group:
Electrical Machines & Drives, EM&D. Finally, of the 50 invitations to professionals from the
electric energy sector to answer the survey, 36 professionals evaluated the
constructs and hypotheses of the model.
The instrument allowed us to give a weight to each of the 27 hypotheses that are proposed.
as a relationship between each element of the proposed model. This in order to establish the
preponderant relationships of the model. The survey presents the Equation Model
Structural proposed, which is made up of 17 interrelated constructs
through 27 hypotheses. Participants were asked to assign a rating between
0 and 10 for each construct (hypotheses from H1 to H27 that relate two elements
of the model) and the assigned values ​​adjust to the indicative scale in Table 5-7.
Table 5-7. Indicative scale to group the responses obtained in the survey.
Figure 5-2 presents the grouping of the ratings given by the participants of

quartiles, indicating within each box the median of the data. The lines that
extend from the box, they correspond to the maximum and minimum values ​​of the ratings.
For the validation of the proposed model, the constructs whose
The median is within the Strong Relationship range of the indicative scale. Therefore, it
will include all constructs with a median greater than or equal to 8.0.
Figure 5-2 shows that construct H7 has a median of 7.0, therefore
this relationship is discarded in the final model. The other constructs of the model present
a median within the range established as valid. However, the construct H11
presents a great dispersion of the data by finding the Q1 quartile (25% of the data) in
a value of 56.25, generating a wide interquartile range (Q3–Q1) that allows visualization
a great dispersion of the ratings for this construct, within the scale of
moderate to strong relationship. Therefore, it is not also taken into account for the model.

between Digital Transformation and Organizational PerformanceChapter 4 - Design and implementation of Experimental Practice 99
Figure 5-3. Validated conceptual model of the relationship between Digital Transformation and
Organizational Performance
In this validated model, the relationships given by constructs H7 and H11 were eliminated:
 H7: BD allows the creation of Information Exchange (IS)
 H11: Connectivity is positively related to BDA acceptance.
Without the H7 construct it becomes evident that the information to be exchanged is not required.
must be exclusively of large volumes of information, giving rise to the existence
the exchange of information of any amount of data, whether or not they are part of initiatives
of Big Data. By eliminating the relationship given by H11, connectivity is presented as a mediator
between technology and infrastructure and the exchange of information, giving meaning to the flow
of information to BDA through the link that allows connectivity. Therefore,
the final proposed conceptual model obtained in the present study after the
validation is presented in Figure 5-4.100 Digital Transformation and Organizational Performance in Companies in the Healthcare Sector
Electric power
Figure 5-4. Proposed final conceptual model obtained after validation
In the final model formulated it is evident that the Digital Transformation strategy influences
directly in the associated constructs to the management of resources, both physical
(technologies and infrastructure) as well as those associated with human resources, establishing
its direct relationship with these through the construct H2. Furthermore, the strategy of
organization is responsible for ensuring strategic IT flexibility, enabling
BDA business partnership and alignment, through senior management commitment
and its management responsibility. This partnership and alignment of businesses associated with BDA,
makes possible the direct relationship with BDA through construct H1.
Technology and infrastructure resources include IT deployment capabilities,
infrastructure flexibility, integration and standardization capabilities
processes, integration of computer systems, the effective use of
data aggregation, data analysis tools and their interpretation. This
allows us to display the relationships with BD (construct H3) and with connectivity (construct
H4)
For its part, human resources group the analysis capabilities of personnel
associated with TD initiatives, the organizational relationship, staff skills,
analytics culture and the organizational relationship for the development of functions
assigned. Elements that allow developing the analytics present in BDA (construct
H5) and generate the dynamic capacity of Organizational Agility (construct H6). Chapter 4 - Design and implementation of Experimental Practice 101
After the elimination of constructs H7 and H11, a relationship was generated between technology
and infrastructure and BDA through the mediation of connectivity and exchange of
information, where data are considered assets of organizations that at the same time
generating the appropriate flow of information can provide competitive advantages to the
take this information into account when making decisions.
According to the validation carried out, Figure 5-3 shows strong acceptance
of the direct relationship between BD and BDA (construct H9 with a median of 100%), taking
as the foundation of the preceding relationship of the H3 construct between Technology and
Infrastructure and Big Data.
From BDA, the relationship with BDA capabilities is validated with a measure of
85% that is supported by the construct H12, which establishes that the diffusion of BDA
positively influences the creation of BDA Capabilities. These capabilities correspond
to the transformation and analysis of data and is based on the adaptation of existing resources,
support decision making, and management, talent and technology. Consequently, from
of BDA capabilities, the implementation of BDA is proposed in construct H14,
with the management of the generated capacities, the management of BDA resources and guaranteeing
the quality of data analytics.
As a consequence of the capabilities of BDA and its implementation, the
relationships with knowledge management, through the constructs H13 and H15
respectively. Where this management corresponds to the creation, storage,
transfer and application of knowledge, with efficient management functionalities
data and proper delivery to end users (knowledge sharing).
Knowledge management establishes a positive influence on dynamic capacity
organizational agility (H16), which allows detecting and responding to changes in the
environment, simplifying ways of working and accelerating processes.
This agility positively impacts performance at the process level, providing
improvements in supply chain performance (SCP), in production and
operations, increasing labor productivity and the offer of products and services (H20)
For its part, decision making mediated by the implementation of BDA (construct
H17) generates sustainable competitive advantages in organizations (H21), this allows

where criteria and statements as information provision influenced decision making
final decision.
Now, decision making is considered as a link and support for the
generation of sustainable competitive advantages, an element that becomes a focus
important part of the model, as it is mediated by the direct influence of the management of the
knowledge (H18), organizational agility (H19) performance at the process level (H22)
and decision-making itself (H21). Therefore, competitive advantages group together the
related to the improvement of financial performance (H23) with indicators such as
reducing supply chain costs and generating efficient operations
and economic policies that generate value for the organization. Furthermore, they are associated with
strategic performance (H24) with the strengthening of relationships with suppliers, the
planning improvement and the strategic advantages generated on the
competitors.
The influence of performance at the process (H25), financial (H26) and strategic levels
(H27) contribute positively to organizational performance, which provides value
in business strategy, involves planners, managers, directors,
advisors, businessmen, among others. Likewise, it allows gathering indicators for measuring
performance against competitors, such as quotas or participation of
average market, average sales volume and average sales growth.
Organizational performance is transversally impacted by the elements
technological and infrastructure associated with Digital Transformation, human resources
and their skills, data analytics capabilities and their impact on the processes at hand.
process level and finally s about the organization's strategy, which integrates,
builds, reorganizes and reconfigures internal and external competencies to adapt to
the environments of change, as posed by the dynamic capabilities presented
previously.
In conclusion, we can highlight the proposed model that shows the articulation of the
resource-based theories, managed by TD strategy, vision-based
knowledge through the integration of knowledge management with
BDA capabilities and their implementation. In addition, the boost in dynamic capacity
of organizational agility through knowledge management by providing
BD tools and their direct influence with human resources to generate the Chapter 4 - Design and implementation of Experimental Practice 103

The classification is made by each participant based on the following information:
● Strategic level: Develops policies and strategies. Determine the objectives you long
term and the way in which the organization has to interact with other entities. HE
They make decisions that affect the entire organization.
● Operational level: Its function is to efficiently carry out the tasks carried out in
the organization. Routine tasks scheduled by the tactical level of the
company.
● Tactical level: Coordinates the activities that are carried out at the operational level, as well as
as the decisions that are made and that affect a sector, area or department
specific. At this level is the production manager, administration of
sales, etc.

Summary
Development of a digital transformation model of geographic data through
of Information and Communications Technologies (ICTs).
Use case: Cartography and Geological and Geomorphological Research Group
of the Colombian Geological Service (SGC)
Currently, Information and Communications Technologies (ICTs) are
immersed in a broad technological, social and economic context that has enhanced their use
in research processes and in the development of digital transformation projects. Is
essential, therefore, for organizations to improve methods, work flows,
manage data and automate processes through the implementation of solutions
based on digital technologies. On the other hand, there is a growing use in
geographic data organizations in their missional processes, and a
lack of guidelines and instruments that guide intervention for this type of
data, in terms of digital transformation.
Responding to this lack, the contribution of this research is the development of
a digital transformation model for geographic data through ICTs. In case of
study was the Cartography and Geological and Geomorphological Research Group of the SGC.
The model, which has been called Geo-TD, is based on the characterization and prioritization of
processes by calculating the level of digital maturity in 4 dimensions: people
and digital culture, digital data and analytics, digital processes and technology. In addition,
encompasses the architectural metamodel that drives the definition of components
technological for the design and construction of the validation technological platform. Geo-
TD centralizes geographic data in one system, avoids duplication of records, makes
better use of storage resources, eliminates the use of local files and allows
consult historical works without wasting effort and resources. Geo-TD is also a
replicable model that can adapt to any scenario that handles data
geographical.

Abstract
Development of a Digital Transformation Model for Geographic Data through
Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs).
Case study: Cartography and Geological and Geomorphological Research Group of
the Colombian Geological Service (SGC)
Currently, In formation and Communications Technologies (ICTs) are immersed in a broad
technological, social, and economic context that has enhanced their use in research
processes and in the development of digital transformation projects. It is therefore essential
for organizations to improve methods, workflows, manage data, and automate processes
through the implementation of digital technology-based solutions. On the other hand, there
is a growing use of geographic data in mission processes in organizations, and there is a
lack of guidelines and tools to guide intervention for this type of data in the field of digital
transformation.
In response to this lack, the contribution of this research is the development of a digital
transformation model for geographic data through ICTs. The case study was the Grupo de
Cartografía e Investigación Geológica y Geomorfológica of the SGC. The model, which has
been called Geo-TD, is based on the characterization and prioritization of processes
through the calculation of the level of digital maturity in 4 dimensions: people and digital
culture, digital data and analytics, digital processes, and technology. It also covers the
metamodel of architecture that leads to the definition of technological components for the
design and construction of the validation technology platform. Geo-TD centralizes
geographic data in a system, avoids duplication of records, makes better use of storage
resources, eliminates the use of local files, and allows historical work to be consulted
without duplicating effort and resources. Geo-TD is also a replicable model that can be
adapted to any scenario that handles geographic data.

4RI Fourth Industrial Revolution1. Introduction
1.1 General context
Within the framework of the Fourth Industrial Revolution (hereinafter 4IR) or industry 4.0,
Information and Communications Technologies (hereinafter ICTs) are made up of
basic elements through which it is possible to strengthen the capacities and
organizational competencies, allowing to improve, contribute, propose and articulate methods,
ways of working, innovations and technologies (Tota et al., 2020).
The 4IR has been oriented towards the development of intelligent systems, process automation,
Big Data and analytics, Artificial Intelligence (hereinafter AI), augmented reality, modeling
and virtual simulation, additive manufacturing, among others (Becerra, 2020), all of them fields and
technologies that capture and/or manage digital data.
Consequently, solutions based on digital technologies are essential in
organizations to optimize methods, workflows, data management, perform
Appropriate transition from analogue processes to more accurate digital processes and enable
ways and means so that they can be processed by machines (OECD, 2019b).
In that sense and considering that Geographic Information (hereinafter GI) is
fundamental for the cartographic representation of the territory, Information Science
Geographic, it is not alien to this technological trend that appears in the current context,
more like a paradigmatic field that leads to the generation of specific processes
that guarantee the quality of geographical data and promote its use and exploitation
through ICTs.20 Development of a digital transformation model of geographic data through
of Information and Communications Technologies (ICTs)
1.2 Background
The OECD (OECD for its acronym Organization for Cooperation and Development
Economics) presents within its projects the IDG (IDG for its acronym Index of
Digital Government), which measures the level of “digital maturity” of government strategies
digital for member countries and, based on the results, supports the design of
strong initiatives that support digital policies and practices of ca country (OECD,
2020).
Added to the above are the IMD World Digital Competitiveness Ranking (IMD for its
acronym Institute for Management Development), which sets out criteria to measure the
ability of an economy to adopt and explore digital technologies that lead to
transformation in government practices, business models and society
in general (IMD World Competitiveness Center, 2018, as cited in DNP, 2019) and the
e-Goverment Development index, which shows the state of government development
electronic in the member countries of the UN (UN for its acronym Organization of the
United Nations). (DNP, 2019).
In relation to this, ECLAC (ECLAC by its acronym Economic Commission for the Americas)
Latin America and the Caribbean), publishes in 2021 the report: “Data and facts about the transformation
digital”, in which it presents the main indicators regarding the adoption of
digital technologies and exposes the current situation in Latin America and the Caribbean, in
different levels of technology use and development (ECLAC, 2021).
The design and formulation of international criteria and indices to promote processes
of digital transformation in the regions, confirms the need to adopt policies and
government strategies, so that public organizations get involved
proactively in the implementation and monitoring of digital technologies and allow
strengthen institutional and national capacities.
Colombia, through the Ministry of Information and Communications Technologies
(MinTIC) is responding to the barriers and challenges posed within the framework of the 4IR,
adopting and implementing the Digital Government Policy that aims to
“Promote the use and exploitation of information technologies and technologiesChapter 1 21
communications to consolidate a competitive, proactive State and citizens, and
innovative, that generate public value in an environment of digital trust” (MinTIC,
2020a).
In that sense, the Colombian State, through the DNP and CONPES (CONPES for its
acronym National Council of Economic and Social Policy), has developed documents that
reinforce and enhance the use of digital data for decision making in the
appropriate processes.
CONPES document 3975 of 2019: Policy for digital transformation and intelligence
artificial, establishes the conditions to enhance the generation of social and economic value,
through the strategic use of digital technologies and promoting artificial intelligence in
the framework for taking advantage of the opportunities and challenges of ICT.
On the other hand, document CONPES 3585 of 2009: Consolidation of national policy
of geographic information and the ICDE (ICDE for its acronym Colombian Infrastructure of
Spatial Data), seeks to strengthen the production, exchange, access and use of GI in the
State entities and promote the development of the ICDE as a mechanism for the
harmonization and standardization of information geographic ation (DNP, 2009).
In section A: Diagnosis of the chapter of guidelines for the consolidation of the ICDE
of CONPES 3585 of 2009, it is indicated that the central problem in the management of GI in the
different levels of the State, is the disarticulation in production, availability, access
and use of GI; which leads to: the loss of the GI due to the lack of application of
software standards and tools, having outdated IG and partial coverage
of the territory due to the application of poorly structured plans and out of a context
strategic, failures in the articulation between entities generating GI to develop
projects in a common objective, deficiency in the quality of the GI due to the low level of
design and application of production standards, documentation, access and use of the GI,
among others.22 Development of a digital transformation model of geographic data through
of Information and Communications Technologies (ICTs)
1.3 Problem formulation
The Colombian Congress issues the National Development Plan 2018-2022 "Pact for
Colombia, pact for equity", through Law 1955 of 2019 - article 147, in which
establishes: “State entities of the national order must incorporate into their
respective action plans the digital transformation component following the
standards defined for this purpose by the Ministry of Information Technologies
and Communications”. To achieve this, strategic digital transformation projects
must be guided by 13 principles described in this Law, which seek to guarantee
the use and exploitation of the data infrastructure through standards,
models, standards and tools for risk management and digital security, prioritize
interoperability between information systems and platforms for data exchange,
promote the use of technologies based on free software or open source and technologies
emerging 4IR, such as: DLT (Distributed Ledger
Technology), massive data analysis (Big Data), AI (AI for its acronym Artificial Intelligence),
IoT (IoT for its acronym Internet of Things), Robotics and similar and promoting programs
of use of technologies for citizen participation and open government in processes
missions of public entities (DNP, 2019, p47).
In short, this law determines that in all scenarios the digital transformation must
incorporate the components associated with emerging technologies, defined as those
of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, among others (DNP, 2019, p47).
Under this approach, state entities have focused their strategic plans on
modernization and digital transformation. The IGAC (IGAC by its acronym Geographic Institute
Agustín Codazzi), entity in charge of producing, researching, regulating, disposing and
disseminate geographic, cartographic, agrological, cadastral, geodetic and
geospace technologies them for their application in knowledge management processes,
comprehensive planning and development of the country, has presented its Strategic Plan of
Information Technologies (PETI) 2018-2022 with the objective of generating the roadmap
that supports the modernization and digital transformation of the IGAC, in the consolidation of
their capabilities to fulfill their institutional goals and objectives, supported
in the intensive use of ICTs (IGAC, 2022). Chapter 1 23
Likewise, the SGC, in compliance with Law 1955 of 2019, presented in 2021, the version
4 of the PETI 2018-2022, which establishes the guiding document for projects of
technology as a contribution to the fulfillment of institutional objectives, based on the
enterprise architecture program in its second cycle (SGC, 2021). This document
describes the actions undertaken within the AEI (AEI for its acronym Architecture
Institutional Business), designed since 2014, through the support of the CIFI
(CIFI for its acronym Research Center of the Faculty of Engineering), of the University
of the Andes.
The AEI program was divided into 3 Phases, the first Phase was based on the
socialization of basic concepts of AEI, through the elaboration of the diagnosis of the
situation in 2014 (AS-IS Architecture) and the joint generation of the situation or state
desired (Architecture TO BE). The main product of this phase was the preparation of the
roadmap of 83 projects, grouped into 10 major initiatives on which the SGC
had to guide its efforts and strategies. Phase II (2014-2015) includes the
prioritization of architecture domains, in order to design and launch the pilot of
a highly scalable solution for earthquake-related information and transferring
appropriately the Petroleum Information Bank (BIP) between the National Agency of
Hydrocarbons (ANH) and the SGC. Finally, Phase III (2015-2018) continues with the
implementation of projects that allow the strengthening of information systems,
data and technological infrastructure at the institutional level (SGC, 2021).
The results of Cycle 1 of the AEI led to the development of technological tools,
web platforms, information systems, geoportals and geoviewers that integrate and
They provide geoscientific information for internal and external users. Next,
Some of them are presented: the Geoscientific Information Integration Engine (MIIG)
It brings together the official historical information in each project, the BIP is the official repository
of Colombia to safeguard and manage all the technical information resulting from the
exploratory and hydrocarbon production activities that take place in the
national territory, the Mass Movement Information System (SIMMA) allows
load, manage and consult the mass movements that occurred in Colombia for the
comprehensive risk management, territorial and environmental planning and planning
desa development, the BD EXPLORA database centralizes geochemical information data
for investigations and characterization of mineral resources. Additionally,24 Development of a digital transformation model of geographic data through
of Information and Communications Technologies (ICTs)
During this cycle, the strengthening and optimization of the infrastructure was carried out
technological by adapting a main data center for the operation and an alternate data center,
storage, communication, capacity and availability solutions for data
geoscientists in the developed tools (SGC, 2021).
In 2019, the SGC updates the AEI and proposes a second cycle, focused
in data analytics for management, which gathers, purifies and transforms data to
structured systems to describe, explore and analyze information through
control boards that support monitoring, follow-up, evaluation and control of objectives,
process, projects, users and resources of the QMS. On the other hand, data analytics
geoscientists allows applying multidisciplinary knowledge through processes of
analysis, interpretation, communication of spatial data, of different origin and format,
geostatistics 2D and 3D modeling and visualization so that researchers can
understand, explain, explore and predict the characteristics and behaviors of the
subsoil, the potential of its resources and threats of geological origin (SGC, 2021).
The SGC, within the framework of the initiatives to contribute to the AEI, has structured the IDE
Geoscientific aimed at facilitating the availability and access to spatial information,
To do this, it has been based on the guidelines of the Colombian Data Infrastructure
(ICDE) of the IGAC, which is the government strategy designed to integrate and
provide geographic information that promotes the generation of value in the territory (SGC,
2017).
In 2017, the ICDE presents the results obtained from the assessment carried out on the IDE
(SDI for its acronym Spatial Data Infrastructure) institutional of the SGC, which does not
It was formalized at the time of the evaluation (ICDE, 2017).
The methodology was based on the execution of interviews and work tables with the
QMS staff, in order to identify the degree of progress regarding the components:
Organizational, Human Resources, Information, Standards and ICT Services, from
the themes and indices defined as part of the Maturity Levels project of a
SDI. The maturity level was based on the weighting of each of the components,
whose sum is 100%, likewise, at each level (4 in total) a value was defined
minimum, depending on the themes identified in each one. Finally, the study and
diagnosis of the institutional IDE named as “Geoscientific IDE” showed as
resulted in an Advanced level of maturity, as a product of what was presented in Chapter 1 25
compose Organizational and Information entities: optimized, Human resources: medium,
ICT Standards and Services: advanced (ICDE, 2017). However, the ICDE recommends
generate technical specifications for the products that are generated, keep them updated
standards in accordance with current international regulations, enhance the
integration and systems developed to generate analysis tools, continue with
the enterprise architecture project, strengthen internal participation in the definition
of projects, in addition to citizen and private company participation, it is required
an information government articulated with business architecture and government
digital. The above recommendations are tasks the SGC has proposed to solve
through some proposals and initiatives.
Continuing with the strategies proposed by the SGC for digital transformation and
management of the Entity's data, was carried out through the CIFI of the University of the
Andes, the first evaluation of the data maturity level, with the purpose of knowing the
diagnosis of the QMS in this regard and, based on it, define a path for improvement
in the points that are weak in the measurement (UNIANDES, 2019).
The diagnosis of the maturity level of the QMS showed that it is at level 2,
called “Repeatable” according to the framework “Data Management Maturity (DMM) Model of the
CMMI Institute”, this level is defined as: “The process is sufficiently
developed and different people execute more or less the same procedures. No
there is no formal communication or development of competencies and capacities of the
procedures, and responsibility is individual. There is a great dependence on
knowledge that individuals have and, therefore, there is a probability of error
important". (UNIANDES, 2019).
The DMM (Data Maturity Model) applied is composed of 24
questions about different aspects of QMS data management, to carry out the
diagnose the current state of data management maturity and provide guidance
and recommendations of best practices to implement, to achieve maturity levels
superiors in data management (UNIANDES, 2019).26 Development of a digital transformation model of geographic data through
of Information and Communications Technologies (ICTs)
Figure 1: Result of the data management maturity level for the QMS.

Considering the above, it is evident that the actions undertaken by the
SGC in terms of digital transformation have been constant and are
framed mainly in the AEI, however, based on experience, as far as
set out in the SGC document: PETI 2018-2022, in the ICDE recommendations and in the
results of the evaluation of the level of data maturity for the QMS carried out by the
University of the Andes in 2019; the data has a probability of error important and in some cases they lack order, completeness, coherence, harmonization,
low level of detail and accuracy.
According to the above, is it possible to integrate data by implementing
geoscientific information analysis services? Is it possible to develop a model to
the transformation of geographic type data?”
To answer the previous questions, it is appropriate to propose the integration of
components based on ICTs with protocols and quality standards in the
acquisition, management and production of geographic data that allows supporting decision-making
decisions and adopt an innovative approach, based on rigorous and reliable data and,
based on technological trends as tools for planning and management of the
territory.
As a contribution to the solution of the problem evidenced by the diagnosis at the level
national and institutional, a model for Chapter 1 27 is proposed in this research work.

1.4 Conceptual and methodological approach
Digital transformation has been evaluated from different perspectives and scenarios, which
which involves diverse scopes and applications; For this reason, the conceptual review is
develops in accordance with the objectives set out in this work. This synthesis allows
relate to the terms and main axes of the research.
For this work, the main perspective is digital transformation models for
geographical data, however, as evidenced in the previous section and based on the
elaborated diagnosis, there is little literature that frames protocols, methods or
tools for the transformation of this type of data.
In that sense, according to the OECD (2020) “digital transformation refers to the effects
economic and social aspects of digitization and digitalization. Fingering is the conversion of
analogue data and processes into a machine-readable format. Digitization is the use
of digital technologies and data, as well as their interconnection, which generates new
activities or changes in existing ones”, for which a series of
initiatives to adopt a digital government and close the digital gaps identified in
the member countries of the Organization (OECD, 2020).
According to Vial (2019), digital transformation aims to provide changes
significant through the combination of computing, communication,
information and connectivity mainly impacting industries and society.
Some organizations see digital transformation as a means to optimize
business processes and reduce costs, while others they see it as a perspective
to design new value by providing services that do not exist (Dremel et al., 2017),
the modification or adaptation of information management or business models to
New technologies trigger changes in consumer behaviors and
of society (Parviainen et al., 2017)28 Development of a model for digital transformation of geographic data through
of Information and Communications Technologies (ICTs)
Many global corporations have experienced a variety of changes such as
result of the emergence of new technologies, globalization, changes in
customer needs and the implementation of new business models (Masuda
& Viswanathan, 2019). Table 1-1 shows the history of information systems
towards digital IT (IT for its acronym Information Technology). In the 1970s,
mainframe systems were used in companies. In the 1980s, the
Office computers were used with workstations and PCs. In the 1990s,

Internet of Things these days. Furthermore, great advances in technologies and
aforementioned processes have created a "digital IT economy", which features both
business opportunities as business risks, forcing companies to
innovate or face the consequences (Boardman & KPN, 2015).
Under this approach and considering that digital transformation drives digitalization and
Since digitalization uses data and technologies, it is appropriate to address ICTs, for which,
Tello (2007) mentions that they are a term that explores all forms of technology used
to create, store, exchange and process information in its various forms, such as
such as data, voice conversations, still or moving images, presentations
multimedia and other forms.
In this regard, Cruz Pérez et al. (2019) affirm that ICTs are producing innovation
in various social spheres; However, these changes do not always indicate a rejection
to previous technologies or means, but, in some cases, a kind of
of symbiosis with other media.
In the document “Profiling the digital transformation in Latin America” published by the
OECD (2020) mentions the most important technologies and applications that
drive the current digital transformation, which are: the smartphone, the Internet
of Things (IoT), big data analysis (Big Data), Artificial Intelligence (AI),
blockchain or distributed ledger technology (DLT). On the other hand, they add the
open source software, 5G networks, robotics, grid computing (GRID) and
neural computing, virtual reality, quantum computing, among others (OECD,
2019a). All of them constitute enabling technologies that drive the improvement of
workflow processes and data management in various scenarios.
ICTs refer to the wide range of computerized information technologies and
communication (Ongori & Migiro, 2010). These technologies include products and services
such as desktop computers, laptops, managed devices, wired intranet or
wireless, business productivity software such as editor and spreadsheet, software
business, data storage and network security, among others (Ashrafi & Murtaza,
2008).30 Development of a model for digital transformation of geographic data through
of Information and Communications Technologies (ICTs)
ICTs are the set of resources, tools, equipment, computer programs,
applications, networks and media; that allow the compilation, processing,
storage, transmission of information such as: voice, data, text, video and images
(Art. 6 Law 1341 of 2009).
Consequently, in this research work a model is defined that, in addition to
provide methodological tools for diagnose the digital maturity of
organizations that generate and use geographic information in their mission processes,
defines the process to carry out the digital transformation of this data through ICTs.
Taking into account the focus of this work, the methodological perspective was selected
of mixed research, in which, according to Creswell & Garrett (2008) “Mixed research
It is a design or methodology in which the researcher collects, analyzes and mixes (integrates or
connects) qualitative and quantitative data in a single study or in a program of
multi-phase inquiry.
1.5 Objectives

Information and Communications Technologies- ICTs. Use case: Group of
Cartography and Geological and Geomorphological Research of the Geological Service
Colombian (SGC).
1.5.2 Specific objectives
▪ Prepare the diagnosis of the current technological state of the digital transformation of
the data from the Cartography and Geological and Geomorphological Research Group of the
Colombian Geological Service (SGC), to identify the challenges in the
digitization of geographic data.
▪ Identify the conceptual and functional components based on ICTs, for the

1.6 Research question
Based on the above, the research question that guides this project is:
What methodological and conceptual elements can be incorporated into a model to
enhance the digital maturity of organizations that generate and use information
geographical in their missionary processes?
1.7 Justification
The publications (OECD, 2019b), (OECD, 2020), (MinTIC, 2020a), (ECLAC, 2021), the
CONPES documents 3975 of 2019 and 3585 of 2009, allow a diagnosis to be identified
initial based on initiatives, policies and guidelines to move towards maturity
digital at a national and international level.
In this way, Geographic Information Science provides methods, tools and
models that make geographic data available to minimize the problems of
uncertainty and articulation of the GI, its effects at the organizational and state level.
Consequently, for Colombia it is important to have a model oriented to
digital transformation of geographic data through ICTs. Have data
digital geographical data, enables their integration, management and efficient analysis
in the current technological ecosystem.
On the other hand, this research aims to offer a solution to the findings of the
Universidad de los Andes for the DGB in terms of uncertainty, order, completeness,
coherence, harmonization, low level of detail and accuracy through a
digital transformation that allows you to integrate, manage and make available data from
geographical type through the use of technological tools. To validate the model,
proposes its application in the geoscientific data set of the DGB of the SGC.2. Systematic Literature Review (SLR)
Considering the objectives set for this research work, this chapter
contains the Systematic Literature Review (SRL), supported by a bibliometric analysis
and in the review of previous work on the use of ICTs in the design and construction of
digital transformation models for geographic data, and their application in
organizational environments.
The SLR (Systematic Literature Review) is a means of evaluating and
interpret the research available and relevant to a topic or phenomenon of interest.
It aims to present a fair evaluation of a research topic, using
a reliable, rigorous and auditable methodology (Kitchenham & Charters, 2007).
In this research work, the literature review was carried out under the criteria
methodologies set out by Kitchenham & Charters (2007) in its most recent version;
There, three stages are established to guide the review in accordance with the objectives of
research: i) Planning, ii) Conduct and iii) Reporting and analysis of the results of
the revision.
Next, the SLR corresponding to models based on ICTs for the

2.3 Stage 3: Analysis of SLR information
Following the methodology of Kitchenham & Charters (2007), in the third phase,
analyze the results that the SLR gave for models based on ICTs, for the
geographic data digital transformation s.
▪ Bibliometric Analysis
Once the documents found in the databases have been identified, they are identified
the fields of study associated with the publications of these documents, which are
presented in the following figure: Chapter 2 39
Figure 2: Documents published by area or field of study
Note in Figure 2 that the most representative fields in this literature review
are computer sciences (43.9%), engineering (28.1%), and sciences
geospatial and planetary (21.9%), followed by decision sciences (4.4%) and fields
multidisciplinary (1.8%) with lower participation. In this analysis we took into account
the excluded fields according to the filters in the previous stage.
To identify the behavior over time of publications in this field,
presents the figure of the number of documents published per year, from 2010 to
current events:40 Development of a digital transformation model for geographic data to

2.4 Stage 4: Reporting of SLR results
Finally, after reading the documents found in the literature search
structured (indexed) and unstructured (gray literature), gives a response, supported by
this literature, to the research questions posed in the first stage:
RQ1 How has the evolution of geographic data been, from a context
digital?
The evolution of geographic data is closely related to the
evolution of GIS and digital cartography, which date back to 1967 with the creation
of the Canadian Geographical Information System (CGIS), led by Roger Tomlinson to
natural resource management (Tomlinson, 1967); since then a series have emerged
of events that have concluded in trends to use maps and geographic data to
of taking them to implementation in computer systems that can be limited up to
early 1990s, when the transfer began
from technology to the World Wide Web (Siabato, 2018). In 2004 Tim O'Reilly, whom
generally credited with being the author of the term 'Web 2.0', he stated that one of the Chapter 2 43
fundamental differences between the era of the PC and the era of Web 2.0 was the fact that
The Internet had become a platform (Gallini, 2022).
Siabato (2018) refers to a range of authors and concepts that have revolutionized the
importance of geographic-GI information such as spatial databases,
methods and models for spatial and spatio-temporal analysis, methods for
mass cartographic production, the development of advanced GIS tools for
management, consultation, analysis and visualization of geographic data, advanced techniques for
analysis of large volumes of data (geographic and spatial big-data), theories
specialized (4D moving objects), the development of technologies for the capture of large
geographic extensions such as remote sensors and more recently
autonomous (RPAS - Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems).
In that sense, Ariza & Rodríguez (2019), state in their research that today it is
necessary to conceive the productive activity of geospatial or GI data, in intimate
connection with the field of ICTs, and to do so, they consolidate the radical changes that
condition the immediate future and, in particular, aspects related to quality and
interoperability in the framework of ICTs.

The table above sets out the changes, drivers and trends in the data and GI, in
which the digital revolution is characterized by the massification of the use of the Internet and by the
deployment of broadband networks. The dimensions of digital development are in
permanent evolution, it is a synergistic process that has effects on activities at the level
of society, the productive apparatus and the State. This makes the process of
digital transformation is highly dynamic and complex. (Economic Commission for
Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC), 2021).
Mass, Rubi & Boscan (2020), point out that understanding the value of information
space at all levels: governments, private companies, non-governmental organizations
governments (NGOs, individuals, has increased considerably and that
Technological advances in spatial data management point to the continuous development of
the Spatial Data Infrastructure-IDE, which seek to develop tools and
technological platforms organized for the disposal of the GI. These systems integrate
a series of components that seek to guarantee interoperability through protocols
communication (internet), for which the OGC (OGC for its acronym Open Geospatial
Consortium) establishes quality policies and standards among web services
geographical.Chapter 2 45
From a historical perspective, Arribas-Bel & Reades (2018) describe the
behavior of geographic data science in three moments:
▪ A first wave with the arrival of computing to each organization, in the decade
from the 60s and 70s. It could be considered a first approach to the digitization of
the geographical sciences.
▪ A second wave with the arrival of computing in every office, in the 1990s.
80s and 90s, where geographical tasks began to be executed with computers,
through GIS, thus giving birth to geographical information sciences. In this space,
began to be explored with simulations, automatic models, and high-level analysis
amount of data.
▪ A third wave with the arrival of computing to every “thing”. This stage covers the
arrival of the new millennium to the present. The rise of computing and
Technology facilitated every operation in almost every aspect of life and
organizational productivity. With the arrival of industry 4.0 technologies such as
IoT and Big Data, data science is reemerging in an accelerated manner. Through
of these technological findings, research and studies begin to be conducted
towards geographic data science in the last decade, making use of new
technological trends, geolocation software, artificial intelligence and
machine learning.
RQ2: What characteristics do geographic data present?
analog/analog, which have been part of the digital transformation?
Analog geographic data has evolved and adapted to the digital age. The
transition of cartography and spatial analysis from paper work to digitalization
has given rise to the Geodigital Era (Buzai et al., 2018). Geospatial technologies, such as
GIS and Global Positioning Systems (GPS) have experienced a rapid
advance in recent decades, facilitating the analysis of geographic data in comparison
with traditional analog methods (Elwood, 2009).
The digital age has driven the development of both geographic software and hardware
and instruments for measuring, processing and analyzing geospatial data (Elwood,
2009). This has enhanced geospatial services and increased research46 Development of a digital transformation model of geographic data to
through Information and Communications Technologies (ICTs)
scientist in this field. For example, the use of drones for data collection
geographic areas and the use of specialized software have allowed detailed cartography in
complex terrain that was previously impossible to achieve with analog methods (Villarreal et
al., 2022).
Cloud computing has proven to be an effective infrastructure for the use of
computing and online storage resources, and the development of a
digital catalog of geospatial services to facilitate exchange and
interoperability of geospatial resources. (Chen et al., 2010).
The management of geographic data, especially those additional to the standards
international data, such as environmental and mobility data, has required
and specific models, such as the envVisio method, which has been used in authorities
environmental strategies for interdisciplinary cooperation, (Poßner et al.2021).
Digital transformation in geographic data science has had an impact on
various sectors, such as road infrastructure, where modeling technologies are used
in 3D for construction projects (Znobishchev & Shamraeva, 2019). Furthermore, it has
promoted citizen participation in urban planning through methods and
modern geospatial tools. (Haklay et al. 2018).
In the agricultural industry, the use of information technologies and
communication (ICT) for the accessibility of agricultural geographic information, considering
climatic, cultural, regional and technological factors (Haworth et al., 2018).
The digital transformation has also influenced the structure and articulation of the science of
geographic data with national governments. Spatial Data Infrastructures
(IDE) play a fundamental role in the digital transformation of the governments of countries.
(Barbero et al., 2019)
In summary, digital transformation has positively impacted technology and
methods of processing and representing geographic data, promoting a
greater usability of public data and the development of technical solutions to
specific problems in geographic data science.Chapter 2 47
RQ3: Where is the greatest development in transformation models?
digital and who have been its main authors? and RQ5: What are the
main fields of application of digital transformation models?
The growing diffusion of digital technologies, especially in information systems
production, is giving rise to a new industrial paradigm, usually called
Industry 4.0 (I4.0), previously mentioned (Kagermann, 2015). In the core of I4.0
is the implementation of cyber-physical systems (CPS) for industrial production, it is
that is, networks of microcomputers, sensors and actuators embedded in materials,
machines or products that are connected along the value chain (Porter &
Heppelmann, 2015), and the availability of sophisticated systems to process and analyze
Big data in real time. Simulation, augmented reality, systems integration,
cloud computing, cybersecurity and additive manufacturing are other technologies
well-known I4.0 enablers (Bellantuono et al., 2021; Lorenz et al., 2015).
All these technologies significantly expand the production possibilities and
consumption, and represent a disruptive technological change. More specifically, I4.0
generates new value propositions for highly personalized products or
differentiated, well-synchronized combinations of products and services, and
added value (Bellantuono et al., 2021). I4.0 is indeed a paradigm enabled by
technology, which is profoundly changing the way companies organize
their processes and create value for customers. Companies are becoming more aware
that digital technologies enable completely new business models and
lead to the reconfiguration of the structure of all sectors, leaving out
those companies that will not be able to adapt to change (Bellantuono et al.,
2021). Therefore, it is essential that companies innovate and rethink their business models.
business (Burmeister et al., 20 16; Ibarra et al., 2018), as well as innovate their processes and
products to take advantage of the challenges and growth opportunities generated by
new digital technologies (Bellantuono et al., 2021).
In recent years, many scholars investigated the I4.0 paradigm from different
perspectives; However, the existing literature focuses mainly on aspects
technological; less attention is devoted to management and organizational aspects
associated with digital transformation (Cimini et al., 2017). Bordeleau & Felden (2019),48 Development of a digital transformation model of geographic data to
through Information and Communications Technologies (ICTs)
For example, they argue that there are no frameworks or models that adequately support
managers and organizations in all phases of the digital transformation process and
require more structured approaches to manage the transition to the I4.0 paradigm
(Bellantuono et al., 2021).
Below is a presentation of the digital transformation models.
existing and roadmaps for the I4.0 transition consider lessons learned
In the field of change management, a well-known approach developed to
successfully manage change initiatives. With this objective, a review is carried out
systematic review of the literature to identify DTMs (DTMs)
Digital Transformation) developed to manage the transition to the I4.0 paradigm.
The results are then analyzed through the lens of change management literature.
To do this, the main change management models are reviewed and compared and
identifies the set of activities to include in any transformation initiative.
Delimiting where the greatest development in DTM is located, who have been its main
authors and what are the main fields of application of DTM.
Figure 6: Development in digital transformation models (DTM)
.Chapter 2 49
In terms of the statistics obtained on the development in Transformation models
Digital (DTM), it is observed that the area of ​​Computer Science has the highest
volume of knowledge generation with 27.9%. It is followed by the Business area,
Management and Accounting with 18.6%, and in third place are the areas of Sciences
of Decision and Engineering with 12.1% (Figure 6).
In the context of the Digital Transformation towards Industry 4.0 (I4.0), any initiative
It is considered a process of change, that is, a transition from a current state with
certain level of digitalization towards a future state with a higher level of digitalization.
Therefore, change management is adopted as a methodological approach in the article.
to analyze the DTMs proposed in the literature. Models are described and examined
known change management methods in order to identify the activities that should be
be included in any transformation initiative (Bellantuono and t al., 2021).
Since change has become inevitable in organizational life due to development
global, economic and technological (Burnes, 2004; Cummings & Worley, 2009), the
Organizations increasingly need change management skills. The management of
Change refers to a structured approach to facilitate the transition from a current state
of the organization to a desired future state (Balogun & Hailey, 2008). It involves renewing
the direction, structure and capabilities of an organization to meet the needs
changing needs of internal and external customers (Moran & Brightman, 2000).
It also refers to the process and tools used to support people in
the transition (Creasey, 2018). Next, the models of
best-known change management (Bellantuono et al., 2021).50 Development of a digital transformation model from geographic data to

Figure 7: Overview of change management models

Kurt Lewin's change management model (Figure 7) is considered the precursor of
current models. According to this "three-step" model, before making changes to a
organization, it is necessary for members to abandon their old behaviors. The
steps of the model are (Bellantuono et al., 2021):
Yo. Unfreeze: Members become aware of the need for change and
motivates those who will be affected.
ii. Change: New behaviors are introduced and changes in attitudes are developed.
organizational structures and processes.
iii. Refreeze: The organization stabilizes in a new state of equilibrium,
where new behaviors are consolidated.
On the other hand, Kotter's 8-step model of change (Figure 8) is widely
used. The steps are (Bellantuono et al., 2021): Chapter 2 51
Yo. Establish a sense of urgency.
ii. Build a powerful guiding coalition.
iii. Create a shared vision.
iv. Communicate the vision effectively.
v. Empower others to act on the vision.
saw. Plan and create short-term victories.
vii. Consolidate improvements and produce more changes.
viii. Institutionalize new approaches.
Figure 8: Kotter's 8-Step Model of Change

GE's Change Acceleration Process (CAP) (Polk, 2011; Von Der Linn, 2009) is
is based on the premise that the success of a change initiative not only depends on
high-quality technical solutions, but also to pay attention to people
affected by the change. The PAC consists of seven steps (Bellantuono et al., 2021):
Yo. Lead change: Strong and committed leadership takes charge of the initiative
exchange.
ii. Create a shared need: The reason for the change is clearly defined and
shared with all interested parties.52 Development of a digital transformation model such from geographic data to
through Information and Communications Technologies (ICTs)
iii. Shaping a vision: A clear and legitimate vision of the future is articulated after
of the change, communicating it to all interested parties.
iv. Mobilize commitment: A sense of commitment and involvement of
all people involved in the change.
v. Make the change last: Implementation begins with pilot projects, using
the successes and knowledge acquired for other initiatives and addressing the factors
that hinder change.
saw. Monitor the process: Progress is measured and problems are detected during the
implementation.
vii. Changing systems and structures: After implementation, the
organizational structure to ensure the permanence of the change.
On the other hand, Prosci's Three-Phase Change Management Process (Creasey, 2018;
Prosci, 2018) is based on the ADKAR model (Figure 9), which focuses on supporting
people through change. The process consists of three phases (Bellantuono et al., 2021):
Yo. Prepare for change: Change management plans are designed,
including awareness of the need for change, the definition of change, the
formation of a change management team, identification of a sponsor,
identifying affected groups and developing a management strategy
change.
ii. Manage change: Communication plans are developed and implemented,
training, sponsor roadmap, training and resistance management.
iii. Reinforce change: People's feedback is collected and analyzed
affected, the adoption of the change is measured, gaps are corrected and the
success.Chapter 2 53

In the systematic review process, 32 relevant contributions were identified that
address the guiding questions. Among these contributions are various
digital transformation models (DTM) proposed by different authors.
Erol et al. (2016) propose an I4.0 transformation model in three stages: "envision",
"enable" and "enact". During the "envision" stage, we seek to develop a participatory vision
of I4.0 involving stakeholders. Then, in the "enable" stage,
converts the vision into a concrete business model and develops strategies for its implementation
successful implementation. Finally, in the "enact" stage, the strategies are converted into
real projects.
On the other hand, SCHALLMO et al. (2017) develop a five-phase roadmap for the
digital transformation. These phases include digital reality, digital ambition, potential
digital, adjustment and digital implementation. Each phase addresses different related aspects
with value creation, customer requirements, best practices and integration
with partners.
In the framework proposed by Is sa et al. (2018) for the implementation of I4.0 in
manufacturing organizations, several steps are established. These include the formation of
a working group, the evaluation of digitalization, the definition of approaches, the
Use case idea generation, impact estimation, and case selection
of use according to the level of maturity of the organization.54 Development of a digital transformation model of geographic data to
through Information and Communications Technologies (ICTs)
Romero et al. (2019) present a Lean Digital Transformation Framework that combines
“Lean” practices and tools in five management pillars. This approach includes management
digital strategy, which involves defining a long-term digital vision, evaluating the maturity
digital and select appropriate technologies and work methods.
Le Grand & Deneckere (2019) propose an agile change management model that consists
of three phases: definition, experimentation and anchoring. In the definition phase, a
diagnosis; in the experimentation phase, workshop and control cycles are carried out; and in
the anchoring phase, an overview of completed and future projects is provided,
along with an analysis of the capacity for change.
Ng et al. (2018) define a conceptual model for the systematic development of planning plans.
digitalization action in companies. This model includes stages such as the evaluation of the
current business model, the design of the digital business model, the evaluation of the
current digital capabilities, the identification of future digital capabilities and the
development of the action plan.
Rautenbach et al. (2019) propose a conceptual model of digital transformation in two
phases: evaluation of the current value creation process and internal and external evaluation
of the organization. These assessments lead to the creation of job creation profiles.
value and digital profiles, which guide the organization in creating value by taking advantage
the digital dimension.
Pessl et al. (2017) propose a model to evaluate the digital maturity of companies and
develop an action plan. Its focus is on bridging the gap between the state
current and objective state of digital transformation. This idea is directly related
with the methodological framework proposed by Leone & Barni (2020), who suggest supporting
SMEs in their digital transformation by identifying innovation gaps and converting them
in I4.0 integration projects. Its approach seeks to help companies with resources
limited to achieving a successful transformation.
On the other hand, Butt (2020) proposes a framework based on the Business Process tradition
Management (BPM) to optimize business processes during transformation
digital. Their focus is on redesigning processes to adapt to the digital age.
This idea is also related to the conceptual framework presented by Van Tonder et al.Chapter 2 55
(2020), who es highlight the importance of innovation in the business model during
the digital transformation. Both approaches seek to ensure that the processes and model
business are aligned with the organization's digital objectives.
Regarding the integration of social technologies and IoT, Mendhurwar & Mishra (2021)
highlight its importance in digital transformation, but also point out the challenges of
associated security and privacy. This idea coincides with the proposal of Nikitin &
Kulchytskyy (2021), who propose a digital transformation management model
based on the strategic relationship between government, society, companies and
software developers. Both approaches consider the ethical and
security as key elements during the digital transformation process.
Finally, Ou et al. (2021) present a specific decision-making framework for the
digital transformation in the retail industry. Its focus is on identifying
business problems, set goals and execute a transformation plan. This idea
highlights the importance of strategic planning and proper execution during the
digital transformation process.
In general, these theories and approaches converge on the importance of evaluating maturity
digital, identify gaps, redesign processes, innovate in the business model and
consider ethical and security aspects during digital transformation. I also know
highlights the need for strategic planning and collaboration between different
actors to achieve a successful transformation. These main ideas provide a
solid foundation to address the challenges and take advantage of the opportunities that arise in the
context of digital transformation in companies.
This research was based on the partial application of the Digital Transformation Framework
for the Colombian State, designed by the MinTIC. This Framework is based on the
compliance with article 147 of Law 1955 of 2019 – National Development Plan, the
which establishes that the TD component must be incorporated into the action plans of
state entities. To this end, gather the necessary elements to enable and
leverage the use of emerging technologies, through process modification,
products or services, in such a way that they support the generation of public value. To do this,56 Development of a digital transformation model of geographic data to

In this way, the questions RQ3 are answered: Where is the greatest development located?
in digital transformation models and who have been their main authors? and RQ5:
What are the main fields of application of transformation models
digital? And additionally, the references or the construct for modeling the
digital transformation reference framework object of this document, Figure 10.
Figure 10: Construct for TD framework design
RQ4: What are the most used ICT components in the
digital transformation models?
As has been mentioned throughout the conceptual framework, the motivation to
implementing digital transformation models in organizations is to facilitate the64 Development of a digital transformation model from geographic data to
through Information and Communications Technologies (ICTs)
enabling your capabilities to leverage your digital transformation through
reinvention or modification of its processes, products or services, ensuring the
value generation (MinTIC, 2020c). For this purpose, ICTs are made available that
They facilitate overcoming technological, organizational, and infrastructure gaps.
From the MinTIC, frameworks and models of digital transformation are proposed for
public and private organizations in the country; Regarding digital technologies, they propose
an ICT prioritization scheme based on organizational objectives. This can
detailed in the following figure:
Figure 11: Strategic priority of ICTs in the adoption of TD Models
Source: taken from (MinTIC, 2020c)
Note that a large part of the ICTs listed in Figure 11 obey to characteristics
of Industry 4.0 and technologies based on artificial intelligence, cloud computing
and the Internet of Things. cab and note that implementation times are relative
and suggested for a Colombian context, however, this really varies depending on the type
the organisation.
Similarly, the Ministry of Information Technology and Communications
(MinTIC) has proposed a guide of guidelines for the acquisition and use of technologiesChapter 2 65
emerging in public and private entities with service provision characteristics
(MinTIC, 2019). According to the MinTIC, emerging technologies refer to new
technologies that are under development or will be developed in the next five to ten years
and that will substantially alter the business and social environment (MinTIC, 2019).
In the current context of technological boom and the arrival of Industry 4.0, technologies
known as emerging ICTs, are emerging rapidly. Is
It is important to note that emerging technologies are not necessarily new, but
which can also be implemented in a particular context and represent a
novelty (MinTIC, 2019).
The guide proposed by the MinTIC consists of four stages with several steps in each of them.
them (MinTIC, 2019). These stages are the following:
Yo. Understand and create strategies:
to. Develop ICT implementation strategies based on objectives
Of the entity.
b. Identify possible applications of ICTs.
c. Verify the feasibility of the implementation.
ii. Design:
to. Establish prerequisites and evaluate the current state of the Entity.
b. Develop a pilot test.
iii. Enable:
to. Enable the necessary capabilities in relation to the structure
organizational.
b. Establish a governance model that allows maintaining and improving the
ICTs.
iv. Implement and Sustain:
to. Implement changes at the institutional level.
b. Train and develop internal talent in the new environment of the Entity.
In the Colombian sphere, the ICT sector refers to the digitalization of the state and the
adoption of production processes that comply with the most technological standards
advanced (MinTIC, 2020a). According to the MinTIC, this sector promotes programs and66 Development of a digital transformation model of geographic data to
through Information and Communications Technologies (ICTs)
projects that strengthen digital citizen skills and establish alliances
public-private that generate development for the country (MinTIC, 2020a).
After the COVID-19 contingency, the technology and communications sector
is in a reactivation process, demonstrating the importance of a digital system
modern that covers the entire national territory (Business Intelligence Headquarters -
External Intelligence Coordination, 2021). Currently, the sector focuses on three
project approaches to continue with the modernization of the country (Intelligence Headquarters
of Business - External Intelligence Coordination, 2021). These approaches are:
Yo. Digital transformation: Promote the intensive use of and ICTs in processes
productive, electronic commerce, MSMEs and their value chain, with the
objective of increasing productivity and competitiveness in global markets.
ii. Programmer training: Given the demand for specialized professionals
in emerging ICTs, it is necessary to promote training and training in
programming and associated technologies, to ensure a qualified workforce
and competitive.
iii. Connectivity: Expand fiber optic coverage to connect more municipalities
throughout the country, thus guaranteeing adequate infrastructure that allows the
access to digital services.
It is essential that the ICT sector is informed about policies and programs
of the country, such as the National Development Plan and the initiatives of the MinTIC, to take
informed decisions that benefit companies and citizens in general
(MinTIC, 2020a). Government initiatives, such as Transformation Centers
Digital, have generated significant advances in business development and the adoption of
emerging technologies (MinTIC, 2020a).
Furthermore, it is relevant to mention success stories in the implementation of ICTs at the level
international, which include current trends in ICTs aligned with the Industry
4.0, such as cyber-physical systems, Internet of Things, Big Data, artificial intelligence, among
others (MinTIC, 2019). The successful implementation of these technologies has demonstrated theChapter 2 67
importance of having digital transformation models that support managers
in the implementation and development of dynamic capabilities (MinTIC, 2019).
In the context of Industry 4.0, digital transformation in the manufacturing industry
involves complex changes that require reformulating business models and adapting
new approaches to digital transformation (MinTIC, 2019). For this, six are proposed
Design principles for digital transformation in the manufacturing industry:
interoperability, virtualization, local talent, real-time talent, decentralization and
customer orientation (MinTIC, 2019). These principles help guide implementation
successful digital transformation in this key sector of the economy.
Although the Colombian MinTIC itself recommends strategies for the adoption of
digital transformation and the integration of emerging technologies into processes
organizational, there are also cases of success in the implementation of ICTs at the level
international, whose main findings are documented below:
According to Becerra (2020), the main current trends in ICTs aligned with the
industry 4.0, are systems development, the Internet of Things, the Internet of Things
people and services, additive manufacturing, 3D printing, reverse engineering, Big data and
analytics, artificial intelligence, unmanned vehicles, 5G, cybersecurity, among others. In
the framework of digital transformation, the implementation of these ICTs favor the
digitization of industrial systems and processes, as well as their interconnection through the
IoT, Big Data, Cloud Computing and Cybersecurity, along with others
specific to the context such as wireless sensors, augmented reality, robotics, and
devices framed in smart environments (Becerra, 2020).
Generally, when considering TD in an organization, managers understand the
concept and approaches, but they are not always clear how to implement it; here it is
where TD models come in to provide support to managers, through methods,
tools, and technologies, that promote and facilitate transformation (Bordeleau &
Felden, 2019). Some authors suggest that the development of dynamic capabilities
could serve as the basis for a successful transformation, similarly, Bordeleau &
Felden (2019) suggest that both structured TD methods and the development of
digital and office capabilities are necessary, but flexibility is required in the68 Development of a digital transformation model of geographic data to
through Information and Communications Technologies (ICTs)
approach to change management and knowledge management due to the uncertainty of the
environment in Industry 4.0.
With the advance of Industry 4.0, ICTs began to have a strong impact on the
manufacturing industry, digital transformation through emerging technologies
was beginning to be a priority in companies producing goods; The transformation
It is not only digital, but also social, since it involves measures of change of
paradigm and knowledge transfer (Oztemel & Gursev, 2020). For the industry
traditional manufacturing, these changes are usually quite complex, for which
They need to reformulate business models and adapt new transformation models
digital oriented to each case. After a rigorous systematic literature review, Oztemel
& Gursev (2020) define six design principles for TD in the manufacturing industry:
Interoperability, virtualization, local talent, real-time talent,
service orientation and modularity.
Within the framework of I4.0, Oztemel & Gursev (2020) describe some of the approaches that
would facilitate digital transformation in organizations, of which the following stand out:
cyber physical systems, IoT, cloud computing, smart factories,
smart cities, digital manufacturing, augmented reality and simulation, mining
data, and robotics. Alcácer & Cruz-Machado (2019) add Big Data to this list, the
cybersecurity, and additive manufacturing, emphasizing the importance of
cyber physical systems and the IoT for smart factories, as well as the Internet of Things
services, such as key technologies for organizations.
Now, TD and ICTs always go hand in hand towards development
organizational, both for private entities as well as public entities. Literature
reports various findings in the use of ICTs within the digital transformation framework
for state, government, and public sector entities. An example of this are
the guides developed by MinTIC (2019, 2020a, 2020b) that seek to bring entities closer
publics towards digital transformation through maturity and TD models. In addition,
Gomez et al. (2018) study the behavior of ICTs in public entities
Colombians, identifying technological, strategic, and character gaps
administrative that entities present when addressing emerging technologies in their
entities.Chapter 2 69
Bula Páez et al. (2022) recommends working on better articulation of entities
governments in charge of meeting the digital transformation goals,
since it is observed that some indicators agreed in plans, programs and initiatives
Colombians have not reached their goal due to the lack of joint work between the
parts.
Following this thread, the TD with a municipal administration focus seeks to advance in
technological gaps and the development of companies, citizens and other groups of
the city that actively participate in the TD. In this order of ideas, cities
Intelligent technologies require not only ICTs, but also digital transformation models that
facilitate the adoption of these technologies; It is important to study the opportunities of
technology and data for each geographic, productive, economic and sociocultural context
of the countries, that is: their market, economy, services, production, innovation,
migration, resilience, infrastructure, interactions, among others, and involve the
citizenship within the challenges towards the smart city (Hamamurad et al., 2022). Low
the broad framework that is smart cities, the most considered technologies are
grouped into two groups:
▪ ICTs: That seek to guarantee connectivity to the new digital world in a way
quickly and safely, in a collaborative way and that involves the community. Accompanied
of sensors that detect changes in the environment, favoring traceability,
prevention of adversity, and resilience. Fields also fall into this group
of study such as GIS, trend analysis, and collaborative work
(Hamamurad et al., 2022).
▪ Data Processing: Most of the data processing technologies fall into this group.
industry 4.0 that facilitate the collection, processing and analysis of data; as,
for example, IoT, Big Data and Cloud Computing. Within this field
Research into new technologies is also evaluated, such as new
materials, robotics, new construction methods, 3D printing, among others,
that promote the development of smart cities (Hamamurad et al., 2022).
Smart cities also involve transportation management and tools
IT for solving traffic problems co in megacities; currently,70 Development of a digital transformation model of geographic data to
through Information and Communications Technologies (ICTs)
Geographic data, digital cartography, and GIS are some of the most
used if we hope to achieve a smart city (Chehri et al., 2022).
Yamamoto (2020) presents a very particular case of application of ICTs in the framework of
geographic data science, since it uses ICTs as an infrastructure tool
digital to prevent disasters and formulate contingency strategies in Japan; the authors
propose a GIS social network mechanism, which involves communication services
social network, the social network Twitter, and Web-GIS, available in Japan, thus creating a
collaborative tool with a strong social impact and innovative content. This is a
example of how to relate ICTs with geographic data science within the framework of
digital transformation for the benefit of the community.
To conclude this section, it is highlighted that the implementation of ICTs has left a series
of challenges in education and the step towards a digital transformation, since they have changed
the traditional form of learning to one based on digital (Becerra, 2020), which
requires the coordination of each role within an organization, from management
strategic to the operational level.
According to the findings found in the literature, it can be seen that most
of studies on the implementation of GIS and geographic data in TD contexts
focus on improving transportation, routing, cartography, and
road infrastructure (González-Jaramillo, 2015; Haklay et al., 2018; Prah & Štrubelj, 2018;
Yamamoto, 2020), whose ultimate goal is to promote development towards a smart city
through ICTs (Chehri et al., 2022; Daniel & Doran, 2013; Hamamurad et al., 2022),
that are supported by I4.0 technologies to guarantee digital transformation, from
the operational activities of each industry to government coordination and
citizen participation.3. Theoretical framework
This chapter aims to bring the reader closer to a conceptual approach and contextualization
to the concepts and notions that will be worked on throughout the document, as well as the
most notable generalities in these fields. To search for information in this
section, structured (indexed) and unstructured (also
known as “gray literature”), which theoretically define the concepts to be treated and
They provide information on the current context of these fields.
3.1 Geographic data science
In the field of science there are multiple branches of knowledge that, as it is in this
case, they are usually intertwined to share and create new knowledge. Arribas-Bel &
Reades (2018) point out that computer and information sciences have been
intertwined with geographical sciences s, which gave way to a new field that
called Geographic Data Science, in which pollination could occur
crusade for the benefit of both Geography and the data community in general. TO
From this new branch, a whole series of conceptual approaches adapted
to modern times and digitalization.
3.2 Geographic data
Geographic data, also known as spatial data, describes the location
and attributes of objects on Earth. They can be classified into absolute, defined location
by coordinates, and relative location, based on topological relationships. The data
Geographic areas are commonly represented in the form of maps and are georeferenced in
terrestrial coordinate systems, associated with a spatial reference frame. For
obtain information and perform analysis, adequate data processing is required,
which may include statistical analysis and geometric features. In addition, 72 Development of a digital transformation model of geographic data can be
through Information and Communications Technologies (ICTs)
combine both perspectives to achieve a complete spatial analysis. Morea Rodriguez
& Huerta Rodríguez, 2018; Villarreal et al., 2022; Madrid Soto & Ortiz López 2005).
3.3 Geographic Information Systems (GIS)
Geographic Information Systems (GIS) are computer systems that capture,
They store and display data related to the location on the planet's surface.
These systems allow us to understand spatial relationships, preserve data and perform
analysis combining them with graphical and mapping interfaces. GIS includes both
hardware as software and can use cartographic, photographic, digital and
spreadsheets. (National Geographic Society, 2022; (Morea Rodríguez & Huerta
Rodríguez, 2018).
The combination of knowledge presented in "Geographic Information System and
Science" by Longley et al. (2015) and "Multicriteria Decision Analysis in Geographic
Information Science" by Malczewski & Rinner (2015) provides a comprehensive view of the
application of GIS in geographic data science. On the one hand, Longley and Goodchild
They cover the fundamentals and general applications of GIS, such as capture,
storage and analysis of geographic data, as well as the use of technologies and
advanced GIS techniques. Additionally, they explore the relationship between GIS and disciplines such as
cartography, remote sensing and spatial analysis, while Malczewski and Rinner
They focus on multi-criteria decision analysis within the context of GIS. Are
Combined perspectives offer a solid foundation for understanding and addressing problems
complexes in spatial decision making (Longley et al., 2015; Malczewski & Rinner,
2015)
3.4 Digital focus on geographic data
Traditionally, cartographic information is presented in analog form, that is,
representing the reality of ma physical nature and continues, however, with the advance
technological, it becomes necessary to adapt this information to digital format in a way
discreetly, that is, analytically (Morea Rodríguez & Huerta Rodríguez, 2018). For
obtain a digital cartography, it is necessary to continue with two fundamental requirements: Chapter 3 73
▪ Digital data must be georeferenced, in such a way that each data
geographical location has a label that defines its spatial position in a
reference.
▪ The spatial characteristics of the geographic data must be described in terms
digital through topological relationships.
Additionally, it is important to encode geographic data using a
geocoding, which according to Morea Rodríguez & Huerta Rodríguez (2018), can be
direct or indirect:
▪ Direct Geocoding: It consists of determining the absolute spatial location
for each geographic data in a system of orthogonal coordinate axes. The
The most used systems are those of plane coordinates for spaces on the
Earth's surface in a Cartesian plane with two perpendicular axes (X, Y).
▪ Indirect Geocoding: It consists of the possibility of geographically locating
elements from the values ​​of an attribute of an entity, such as the address,
the postal code, the municipality, among others. This geocoding has a huge
spectrum of demographic analysis on cartography and data science
geographical.
3.5 Digital Transformation (DT)
3.5.1 Delimitation
Digital transformation is an evolutionary process that goes beyond the adoption of
technologies, affecting all aspects of an organization (Rodríguez-Abitia &
Bribiesca-Correa, 2021). There are different interpretations of this concept: some see it
as an incremental application of information technologies (Heilig et al., 2017a),
while others consider it a disruptive change driven by innovations
cumulative digital data (Skog et al., 2018; Rodríguez-Abitia & Bribiesca-Correa, 2021).
Digital transformation involves changes in processes, organization, commercial domain and
society (Parviainen et al., 2017a). It also requires multidimensional approaches, such as
the development of digital capabilities (Gurbaxani & Dunkle, 2019) and considerations74 Development of a digital transformation model from geographic data to
through Information and Communications Technologies (ICTs)
specific to the industry and the size of the organization (Demlehner & Laumer, 2020).
To be successful, it is important to address aspects such as organizational culture,
collaboration, digital leadership and workforce capabilities (Muehlburger et al.,
2019).
Digital transformation seeks to improve organizational performance through
simplification of processes, the creation of new services and the innovation of products and
services (Westerman et al., 2014). In addition, it can generate benefits such as improving
the quality of the customer services and obtaining competitive advantages (Davenport,
2013; Fitzgerald et al., 2014; Rajabi & Bolhari, 2015; Sahu et al., 2018; Westerman &
Bonnet, 2015).
In conclusion, digital transformation involves profound changes in an organization and
its environment, and requires a clear strategic vision and the integration of digital capabilities
to make the most of the opportunities of the digital age.
Figure 12 illustrates the TD area (upper left quadrant). The two axes show
the operational processes of an organization. The vertical axis presents value creation
and provision of services and the horizontal axis, the services or products offered by the company.
The focus is on the transition from conventional to innovative business models.

The key factors for digital transformation projects were described by
Sandkuhl et al., 2019 and are: strategy, leadership, products, people, culture,
operations, governance and technology.
3.5.2 Digitalization is not digital transformation (TD)
Digitizing involves converting analog information into digital format, such as scanning
documents or use electronic forms (Reis et al., 2018a). On the other hand, the
Digitalization uses digital technology to create value in new ways, improving the
operational efficiency and reducing errors (Gobble, 2018). Examples of digitization
can be the coordinate records in Excel tables and the collection of
coordinates through geospatial readers (Gobble, 2018; Hsu et al., 2018). Without
However, digitizing does not imply changes in the process itself, nor does it promote new models,
that is part of digitalization (Hsu et al., 2018). In short, digitizing converts
analog information into digital, while digitalization takes advantage of technology
digital to generate value.
Digitizing involves implementing registration systems and, increasingly,
commitment. On the other hand, digitalization involves taking advantage of data and processes
digitized to generate knowledge and take action (Manyika et al., 2016). The
Digitalization lays the foundations for digital transformation, which implies a
Complete reconstruction of the business around the opportunities and demands it offers
digital technology (Gobble, 2018). According to Jeanne Ross, digitalization is a necessity
operational, while digitization or "going digital" requires a value proposition
visionary that has the potential to redefine a business and even an industry (Ross,
2017).(Figure 13).76 Development of a digital transformation model of geographic data to

3.5.3 Impacts of the transformation digital mation (TD)
Digital transformation is changing the way organizations work and their
organizational environment. Ignoring this process can pose a risk in markets
highly competitive. Digital transformation has an impact on both aspects
internal operations of an organization as well as in the creation of new opportunities
commercial processes and the restructuring of roles in the value chain. For example, you can
eliminate traditional intermediaries and give rise to new intermediaries through the
direct access to consumers and the use of mobile devices (Parviainen et al., 2017).
Digital transformation can be approached from three perspectives: internal efficiency,
external opportunities and disruptive change. In terms of internal efficiency, the
Digitalization improves internal processes through digital means, resulting in
greater efficiency, quality and consistency. It also provides better vision in
real time of the operation and the results by integrating structured and unstructured data
structured, allowing a more complete understanding of the data of the
organization and integration of information from other sources (Parviainen et al., 2017).
Figure 14: Impacts of digital transformation
Source: Adapted from (Parviainen et al., 2017)
Digital transformation has a significant impact on organizations by improving the
internal efficiency, offer external business opportunities and bring about change
disruptive in the operating environment. This is achieved by automating work
routine, improving customer service and creating new business models.78 Development of a digital transformation model from geographic data to
through Information and Communications Technologies (ICTs)
Additionally, the COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the adoption of digital transformation,
and companies with a high level of digital maturity have obtained competitive advantages. The
Digital maturity is assessed through characteristics such as access, automation,
customer orientation, efficiency, flexibility, innovation, operational effectiveness,
vision and quality (Parviainen et al., 2017; Performance Improvement Partners, 2021; von
Solms, 2021; Kohlegger et al., 2009) Figure 14.
3.5.4 Digital transformation – maturity and maturity models
There is a need to adopt a different approach towards Industry 4.0 and transformation
digital, considering various levels of maturity. A gradual approach is proposed based
in the implementation of Industry 4.0 technologies and methodologies, as well as changes
organizational tools to advance from one level of maturity to the next (Issa et al., 2018).
Maturity is represented through a matrix that shows the potential development of
an organization in sequential periods. Nolan's model (Nolan, 1979) was the
precursor of maturity in information systems, followed by Capability Maturity
Model ( CMM) (Paulk et al., 1993), used to evaluate the development of
software and related areas. It is assumed that the organization's performance is
related to their level of maturity (Issa et al., 2018).
A Maturity Model (MM) is a valuable technique for measuring different aspects of a
process or organization, providing a measure for auditing, evaluation
benchmarking, evaluating progress and understanding strengths, weaknesses and
opportunities (Proença & Borbinha, 2016).
Maturity is defined as a process to define, manage, measure and control the
evolutionary growth of an Entity, where the objective is to reach a state in which the
organization is capable of achieving its objectives. Maturity involves advancing from a state
initial to a more advanced final state (Fitterer & Rohner, 2010; Mettler, 2009; Sen et al.,
2012).
Mature organizations measure different indicators compared to less mature ones.
mature, and maturity is related to evolutionary progress toward an ability or goalChapter 3 79
specific (Amaral & Araújo, 2008; Cooke-Davies & Arzymanow, 2003; Koshgoftar &
Osman, 2009).
Figure 15 shows that the maturity models represent sequential levels that
form an anticipated logical path from an initial state to a final state of
maturity, evaluating progress in relation to defined levels (Kohlegger et al.,
2009; Proença & Borbinha, 2016; Röglinger & Pöppelbuß, 2011).
Digital transformation involves changing workflows and processes through
digital technologies, while digital maturity is the understanding and ability to
implement those changes. Both are interrelated and affect operations
commercial and efficiency. Lack of understanding of digital maturity can
hamper digital transformation, and the lack of a digital maturity model makes it difficult
evaluation of critical areas for change (Antonizzi & Smuts, 2020; Del Pozo &
Crab, 2018; Liu et al., 2022).
A Digital Maturity Model (DMM) or Digital Transformation Maturity Model
(MMTD) is a framework that assesses a company's current level of digital maturity and
provides a roadmap to achieve digital maturity goals (Brown &
Brown, 2019; Liu et al., 2022).
There are generic and industry-specific MMDs, which offer information based on
data on current levels of digital maturity and apply to different aspects of the
business (Butt, 2020; Performance Improvement Partners, 2021; Sandkuhl et al., 2019).80 Development of a digital transformation model from geographic data to
through Information and Communications Technologies (ICTs)

3.5.5 Dimensions of Digital Transformation
Digital transformation requires extensive reinvention that encompasses considerations
strategic, technological, human capital and d e organizational culture (Gill &
VanBoskirk, 2016; Wulf et al., 2017). Competitive advantage now comes from ideas that
become new businesses and innovative business models, better products
and services, and greater productivity and efficiency, through software coding and
taking advantage of digital platforms.
At the same time, physical assets that used to confer competitive advantage are becoming
commoditizing, especially with the rise of global supply chains
(Gurbaxani & Dunkle, 2019). This has led to a crucial change in the source of advantage
competitive towards software. Creating value through software requires vision
and a redefined strategy, alignment between commercial and digital strategies,
codification of intellectual property and valuable knowledge, a culture of innovation,
technical talent and digital technology capabilities (Gurbaxani & Dunkle, 2019).
Table 3-1 summarizes the research of Gurbaxani & Dunkle (2019), which identified six
key business dimensions for a successful digital transformation that positions
a company in a competitive position:
• Strategic vision: includes the existence of a strategic vision for the world
digital and a strategy to execute it, as well as the capacity of the executive team
to lead digital transformation.Chapter 3 81
• Innovation culture: refers to management practices that encourage innovation,
such as compensation metrics, tolerance for failure, and culture assessment
organizational.
• Know-how and intellectual property (IP) assets: the amount of
knowledge and IP assets that the company possesses and how it leverages them in
terms of operations, customer understanding and product development.
• Digital capabilities (talent): the talent available in the company is considered
to support digital transformation, both at a strategic and technical level.
• Strategic alignment: refers to the company's ability to carry out
financial investments that support your strategic vision, including the
willingness to cannibalize existing revenue streams and businesses in the short term.
• Technological assets: the level of use of emerging digital technologies is evaluated,
such as Big Data, data analytics, mobile technologies, cloud computing and
Internet and wireless communications.
These dimensions are fundamental to position a company in a position
competitive in the digital era (Heilig et al., 2017b; Liu et al., 2022; Reis et al., 2018; Teichert,
2019).

3.5.6 Information and Communications Technologies (ICTs)
3.5.6.1 Relevance of ICTs in the Industry 4.0 paradigm
The term ICTs is defined in a broad sense as technologies dedicated to
storage, processing and communication of information (Rao, 2004). According to
Martyn et al. (2003) ICT constitute a range of technologies, applications and Chapter 3 83
software, hardware, telecommunications and information management devices that are
used to create, produce, analyze, process, package, di distribute, recover,
store and transform information. Therefore, ICTs are communication networks
organized and data resources that collect, transform and disseminate information within
and between organizations (Seyal et al., 2000; Sharma and Bhagwat, 2006). The adoption of the
ICTs provide many benefits in a wide range of transactions and processes.
commercial within and between companies. The adoption of ICTs improves the management of
information and knowledge within the company and can reduce costs of
transaction and increase the speed and reliability of transactions for both business
to business (B2B) and from business to consumer (B2C) (Ongori & Migiro, 2010). Besides,
are effective tools to improve external communications and the quality of the
services for new and established clients (OECD, 2019a).
Although the fourth industrial revolution has not yet taken place, various
technologies that will drive its development. According to the literature reviewed, Figure 16
provides a summary of the technologies considered fundamental (Wichmann et al.,
2019). Of the 17 technologies mentioned, 15 share similar characteristics.
Although they are classified as industrial technologies, their objective is not to affect cells
individual production processes in processes such as machining, joining or forming. In
Instead, they focus on collecting, interconnecting and managing factory data with the
in order to optimize and streamline the production sequence (Schmidt et al., 2015). Besides the
robotics and additive manufacturing, the other technologies use information as a
resource in the value creation chain (Wichmann et al., 2019).84 Development of a digital transformation model from geographic data to
through Information and Communications Technologies (ICTs)
Figure 16: Key technologies fundamental to industry 4.0
Source: Adapted from: Wichmann et al. (2019)
The predominant technologies in the fourth industrial revolution belong to the field of
ICT. These technologies allow interoperability and comprehensive communication of the
production systems in the factory. Since they function as media,
they are unlikely to be implemented individually (Wichmann et al., 2019).
Within these technologies, the Cyber-Physical System (CPS) is considered especially
instrumental for Industry 4.0, since the main mentions in the literature have
synonymous features and functionalities that cannot be separated from each other.
(Wichmann et al., 2019).
An industrial revolution drives the paradigm of best practices in manufacturing
and enables previously unattainable levels of productivity. The industry is expected to
4.0 follow this pattern (Schmidt et al., 2015). Both academics and manufacturers
have high expectations for this evolving paradigm as it is anticipated to create
extraordinary opportunities to increase r income and/or productivity (Liao et al.,
2017).
Figure 17 highlights the most common benefit propositions that are predicted to be
characteristics of future manufacturing. These emerging features areChapter 3 85
closely related to the search for Industry 4.0 and the benefits of
next industrial revolution (Wichmann et al., 2019).
Figure 17: Proposed benefits of Industry 4.0
Source: Adapted from Wichmann et al. (2019)
Despite the anticipated benefits, there are still considerable challenges to overcome to
that I4.0 is successfully realized in the industry. Figure 18 summarizes what the literature
revised considers central challenges that still require research and development by
part of the academy. Shows strong consensus that there is a need for guidance
in implementation and questions about how to manage the expected increase in
system complexity (Wichmann et al., 2019).
Figure 18:Industry 4.0 implementation challenges
Source: Adapted from Wichmann et al. (2019)86 Development of a digital transformation model of geographic data to
through Information and Communications Technologies (ICTs)
The literature shows that the biggest driver of unresolved complexity is connection
network of a heterogeneous factory so that all production systems can
connect and communicate autonomously (Li et al., 2017; Lin et al., 2022). Does not exist
a standardized solution that facilitates the networking of interfaces and protocols
provider-specific communication (Wan et al., 2016). Figure 18 illustrates that there are
efforts to standardize networking methods; However, standardization
is slow and individual providers are unlikely to wait and therefore
lose market opportunities (Weyer et al., 2015). Research to develop
A successful CPS must continue to search for a robust method that allows all
production systems connect to the network, communicate their status and react to the
updated information (Lu, 2017).
3.5.6.2 Digital Divide Index in Colombia
The Digital Divide Index in Colombia is a tool that evaluates the digital divide
in the country on a scale from 0 to 1, where values ​​closer to zero indicate less
digital divide. This index is made up of four dimensions that influence the
formation of the gap and its participation is reflected in a full stacked bar. He
The main objective of this index is to strengthen territorial capacities to monitor
and monitor the digital divide. Furthermore, it allows comparisons to be made at the level of
departments in terms of motivation, material access, mastery of skills
digital and use of technologies (MinTIC, 2022).
Figure 19: Results of the national total Digital Gap Index from 2018 to 2021
Source: Taken from MinTIC (2022) Chapter 3 87
In 2021, Colombia's Digital Divide Index stood at 0.4107. This indicates a
difference of 0.1561 compared to the best score obtained by Bogotá D.C.
(0.2546) and a difference of 0.3425 compared to the worst score recorded in
Vichada (0.7532). Regarding the weight of each dimension in the digital divide at the level
nationally, it is observed that Digital Skills represent 35.1%, followed by
Material Access with 31.7%, Achievement with 29.9% and Motivation with
3.3% (Figure 19), (MinTIC, 2022).4. Digital data transformation model
Geo-TD
Considering the objectives of this research and the referential scaffolding contemplated
In chapters 2 and 3, this section supports the construction of the model designed for the
digital transformation of geographic data and validated in the Cartography and
Geological and Geomorphological Research of the SGC.
Figure 20: Digital transformation model of geographic data Geo-TDChapter 4 89
4.1 Characterization of the process
In 2020, the MinTIC presented the Framework document for Digital Transformation, the
What is the guide to enable capabilities in public entities in order to leverage
digital transformation and the use of emerging technologies, through reinvention or
modification of processes, products or services that ensure the generation of value
public (MinTIC, 2020b). In that sense, Geo-TD adopted the tools developed
to carry out the diagnosis and identification of the areas and processes that manage data
geographical and that are suitable for proposing digital transformation initiatives.

The MinTIC has a digital maturity measurement tool on its web platform and
prioritization of initiatives for digital transformation in public entities (Figure 21).
The first objective of this tool is to assess the digital divide through
four-segment rating (Figure 22):
Yo. People and Digital Culture
ii. Digital Processes
iii. Digital Data and Data Analytics
iv. Digital Technology90 Development of a digital transformation model of geographic data to

Under the methodology established in the MinTIC Framework document, Figure 23 relates
the processes addressed for the characterization of this model.
The first step is based on the understanding of the concepts, elements, technologies and
processes that frame the route towards Digital Transformation and in the formation of the
equipment according to the needs in the identified process.Chapter 4 91
Figure 23: Segment or 1 of the process for the characterization of the process to intervene
The second step is the understanding of the four dimensions established in the

▪ People and digital culture: the level of digitalization of people is analyzed
who perform the main group processes and the management of hard skills
(operational/technological) and soft (behaviors/culture towards change)
(MinTIC, 2020b).
▪ Digital processes: focuses on analyzing the existing digital divide within the
key processes of the group, in order to achieve the ideal state for each of
them (MinTIC, 2020b).
▪ Digital data and analytics: the main enabler for decision making at
strategic level of the group is the use of “Data Driven Decisions”
based on data), which are characterized by grouping robust databases
to make accurate and effective decisions (MinTIC, 2020b).
▪ Technology: is based on analyzing current and emerging technologies that
The group has to optimize the main processes (MinTIC, 2020b).

Step four consists of calculating and evaluating the results obtained in the Model of
Maturity, there it is necessary to evaluate what will be the dimensions that will demand efforts and
digital transformation initiatives Figure 25.
Step five of the process for characterizing the process in Figure 23 consists of
the application of Instrument No. 2 (Annex B) to the leader or coordinator of the group or
organization, in order to identify the phases, functional areas, key processes that
They use geographic data. Likewise, know the interactions, inputs and products of
each.
The above can be developed through interviews, questionnaires, meetings and/or
workshops with the members of each functional area.94 Development of a digital transformation model of geographic data to
through Information and Communications Technologies (ICTs)
To identify and prioritize processes and functional areas that require intervention
In terms of digital transformation, each area leader or coordinator must consider rar the
steps suggested in the Digital Transformation Framework document for entities
public information from the MinTIC (2020b) and mentioned below:
Yo. Incorporate the group's key processes in the X Axis
ii. Define and add the functional areas of the group on the Y Axis
iii. Identify the points of digital vacuum in the interaction between the X and Y Axes, through
of the evaluation of the relationship between each area and process, if it does not exist or does not apply
its value must be zero (0).
iv. Evaluate on a scale from 0 to 9 taking into account 3 prioritization factors:
▪ Feasibility/viability of implementing 4.0 technology, does the technology exist
for interaction? Is there a will to digitally transform the area
functional or process?
▪ Potential that implementing 4.0 technology would have, in terms of improving the
indicators of the process or functional area.
▪ Existing urgency to achieve the objective of digital transformation in the
interaction.

Step six contains the Heat Map, the prioritization of initiatives is calculated with the
values ​​defined in the matrix presented in Figure 26 and in the Tool for the
Digital Transformation of Public Entities of the MinTIC.
The results of the Heat Map allow us to identify which processes and areas are

Figure 27: Segment 2 of the process for the characterization of the process to intervene
Step seven is based on knowing all the processes and their interactions in order to
to distinguish the phase and instance in which it is located within the group or organization.
Step eight presents the details of the prioritized processes and their location within the
general diagram. Likewise, the geographical data that
intervene in the flow, in order to propose within the technological platform the
elements and components necessary to guarantee quality validation rules
in accordance with the data model established in the requirements sessions.
Step nine is framed in the delimitation of the technical needs of the process and
its integration with the ICT concepts and technologies available in the group or organization.
This step must contain between the team aware of the business rules and the team
of IT.96 Development of a model for digital transformation of geographic data to

4.2.1.1 User needs
The importance of the end user as someone who knows the rules must be understood.
business of the organization. The type of work sessions, language used between the
technical group and the end user must be appropriate, in order to achieve an understanding
mutual, ambiguities must be avoided as much as possible when identifying the need
of the user by the analyst. It is recommended that work records be generated with
commitments, results of the session, date and participants. The above in order to
generate traceability on the identified requirements and as support to identify
responsible for points of contention (components that do not meet the expectations of the
user).
4.2.1.2 Constraints of existing technological ecosystems
A review of existing systems must be done at the level of software components
and hardware in such a way that the tool to be developed is compatible with them.
4.2.2 Planning
Once the requirements gathering stage is completed, a schedule is built to
based on the estimate of resources required by each functionality according to the complexity
that you have, it is recommended to use a difficulty assignment according to the Fibonacci scale,
This difficulty assignment task can be somewhat subjective, since it depends on
many times the skill or expertise of the developer. It is advisable to rely on Chapter 4 97
tools such as the Gantt chart to identify the project's critical path, milestones and
tasks that can be performed in parallel.
4.2.3 Design
Once the characterization of the process has been carried out and the needs and
appropriate technologies for the development of the tool, training sessions must be held

For this research work, the model developed by the MinTIC is adopted.
called Technological Solutions Architecture Guide applicable to entities
Public (MinTIC, 2019). As a contribution to this research, within the framework of development
of a model, emphasis is placed on flows involving spatial data.
This methodology starts from the general to the specific, within the regulatory framework of the Open
Group, here an architecture is defined as a structure that contains components and
their interrelationships. This section proposes the development of the architectures
reference and solution, within the framework of a digital transformation process, since these
They are transversal to the axes addressed, data, people, processes and technologies.
The reference architecture is defined as a high-level design, it has no details
referring to technologies or products, commonly It is used as a template for
development of other architectures that involve a higher level of detail. His main
characteristic is that it includes the design principles that govern the organization. This
process produces an agnostic template transparent to implementation technologies
and deployment, likewise, presents a logical grouping at the level of service areas
(MinTIC, 2019).
The solution architecture represents a materialization of a solution architecture.
reference, that is, it includes specific technical components involved in the
architecture, as well as the interaction of these (communication channels and protocols).
This architecture details at a technical level the components involved in the
configuration of a solution, represents the scenario in which these components98 Development of a digital transformation model of geographic data to
through Information and Communications Technologies (ICTs)
interact with each other, respecting the guidelines and governance rules documented in
the reference architecture.
Figure 28: Overview of the enterprise architecture and its domains
Source: Taken from (MinTIC, 2019)
The main advantage of developing a solution architecture is that it seeks to solve the
problem of integrating a new component in a harmonious way, with the assets
existing technological resources of the organization, additionally, it must adhere to some guidelines
technicians that ultimately obey the needs of the business and add value
strategic to the Entity.
Having a solution architecture also addresses data components,
integration protocols, execution environments and service areas, requirements not
functional, high availability schemes, among other aspects (MinTIC, 2019).
4.2.4 Development
This stage includes the creation of repositories and the construction of the code for the
needs defined in the design.
4.2.5 Deployment
In this instance, the application must be deployed. That is, install and
configure the software on a server or in a production environment. The end userChapter 4 99
performs the system test in order to verify correct operation through the
use of geographic data that is part of the prioritized processes.
4.2.6 Validation
An acceptance test must be carried out to evaluate from the point of view of the
user, if the technological platform meets the requirements and expectations raised
from prioritizing processes to intervene.
4.3 Implementation of the Transformation Model
Digital geographic data
Once the validation test of the technological platform is completed, the
implementation of Geo-TD in the group or organization. For this it is necessary to carry out
a communication, socialization and dissemination plan to the people involved in the
processes involved in TD.
It is necessary to carry out testing and adaptation workshops of the model proposed, taking into account
Keep in mind that the process change must be done gradually, that is, maintain the
traditional model and the new one. Workshops and technical support must be carried out
before, during and after each field day. They must be committed by functional area
and evaluate the results for the prioritized processes.
The transition can begin with a sample of geographic data that is meaningful and
making backup copies of the new data, until 100% of the data is available.

This chapter presents the validation and relevance of the Digital Transformation Model,
called Geo-TD and developed for this research.
5.1 Case study
The SGC manages the study of geosciences to contribute to the achievement of the National Plan of
Development and seeks to satisfy the socioeconomic needs of the country, for the year
One of its functions is the DGB in its structure, through which plans are proposed,
programs and projects in regional basic geoscientific research. Under this
approach, the generation of geological cartography has become the basis of
knowledge and characterization of the evolution, composition and processes that
determine the current morphology, structure and dynamics of the Colombian subsoil (SGC,
2022).
The case study selected in this research to validate the Model of
Digital Transformation for geographic data is the Cartography and Research Group
Geological and Geomorphological of the DGB of the SGC. Which is being implemented
geoinformation technologies that allow for the appropriate transition of processes
analog to digital, facilitating the capture, acquisition, management, analysis, interpretation,
representation, storage and dissemination of geological and geomorphological information of
efficiently and in accordance with GI quality standards (SGC, 2022)
The missionary objective of the group selected for the case study is: “Develop the
plans, programs and projects related to structural geological knowledge and
tectonic structure of the Earth's crust, useful for the evaluation of geological threats and the
exploration of subsoil resources, according to standards and policies
institutional” (SGC, 2022). Chapter 5 101
Within the initiatives of the Cartography and Geological Research Group and
Geomorphological, is the design and implementation of the Hall of
Geomatics, which presents a technological and modern perspective to provide
strategies, methods and instruments that allow obtaining high levels of disaggregation
of geoscientific information and enhance the processes in the generation and analysis of
geological cartography maps at appropriate scales and their integration into web platforms
geographical (SGC, 2022).
The selection tion of the case study was based on the need to structure and arrange
digitally the GI produced by professionals in the field days and which
They are the main basis for the generation of cartographic products in the Entity. The group
of Cartography and Geological and Geomorphological Research presents a large number of
historical geographic data in analog format and constantly generates new
geoscientific information, which requires being part of a transformation process

The next step consisted of applying Instrument No. 2 (Annex B) to the coordinator
of the Cartography and Geological and Geomorphological Research group, in order to
Identify the phases of each project and the functional areas for each one.
Next, a workshop was held with the members in the areas described, in order to
disaggregate and understand each of the processes, generate the integrated flow diagram
and determine direct area/process relationships.
To identify and prioritize processes and functional areas that require intervention
Regarding digital transformation, workshops were held with the leaders of each area and
the steps suggested in the Framework for Digital Transformation document were considered
for public entities of the MinTIC (2020b) and mentioned below:
Yo. The key processes of the group were incorporated into the X Axis
ii. In the Y Axis, the functional areas of the group were defined and added.
iii. Digital vacuum points were identified in the interaction between the X and Y axes. E yes
That is, for interactions that do not present a direct relationship or do not apply, the value
was zero (0) (gray color)
iv. The other interactions were analyzed and evaluated on a scale from 0 to 9 to
through the weighting of 3 prioritization factors:
▪ Feasibility/viability of implementing 4.0 technology, does the technology exist
for interaction? Is there a will to digitally transform the area
functional or process?
▪ Potential that implementing 4.0 technology would have, in terms of improving the
indicators of the process or functional area.104 Development of a digital transformation model of geographic data to

The postfield phase corresponds to processing, structuring, loading, generation
of products, analysis and interpretation based on the information collected in the
field. This phase is divided into four processes: information processing
polygonal and drone flights, structuring, loading and storage of information
geoscientific data collected in the field, laboratory analysis of the samples and finally
the generation of geological and geomorphological cartography (Figure 35 and Table 5-3).108 Development of a digital transformation model of geographic data to
through Information and Communications Technologies (ICTs)
The organization, uploading and storage of geoscientific information collected in
field begins with the digitization of the physical notebook of each professional in two
tools, the index book and the digital notebook. In these two files both the
general data of each station, structural data and sample (location, coordinates,
plate, among others), as well as the specific data of each data (number of samples and
structural data taken by station, type of structural data, the structural data,
characteristics of the sample, type of analysis to be performed, among others).
Additionally, each professional must submit a photographic record, an annex
photographic and a commission report. Once all the information collected is delivered
in the field following the parameters described Itos, a technical validation is carried out where
checks the correct organization of the information collected, following the parameters of
officialization of the SGC.
Once the validation of the information collected is completed, the
storage of this in the institutional repository and uploading it to the Database
NON-RELATIONAL Geographic following the officialization standards of the SGC. This
Database corresponds to the main input for consulting field information.
For the laboratory analysis process, the samples area is responsible for assigning the
IGM, prepare the samples and send them to the respective laboratories. Subsequently
receive the analyzes carried out on each sample for evaluation, analysis and integration
in geological cartography.
Finally, all the information collected in the field and stored in the
institutional repository and in the GDB, as well as the products from the polygonal and
drone flights, to generate the geological and geomorphological cartography of the project.
In conclusion, the methods and technologies currently used to structure, validate
and integrating field data require additional standardization processes and the
use of various software, in addition, the information rests in multiple files located
in mapped network storage drive folders.Chapter 5 109

It is important to mention note that the objective of this file is to have a digital copy of the
field notebook, therefore, there will be as many Excel files as there are notebooks used
for each professional. In that sense, depending on the needs of each project,
You can have an average of 150 digital notebooks per project/year. For this
research used 100 digital data notebooks

▪ Geographic Database (GDB)
The SGC standard GDB is the spatial representation of the index book, it contains as many
layers (feature class) as sheets in the Excel file, these layers are not found
standardized and are not structured in a relational model, which makes management difficult
of data and execution of queries without having to do spatial operations in a
CHALK. The data model is found in Annex D.

5.2.2 Preliminary result of the process diagnosis
prioritized
▪ There is no GDB that centralizes the data, we work with independent files
in local storage, in the best of cases the GDBs are located
stored on network drives, but without documentation, versioning or
change control.
▪ Excel documents are used for records, coordinates in most
of the cases are transcribed.
▪ There are no rules for quality, integrity and completeness of data in the records of
Excel, in some cases domains are managed.
▪ One of the most serious problems of the process is in the marking of samples,
since the identifier or registry key is dynamic and depends on the application
of business rules of various actors.
▪ The generation of new products is costly since it is required to validate
in several data sources possible updates due to not being available in one
single centralized data source.
▪ There is no data governance.
5.3 Technological platform1
Based on the results of the characterization stage through the partial adoption of the
Framework for Digital Transformation for public entities of the MinTIC, the
construction of a technological platform as a tool for consultation, registration and
management of geological data taken in the field. The above in order to:
Yo. Standardize the codes associated with records and samples.
ii. Generation consultations and specialized reports.
iii. Have an information system that centralizes field data.
iv. Provide a visualization mechanism for geographic data that integrates the
elements necessary for the construction of the required spatial context.
1 This technological tool was developed by the author within the framework of her work commitment
with the SGC, therefore, the rights to the technological tool belong to the Entity.Chapter 5 113
Annex E: Technology Platform Interfaces presents some screenshots
of the Technological Platform developed and validated in the case study group.
5.3.1 Gathering of requirements
In order to know first-hand the expectations and requests of users of the
technological platform, workshops and interviews were held with the coordinator, technical leaders
and staff from the Cartography and geological and geomorphological research group of the DGB.
The requirements were based mainly on the analysis of the problem, documentation
existing, and based on the information collected from the joint sessions,
the functional, non-functional requirements and actors of the technological platform.
▪ Previous considerations:
In this case study, field work is required where the resources of
connectivity and computing are limited, in the best of cases a
smartphone or a laptop.
The work areas have low or no coverage of mobile data networks, since the
Work will be carried out in rural areas of Colombia, areas of interest that
They are usually located far from populated centers.
In response to this need, it is validated that the technological platform will have to incorporate
the mechanisms necessary to have a device that can function in
offline way. This device will be able to host the data on a storage unit
local until they can be sent to the component that collects and centralizes all the data
submitted by users.
There are users who prefer to record the data they take in the field in a physical book,
called field notebook.
Consequently, the platform must have a mechanism that incorporates a keyboard
mechanism that allows for the transcription of this data quickly, the
applications that can be run on a laptop or workstation of either type 114 Development of a digital transformation model of geographic data to
through Information and Communications Technologies (ICTs)
web or standalone are emerging as alternative solutions to the need. Hereby
Mass loading can also be carried out, that is, results from many stations or
samples. The upload forms must be friendly, with help elements and that
incorporate validation rules, such as length, types, drop-down lists or
domains.
For users who have validation and int functions Data egration will be allowed
access to data through an information system that allows the management of
data with geographic component. This may be a system developed by third parties and
that can be connected to the technological solution to be developed.

Within the framework of the objectives of this research, we proceeded to identify the elements
of the technological platform ecosystem and its implementation through the
conceptual and functional components based on ICTs, for digital transformation
of the geographic data of the case study.122 Development of a digital transformation model of geographic data to

Figure 42: Interfaces of the technological platform
In that sense, the architecture proposed for the case study is service-oriented.
It presents three identified interfaces: i) Web App, ii) GIS Desktop and iii) Mobile App, a
through which users will be able to access the services (Figure 42).
Figure 43 presents the four layers (elements) that interact to provide the
services prioritized in the technological platform, and Figure 44 shows the communication
between them.

5.3.3.2 Solution architecture
Considering the characterization of the process, the workshops carried out with the IT group,
coordinator, area leaders and the development group, the layers and their
technological components in terms of necessary protocols, services and interfaces
for the solution architecture (Figure 45).
The architecture adopts the hybrid cloud model, making use of available resources
in the Entity's Datacenter the services acquired in the Esri ecosystem.
Some of the services deployed will be accessed from the internet, intranet or some other
tunnel over the internet (VPN) that provides additional security elements.124 Development of a digital transformation model of geographic data to
through Information and Communications Technologies (ICTs)
Figure 45: Conceptual model of the solution architecture
The technological tool adopts elements of an architecture based on
microservices, there is a logical separation between the Backend, Frontend, and
DataBase-DB. The above allows us to have a solution that is easy to maintain and
operation. Being implemented on this paradigm, it incorporates advantages such as
horizontal scalability, easy migration and deployment, is agnostic to the operating system of the
server since it operates on Docker technology.
The application makes use of the http protocol to expose its services to users and others
systems (this is the case of the Esri ecosystem and for the use of Google OAuth 2.0), through
of using WLAN/LAN networks. To provide security over the traffic that goes out to the Internet,
They implement SSL certificates.
Due to organizational policies, these types of applications cannot be exposed in
internet, therefore, for those users who wish to enter and are not in
The Entity's facilities may do so from a VPN tunnel. The tool
technological will be deployed on an OnPremise server provisioned by the group
IT of the Entity. Chapter 5 125

5.3.4 Implementation of technological platform
This section presents the development and implementation of the technological platform as
support element for the execution of prioritized and identified processes, Chapter 5 127
through the application of the Digital Transformation Framework for public entities
(MinTIC, 2020b).
▪ Technical scope: Through the technological platform the user can carry out
the tasks prioritized in the characterization.
▪ Thematic scope: The technological platform allows professionals in the
Cartography and Geological and Geomorphological Research group register the
geographic data obtained in the field in a centralized GBD to facilitate the
structuring, validation, management and i process integration of information
geological stations, structural data, samples collected in the field,
laboratory analysis results and basic and thematic cartography layers.
5.3.5 Methodology
For the development of this technological platform, the methodology proposed by
Sandoval & Vargas (2019), applying a process composed of four phases that are
described below.
▪ Planning phase
The requirements of the technological platform, its structure, components are identified.
and relationships (Sandoval & Vargas, 2019).
▪ Design phase
The design phase includes the creation of the physical architecture of the platform
technological, taking into account the analysis of users, requirements and standards and
design strategies (Sandoval & Vargas, 2019).
▪ Development phase
In this phase it is decided to adopt the SCRUM and Mockup-Driven development methodologies.
Development (hereinafter MDD) (Figure 48).128 Development of a digital transformation model of geographic data to
through Information and Communications Technologies (ICTs)
Figure 48: SCRUM and MDD development methodology
The SCRUM methodology is widely adopted for the development of
software because it is an agile methodology and easy to adopt.
From the sessions carried out with the case study group, the
ease of using graphic elements as a common language among the development team
and business experts, which is why the MDD methodology is also adopted.
SCRUM begins with the construction of the Product Backlog, which is a prioritized list,
from the value delivered to the client, from all the characteristics that the
Technological platform.
Figure 49: Relational model of the SCRUM methodologyChapter 5 129
The solution is built iteratively in Sprints, there a number is assigned
determined number of Product Items to each developer, which have a coefficient of
difficulty, in order to make an adequate distribution of workloads and have a
accurate time estimate.
- Data model
To simplify the visualization and prioritize entities that have significance and
relevance, this document omits entities for internal use for the Web Application,
such as parametric tables, tables with SQL statements, styles, among others. It is used
of EER modeling (EER for its acronym Entity-Entity-Relationship).
The EER model is used to design a relational database schema, which is
based on the relationship between entities and the relationships between them (Figure 50).130 Development of a digital transformation model of geographic data to

This chapter consists of three sections, the first presents the results of the
research regarding the achievement of the proposed objectives and research questions
formulated, the second presents the general conclusions and the third describes the
proposed points to expand the research in future work.
6.1 Research results
6.1.1 Objectives
Prepare the diagnosis of the current technological state of the digital transformation of
the data from the Cartography and Geological and Geomorphological Research Group of the
Colombian Geological Service (SGC), to identify the challenges in the
digitization of geographic data.
This objective was met through the characterization of the process, through the review
of literature and the partial application of the Digital Transformation Framework for entities
public of the MinTIC (2020). For this exercise, the available tools were used
to measure the Digital Maturity Level and identify and prioritize through the Heat Map,
the processes that demand intervention in terms of Digital Transformation. No
However, this was an approximation of the current technological state and had to be complemented
with the evaluation and disaggregation of the processes. Section 4.1 frames the process to
performed within the model and section 5.2 details the result of the objective through the
GeoTD validation.
This research involved an intervention for geographical data, therefore,
It was necessary to review in detail the key processes of the case study group through Chapter 6 145
work sessions with the different functional areas of the group, in order to know the
dynamics of processes, inputs and products.
Identify the conceptual and functional components based on ICTs, for the
digital transformation of geographic data.
The fulfillment of this objective is achieved through three instances, the first addressed the
conceptual review of ICTs and the exploration of previous application works
documented in chapter 2, the second instance involved the identification of the
problems in the prioritized processes in the characterization and the third instance
included the selection of appropriate methods and technologies to solve the problems
issues.
It should be noted that the conceptual and functional components based on ICTs
selected in this research are detailed in section 4.2.2, however, also
They are listed in sections 2.1.5, 2.2.3 and 3.2.
To validate the model in this research, the following concepts were used
ICTs: Cloud computing, Geolocation, Microservices, Edge computing.
However, the projects derived from this research, especially for the case
study can be framed in the use of Machine Learning and Big Data.
Design the digital transformation model for geographic data.
The design and construction of the digital transformation model for geographic data Geo-
TD, was based on the dimensions proposed by the MinTIC in the Transformation Framework
Digital for public entities, it is a model oriented to the user and internal processes
and intermediate organizations.
Geo-TD seeks to enable processes that use geographic data to evolve
transversally in terms of: i) People and digital culture ii) Digital data and Analytics, iii)
Digital processes and iv). Technology, providing the tools to groups and
organizations to build solutions based on ICTs.146 Development of a digital transformation model of geographic data to
through Information and Communications Technologies (ICTs)
Likewise, it contemplates the MinTIC architecture metamodel, which guides the
selection and definition of technological components for the design and construction of the
platform. The design, characterization and construction of Geo-TD is detailed in Chapter
4.
Validate the proposed model for the digital transformation of geographic data.
Use case: Cartography and Geological and Geomorphological Research Group of the
Colombian Geological Service (SGC).
This objective was met through the application of Geo-TD in the Cartography Group and
Geological and Geomorphological Research of the Colombian Geological Service (SGC). This
case study was selected because it brings together potential scenarios for the
model validation. Additionally, because one belongs to the group and knows the
missionality and data used in the group.
In addition to the objectives and in order to support the validation of the model, it was developed and
implemented a web-oriented technological platform, which works under an engine
relational database, with an architecture based on microservices, uses
http protocol to expose services to Esri and Google users and systems
through the use of WLAN/LAN networks and implements internet security certificates
SSL.
In that sense, this research presents the fulfillment of the 4 stated objectives.
The code repository and associated documentation of the technological platform of
Geo-TD validation can be consulted in the Azure link enabled for this purpose.
6.1.2 Research question
What methodological and conceptual elements can be incorporated into a model to
enhance the digital maturity of organizations that generate and use information
geographical in their missionary processes?
Within the framework of digital transformation and considering the SLR, there are various
instruments aimed at enhancing digital maturity at the organizational level, however, Chapter 6 147
Models like Geo-TD bring together and specify the necessary instruments and tools
to enhance the digital maturity of organizations that generate and use data
geographical.
In that sense and in the first instance, the characterization and calculation tools of the
level of digital maturity are a valuable instrument to diagnose the technological state
current and guide ICT application initiatives. In the second instance, the
implementation of technological platforms and solutions based on ICT concepts,
They concentrate instruments that enhance missional processes in organizations.
This research describes in greater detail in chapters 4 and 5, the instruments
designed and implemented to validate the Geo-TD model in the case study
selected.
6.2 Conclusions
▪ This research constitutes a contribution from Geomatics to organizations
public and private that involve geographic data in their processes, and lack
of elements to undertake digital transformation initiatives in different
scenarios and levels.
▪ Geo-TD allows you to consult historical works without wasting effort and resources,
eliminates the use of email or instant messaging systems with
attached files, strengthens certainty in decision making and adjustments or
Corrections are reflected with greater immediacy.
▪ Geo-TD reduces execution time in prioritized processes, since it has
information in services for consultation, management, analysis and generation of
geological and geomorphological products.
▪ ICTs have become a fundamental element for the transformation
digitalization of processes in organizations, however, this entails guiding
efforts to increase investments in technology and highly human talent
trained, who can take on the challenges of digital transformation.
▪ Centralizing geographic data in a single system avoids duplication of
records and allows better use of ICT resources. Besides. the settings or
Corrections are reflected with greater immediacy.
▪ Geo-TD represents an alternative solution appropriate to the needs of the
case study, since it eliminates neck bottles, use of files148 Development of a digital transformation model of geographic data to

decentralized, incorporates elements of geographic data quality through
forms with validation in fields and eliminates the transcription of coordinates.
▪ Know first-hand the needs of the actors, including accompanying
field days to understand the scenarios, should be fundamental in a
correct gathering of requirements for the development of a system of
information that responds to the needs and expectations of the organization, which
which avoids resistance in its adoption.
▪ Digital Transformation Models should not focus solely on the
adoption of technologies to achieve changes in their processes, there must be a
organizational culture that fosters, encourages and adopts changes at the level
technological.
▪ Technology must be understood as an enhancer of processes and not as
a threat, public servants must be allies of these initiatives and
changes and not become an obstacle to its adoption.
▪ Digital transformation must be a state policy and not a government policy, which
suggests a continuity of the processes and efforts made despite the
ideological and political changes that arise.
6.3 Future work
▪ It is necessary to introduce validations from quality metrics based on standards
ISO 9126 – 19157 that evaluate the technological platform and the quality of the GI.
▪ The functionalities that provide support must be incorporated into the technological platform.
to processes not attended to and that have appeared in the list of processes
prioritized in the Heat Matrix.
▪ Incorporate Machine Learning and Big Data capabilities on the data
geographical data collected represents an interesting work challenge, since the
Initiatives of this nature have been unsuccessful due to the non-existence of a
single digital data source containing all historical records of
stations and samples.
▪ It is important to develop your own mobile App that incorporates functions
specialized in the area of ​​cartography, QR scanning for samples, functions
advanced methods of using a compass and adding watermarks to images. Annex A: Question form for

Digital capabilities as the basis of digital transformation. A
proposal for the National University of Colombia Manizales Campus
Description: Digital transformation is a challenge that all organizations face
in a world where technology is constantly evolving. The National Government of
Colombia has established a Digital Transformation and Artificial Intelligence policy
approved in November 2019 where it specifies that one of the limitations has to do with
with digital capabilities to incorporate changes. From the institutional vision of
“inno vación con conciencia social”, la Universidad Nacional de Colombia se convierte en
la primera institución pública de educación superior del país comprometida con la
transformación digital, incorporándola a nivel nacional en el Plan Global de Desarrollo
(PGD) 2019-2021 y a nivel de Sede en el Plan de Acción 2019-2021 como eje principal.
En lo local, para dar inicio a este proceso se requiere conocer la situación actual de la
sede. Este trabajo final de tesis se enfoca en incorporar modelos de capacidad digital
reconocidos a nivel internacional en los procesos de transformación digital de la UN Sede
Manizales. Para el desarrollo del trabajo se sigue una metodología mixta que es la
integración sistemática de los métodos cuantitativo y cualitativo con un enfoque
metodológico no-experimental de tipo exploratorio que combina también aspectos
descriptivos. Se realiza un diagnóstico de capacidades digitales en la Sede Manizales
donde se determina el nivel de competencia de estudiantes, docentes y administrativos, a
partir de estos resultados se propone una hoja de ruta y un plan de capacitación como
punto de partida para las estrategias del proyecto Transformación Digital UN 2030.

Abstract
Capabilities for digital transformation. A proposal for the National University
of Colombia, Headquarters Manizales
Description: Digital transformation is a challenge faced by all organizations where
technology is constantly evolving. The National Government of Colombia has established
a Digital Transformation and Artificial Intelligence policy approved in November 2019 where
it specifies that one of the limitations has to do with the digital capabilities to incorporate the
changes. Since the institution's vision "innovation with social awareness", the National
University of Colombia becomes the first public institution of higher education in the country
committed to digital transformation, incorporating it at the national level in the Global
Development Plan (PGD) 2019- 2021 and at the Headquarters level in the 2019-2021
Action Plan as the main axis. At the local level, to start this process it is necessary to know
the current situation of the headquarters. This final thesis project focuses on incorporating
internationally recognized models of digital capability in the digital transformation processes
of UN Manizales. For the development of the project, a mixed methodology is followed,
which includes the systematic integration of quantitative and qualitative methods with a
non-experimental exploratory methodological approach that also combines descriptive
aspects. A diagnosis of digital capabilities is carried out at the Manizales Headquarters
where the level of competence of students, teachers and administrators is determined,
based on these results a roadmap and a training plan are proposed as a starting point for
the strategies of the project UN 2030 Digital Tra nsformation.

There are studies focused on models or frameworks of digital capabilities at the level
international that have been developed with the purpose of providing tools that
allow us to evaluate the state of the organizations.
The government of Colombia has identified the importance of this transformation, therefore
For this reason, in its Global Development Plan 2018-2022 it formulates the National Policy of
Digital Transformation and Artificial Intelligence which seeks to boost productivity and
promote the well-being of citizens, as well as generate transversal enablers
for sectoral digital transformation, so that Colombia can take advantage of the
opportunities and address the challenges related to 4IR. This policy is limited
to be surpassed by promoting in citizens the necessary knowledge and skills
to face the changes in the economic and social structures that the 4IR brings, hence

digital transformation in the University it is necessary to evaluate current capabilities, as well
as the obstacles or difficulties that could prevent the achievement of the transformation. TO
As a result of this institutional policy, the Manizales Headquarters in its 2019-2021 Action Plan
contemplates the project Transformation of the Organization which aims to know the
current situation of the Headquarters and one of the main themes is digital transformation.
This is how the present study arises, due to the need for the Headquarters to know the
capacity current conditions to begin the digital transformation process where
identifies that it is essential to integrate digital capabilities. Consequently, this
work focuses on incorporating digital capability models recognized at the level
international in the digital transformation processes of the UN Headquarters Manizales. For your
development, a mixed methodology is followed, which is the systematic integration of methods
quantitative and qualitative with a non-experimental methodological approach of an exploratory type
which also combines descriptive aspects and what is intended is i) to determine the
existing best practices to evaluate digital capabilities in educational institutions

1. Chapter 1 Study design
The future of governments, companies and society in the fourth industrial revolution
(4IR) driven by information and communication technologies (ICT) will depend
of their ability to adopt digital technologies (World Economic Forum, 2016).
According to Klaush Schwab, founder of the World Economic Forum, it is the combination of
digital, physical and biological systems for the transformation of humanity. In the
digital and intelligent era, ICT is increasingly recognized as a tool for
facilitate socioeconomic transformation and inclusive growth. (World Economic
Forum, 2016).
New technologies are generating innovation and creating new jobs. Further
Half of all new jobs in the United States are now in “new jobs.”
professions” that did not exist a few years ago. In the last decade, four out of ten
Jobs were created in highly digital-intensive sectors (OECD, 2019). Without
However, this transformation presents challenges, according to (Fierro Santillán, 2017) indicate
that as this stage progresses, the consequences in all areas of life
will change, they propose that in the short term there will be changes in employment proposals and that
according to a study carried out by Carlos Toxtli, entrepreneur and researcher from West Virginia
University, 45% of positions will be replaced by technology which will produce a
progressive unemployment.
In this sense, the 4IR produces transformations in relation to its speed, scope and
impact that it can produce in an organization in which many areas will have to
change and rethink, which is why it is necessary to transform to survive in this
digital transformation is oriented towards this new environment.
Duparc (2013) states that true digital transformation is achieved when the entire
organization assumes the importance of a digital culture and makes it its own at all levels.4
It is not a problem of technology but of people and organizational structures adopting
a new management model (Arango Serna, Branch, Castro Benavides, & Burgos, 2019).
While (Westerman, 2014) asks the question if digital transformation is the solution
to emerging business challenges in the digital age or whether it is another buzzword of
marketing, however or comes to the conclusion that digital transformation is the use of
digital technologies to improve the performance and reach of organizations.
These new changes that have come with the 4IR industrial revolution and the transformation
digital, also affect higher education institutions – IES- so they will have
the challenge of promoting learning opportunities that allow inclusion in this new
digital era, likewise, they will have to rethink the way their processes operate
internally, so that it can coexist in a balanced way with technologies
oriented to ICT, virtual reality, artificial intelligence, robotics, systems
experts, augmented reality, big data, cloud computing, the internet of things, as well
such as those related to emotional intelligence, coaching, mindfulness
conscious) without forgetting the organizational culture through continuous collaboration
(Fierro Santillán, 2017).
The importance of ICT skills and digitalization in HEIs has been growing in
In recent years, there are studies focused on digital transformation models and
digital capabilities with the purpose of providing tools to evaluate the state in
where the institutions are located. Almaraz Menéndez (2016) provides a framework of
reference that breaks down the digital transformation process in Universities and is
applied at the University of Salamanca. Likewise, M. Kozina & V. Kirinić (2018) carry out
a measurement of digital capabilities in IES in 2018 using a model of
digital capability maturity and the results of the evaluation were applied in a
IES. On the other hand, international standards such as ISTE, 2017, Redecker, 2017 and OECD,
2015 recognize the need to equip all citizens with the skills
necessary to use digital technologies critically and creatively (Bond, Marín,
Dolch, Bedenlier, & Zawacki-Richter, 2018).5
Governments, including the Colombian government, are responding to opportunities and
challenges posed by the 4IR with policies and strategies that address transformation
digital. In Colombia, the pace of transformation has been slow compared to the rest of the country.
world, as evidenced by the loss of positions in international indicators
such as the Electronic Government Development Index (from 31st place in 2010 to 61st in
2018) and the Digital Competitiveness Index (from 49th in 2014 to 58th in 2019), therefore,
the Government of Colombia in its Global Development Plan 2018-2022 Pact for Colombia,
Pact for Equity formulates the National Digital Transformation and Intelligence Policy
Artificial which seeks to boost productivity and promote the well-being of citizens,
as well as generate the transversal enablers for the sectoral digital transformation, of
so that Colombia can take advantage of the opportunities and face the challenges
related to 4IR. The former public policy ist until now speaks of three limitations
to be overcome:
(i) Digital transformation policies have been more oriented to
Government in order to make the citizen-State relationship more efficient, not
However, although there is progress in the matter, it is necessary to accelerate the
step to be at the forefront of the most recent developments in the
digital government field; (ii) given the speed of technological change that
is experienced, the country still must encourage citizens to
knowledge and digital skills necessary to face the
changes in economic and social structures brought about by the 4IR; (iii) the
competitiveness and productivity policies have incorporated technologies
digital, although not with the relevance and depth that the
4RI.(National Department of Planning DNP, 2019, p. 18-19).
The National University of Colombia – UN, being a state entity, accepts the
policies proposed by the National Government and considers as the main pillar within
its Institutional Strategic Project for the Global Development Plan (PGD) 2019-2021,
“digital transformation” to create a culture that transforms learning and goes from
hand in hand with new technologies (National University of Colombia, 2019), the vision
of this pillar is until the year 2030; The general objective is to promote in the University a
community tuned to innovation, through a digital transformation, where the6
advancement of technology and emerging trends maximize collaboration,
active learning, research and creation (Arango Serna et al., 2019) indicate that
To begin the transformation process in the University, it is necessary to evaluate the
current capabilities, as well as obstacles or difficulties that could prevent achievement
of the transformation.
At the Manizales Headquarters, before the Higher University Council on December 3, 2019, the
Headquarters Management Team proposes the Action Plan called Program 3 + 2, to
through which, in one of the chapters, he exposes the current situation and the diagnosis of the
headquarters and include the projection of the organizational structure where they show “a certain
difficulty in the development of administrative processes that link several
dependencies. This aspect affects the organizational climate and does not allow the University
be more agile and efficient” (National University of Colombia, 2019, p. 32).
“As an alternative solution to this condition, various possibilities arise to rethink
the University, considering as a management principle of best practices, seeking
maintain a competitive advantage” (National University of Colombia, 2019, p. 32). The
Headquarters directives view digital transformation as an opportunity for

change, and “aims as a fundamental element to establish the current state of the
organization, as well as the way how the people involved interact
development of university work” (National University of Colombia, 2019, p. 32).
According to what is established in the various studies consulted and public policy
existing in Colombia which mentions the limitations to be overcome (in the case of
This study is limitation ii) which relates to promoting knowledge and skills
digital citizenship (National Planning Department DNP, 2019), as well as,
the need for the University to know the current capabilities to begin the
digital transformation process at the UN and the need for the headquarters to know the status
current situation in relation to digital transformation, it is identified that it is essential to incorporate
that digital transformation digital capabilities.7
In this sense, the following question arises: How to incorporate capacity models
internationally recognized in the digital transformation processes of the
National University of Colombia Manizales Campus?
Likewise, the following questions arise:
• How to determine existing best practices for assessing capabilities
digital in an HEI?
• How to identify the level of advancement of digital capabilities at UN Headquarters
Manizales?
• How to establish the lines of action of the digital transformation for the UN Headquarters
Manizales from the current state of its digital capabilities?
1.1 Justification
According to what was stated in the situation found, the directives of the Manizales Headquarters
have raised in their action plan for 2019-2021 the issue of digital transformation for

the current state of the organization, as well as the way people interact

It is a standard to be met by state entities, coupled with the need for the UN in

This project will be a tool for decision making at Headquarters and a step towards
compliance with the digital transformation and artificial intelligence policy proposed by
the National Government.
1.2 Theoretical framework and related works
The world has had to live various transformations related to industry and
technology. In each one, changes were made in the energy sources, processes and
industrial activities, the means of communication and transportation which has allowed
great social transformations.
The first industrial revolution can be traced back to 1760 with the invention of the
railway and the invention of the steam engine and marked the beginning of production
mechanics. The second industrial revolution began in the mid-19th century.
characterized by the mechanical and metallurgical industry and made mass production possible,
fostered by the advent of electricity and the assembly line. Third
Industrial revolution began in the 1960s, it is known as the digital revolution
or the computer, because it was catalyzed by personal computing (1970s and 1980s)
and the internet (1990s) (Schwab, 2016). And the Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR) begins
starting in the 20th century characterized by the massive adoption of digital technologies such as
internet, smart mobile phones along with the growth of computing and
Storage capacity.
According to Gonz (2017), there are three transformations derived from the combination of the
technological advances: first, consumer behavior; second the irruption of
technology characterized by the exploitation of data, artificial intelligence and
development of new infrastructure; and the third the emergence of new models of
business that arise from the digital world.
The digital transformation has generated interest in research, academia and
business. Some authors who have been interested in the subject have their own concept, such as9
As can be seen in Table 1, which lists various definitions of
digital transformation compiled by the authors Morakanyane, Grace & O’Reilly (2018).

1.2.1 Digital transformation in Education Institutions
Superior
Given the importance of digital transformation in higher education institutions,
Below is a literature review on digital transformation in
Higher Education Institutions – IES- in order to know the level of maturity in the
which institutions are on this issue.
International Context
At the University of Oldenburg in Germany they carried out a study where they interviewed
200 students and 381 teachers in order to know the perception of the students and
teachers about the use of digital media, the findings indicated that both students
as teachers they use a limited number of digital technology for activities
related to the assimilation of learning and suggest supporting the broad use of
technology for teaching and learning purposes (Bond et al., 2018). On the other hand, in a
report carried out in 2018 by the digital education organization of the Kingdom
Kingdom, through which more than 22,000 students from 74 organizations were surveyed
of the United Kingdom and 10 international organizations, it was concluded that "the
Full benefits of technology to support learning have not yet been realized,
and technology is more commonly used for convenience than for teaching
more effective” (Newman & Beetham, 2017). In Spain, a study was carried out to
identify the use of technology by teachers, being interested both in the
frequency and in the use of it, as well as in the type of learning activities in which
they use, for which 941 professors from 9 universities were interviewed. public ades and 1

intense intervention in which technologies support the process of appropriation of
knowledge by students through productive learning and
communicative experiences (Marcelo, Yot, & Mayor, 2015).
Digital transformation models
Three important models were identified with the systematic review of literature that were
developed mainly in digital transformation in educational institutions
higher, such models include digital capability and IT capability as elements
immersed in digital transformation.
1. In Spain in the doctoral thesis developed by Fernando Enrique Almaraz Menéndez
talks about the implications of the digital transformation process in the Institutions of
Higher Education, the study was carried out mainly for the University of
Salamanca. This research generates as a result a theoretical model for the analysis
of digital transformation in universities in which they indicate levels of analysis and
dimensions as visualized in figure 1. (Almaraz Menéndez, 2016).

According to the author, the model has been created specifically for the University of
Salamanca, however, can serve as a tool to test the model in other
contexts.
2. In Slovenia, M. Kozina & V. Kirinić carry out a measurement of digital capabilities in
IES in 2018 using a digital capability maturity model (DCMM) see
Figure 2. The evaluation results were collected within the institution of
higher education and refer mainly to process innovations that digitize
higher education and the implementation of educational technology, as well as
digitization of services to support teaching, learning, evaluation processes
and the digitization of IT services to support the institution's other processes.
The authors include eight management disciplines and an additional discipline to evaluate the
digital transformation management (Kozina & Kirinić, 2018).

3. Pekka Kähkipuro 2017 proposes a layered IT capability model for
digital transformation in higher education for Brunel University London, see
Figure 3. For the definition he uses two frameworks to describe the changes: (i) characterizes
various aspects of digital transformation in higher education at the institutional and
(ii) analyzes the new expectations of the role of IT within the institution. It indicates that the
model can be used in other organizations, however it should take its
own strategies as a starting point and follow the steps of this model to
create the required list of IT capabilities. (Pekka Kähkipuro, 2017).

Latin American Context
International Data Corporation IDC (2016) prepares an analysis on the maturity of
Latin American universities in the digital transformation which indicates that the
institutions have slow progress, four out of 10 institutions are resistant

As a conclusion of the study, they indicate that it is necessary to improve the use of
IT infrastructure in HEIs, review strategies in terms of execution and leadership
for digital transformation projects taking into account the entire community
university.
Colombian Context
In Colombia, several studies have been carried out in order to know the maturity index
of organizations regarding digital transformation, one of these studies was
prepared by Cintel, a company of innovative IT projects where the first measurement
was developed in 2016 and 2018 in order to identify the progress of the
organizations. The result shows a growth in the global maturity index of
digital transformation of 9.1%, going from 57.8 points in 2016 to 62.88 points in
2018, in this study they included the educational sector and the conclusions indicated that
The increase in the use of technology such as data analytics shows the need
of organizations to have processed, structured and organized information15
for decision making, in the same way, without ignoring the appropriation of technology
by organizations, as well as the management of technological change, the misuse of
technology and the fear of organizing it on the part of collaborators, are identified as
the main obstacles to the implementation of technological solutions in the
organization (Cintel Innovative IT Projects, 2018).
Likewise, the National Association of Businessmen of Colombia (Andi) developed a
digital transformation survey in 2017 in which it indicates that 58.4% of
Entrepreneurs are adopting new business models and are aware of the 4IR,
65.2% of the total businessmen expressed themselves positively with very high percentages.
similar between the industrial sector (65.1%) and the services sector (65.3%). On the other hand, the
process is much faster in service companies (71.4%) than in industry
(48.4%) in 2017. According to the businessmen surveyed, the main areas, with
greatest impact digitally transformed in the next two years, are innovation in
products and services (77.3%), the customer relations area (74.5%), the
internal and organizational processes (73.6%) and the area of ​​new business models
and income streams (60%). In addition to this, the main challenges faced today by
companies to achieve a successful digital transformation are, in their order, lack of culture
(74.1%), ignorance (61.6%) and budget (56.3%) (ANDI, 2017).
The main obstacle that these surveys show in the implementation of a
successful digital transformation is the organizational culture, the misuse of technologies and
the fear of using them of the Institutions' collaborators.
The Government of Colombia in its Global Development Plan 2018-2022 Pact for Colombia,
Pact for Equity formulates the National Digital Transformation and Intelligence Policy
Artificial which seeks to boost productivity and promote the well-being of citizens,
as well as generate the transversal enablers for the sectoral digital transformation, of
so that Colombia can take advantage of the opportunities and face the challenges
related to the Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR). (National Department of
DNP Planning, 2019). The public policy existing until now has three limitations
that must be overcome:16
(i) Digital transformation policies have been more oriented to
Government in order to make the citizen-State relationship more efficient, not
However, although there is progress in the matter, it is necessary to accelerate the
step to be at the forefront of the most recent developments in the
digital government field;
(ii) Given the speed of technological change that is being experienced, the country
must still promote knowledge and skills among citizens
digital solutions necessary to face the changes in the structures
economic and social that the 4IR brings;
(iii) Competitiveness and productivity policies have incorporated the
digital technologies, although not with the relevance and depth required
the 4IR.
The National University of Colombia – UN accepts the policies proposed by the
Ministry of ICT and considers it as the main pillar within its Strategic Project
Institutional for the Global Development Plan (PGD) 2019-2021, “digital transformation”
to create a culture that transforms learning and goes hand in hand with the new
technologies (National University of Colombia, 2019), the vision of this pillar is up to the
year 2030; The general objective is to foster a community attuned at the University
with innovation, through a digital transformation, where the advancement of technology
and emerging trends maximize collaboration, active learning,
research and creation (Arango Serna et al., 2019).
Currently the University has an approximate model of digital transformation
2030 depicted on the Parthenon monument as visualized in figure 4, which was
created as a result of different workshops carried out with the directives and areas of
information technology carried out at the end of 2018 in which the
expectations and needs of Headquarters regarding the issue of digital transformation. He
proposed model for the University establishes some possible scenarios (study
prospective) in the processes of organizational transformation and digital transformation of
the University.17

focused on Higher Education Institutions.
• The level of advancement of digital capabilities will be identified at the UN Manizales Headquarters.
• The lines of action for digital transformation based on digital capabilities
They will be established for the UN Headquarters Manizales.
1.5 Methodology
For the development of the final master's thesis, a mixed methodology is followed, which is the
systematic integration of quantitative and qualitative methods in a single study with the
in order to obtain a more complete “photograph” of the phenomenon. (Sampieri Hernández Roberto,
Collado Fernández Carlos, 2010). Likewise, a methodological approach is followed
experimental, exploratory type, according to what Sampieri (2010) points out:
“Exploratory studies are carried out when the objective is to examine a topic or
little studied research problem, about which there are many doubts or not
has been addressed before. That is, when the review of the literature revealed how
there are only unresearched guides and ideas vaguely related to the problem
of study, or, if we want to investigate topics and areas from new
perspectives”.
This exploratory study will also combine descriptive aspects, since the studies
Descriptives “aim to measure or collect information independently or jointly.”
about the concepts or variables to which they refer, that is, their objective is not to indicate
how these are related” (Sampieri Hernández Roberto, Collado Fernández Carlos,
2010).19
The methodology is integrated into three stages:

The systematic literature review (RSL) methodology proposed by
Kitchenham (2007) which consists of presenting an evaluation of a research topic
through the use of a reliable, rigorous and auditable methodology. The process of
search, as can be seen in figure 5, consists of 3 phases: planning
the review, development of the review and publication of results.

guide (Kitchenham, 2007), researchers must summarize all existing information
about some phenomenon in an exhaustive and impartial manner, in order to establish
general conclusions that individual studies or as a beginning of activities
of future research.
Identification of the need for review
This identification establishes the objective of the review, the questions of
research and what resources are available to carry it out.
The objective of the review is to carry out a systematic search of literature in order to
determine existing best practices for assessing digital capabilities in
higher education institutions.
The specification of the research questions is the paradigm by which
studies and classifies bibliographic material, therefore, what is sought to be established is what
following:
P1. What is meant by digital capabilities?
P2. How to determine existing best practices for assessing capabilities
digital in an HEI?
P3. How many studies have been published in recent years on best practices of
digital capabilities in HEIs?
Q4. What are the existing models and methodologies to evaluate the capabilities
digital in Higher Education Institutions?
Q5. Which studies have been validated in Institutions d e Higher Education?22
Development of the search protocol
Guz and Rushchitsky (2009) and Aghaei Chadegani et al., (2013) establish that the bases of
most widespread data in the scientific field and widely used in searches for
literature are Scopus and Web of Science, hence they have been selected as the bases
of data to be used in the development of the systematic literature review. However, and
Given the relevance that Google Scholar has taken on in recent years, it was decided
incorporate it into the study as a complement to the search process.
As part of the search strategy, the following search string was adopted to
Scopus and Web of Science databases:
(“digital competence” OR “digital literacy” OR “digital inclusion”) AND (model OR
methodology OR strategy OR evaluation OR “maturity model”) AND (“higher
education” OR university).
To carry out the search within the databases, the title, summary and
keywords, as a strategy to improve the precision of information search
(Spante, Hashemi, Lundin, & Algers, 2018). Likewise, no
temporal restriction and its search was restricted to articles and reviews in Spanish language
and English. The search is delimited by defining a publication interval, in this case between
2015 to 2020 in order to identify what have been the most recent practices in relation
with digital capabilities and corroborate what has been the current view on the issue of
investigation.
When searching for information without any time restriction, it was noted that some
terms were confused with other branches such as medicine and engineering and in a second

Selection of primary studies
For the manual selection of publications, a first filter is made where 51 documents
They were excluded because they were duplicated, that is, they were in more than two bases.
of data the same article. Subsequently, an initial review of the topic is carried out in
general and 78 articles are excluded because they are related to primary basic education or
secondary school, were in a specific area such as health or were related to
specific tools such as blogs, wiki, etc. With selected publications 203
are included, the title and summary of the article is reviewed and
exclude 70 documents (25 They had to do with specific areas such as history, science
social, nursing, archaeology, bachelor's degrees, 18 with software promotion

specific learning objectives that are not related to the study). Likewise, it
excludes a document because it was not available. 7 items included
relevant ones that were searched through Google and selected from various pages of
research journals on digital models and capabilities in educational institutions

Colombia.
In total 139 publications were evaluated for the research.
Study quality assessment
Once the relevant studies have been selected based on the analysis of the title and abstract,
A manual assessment is carried out using tools such as Mendely and Excel,
The articles studied were classified according to the number of citations that each presents.
article in Scopus and Web of Science, finally we proceed to evaluate the studies
trying to answer the research questions. The categories were the following:
evaluation (digital capabilities, digital literacy), strategy, model (capacity
digital, digital literacy), digital competence framework, methodology and also
includes systematic review of literature in relation to definitions of competence
digital.25
Data extraction and tracking
As can be seen in Figure 7, it is found that the vast majority (52% of
articles) were assessments of digital competence or digital literacy applied to
students and teachers in HEIs where some specific dimensions were analyzed,
while strategies (18% of articles) refer to certain tactics used
by some HEIs whether they are instruments or software to determine their digital capabilities.
In the review, articles related to systematic literature review were detected.
(12% of articles) through which concepts of digital capabilities are determined,
digital literacy, digital skills. Taking into account that the object of this
study is to find the best practices to evaluate digital capabilities in an HEI,
Priority will be given to documents related to the competence framework categories
digital, model and methodology (17% of articles) that mostly mention
some models in general that are used internationally.

Without time restriction in the selection phase, Figure 8 shows that we talk about
digital skills since 2005, however it began to have importance
from the year 2010 (Lindroth & Bergquist, 2010) and it is from of 2015 that the number of
publications on best practices of digital capabilities grow, with 2020 being the
year that stands out.

2.1.4 Results
Conceptualization of digital competence and digital literacy
To begin with the main foundation of this work, a search is carried out for the
major studies in the area and outlines the terms of competence, literacy or
digital skills that these concepts are often used synonymously although
have different meanings (Martin & Grudziecki, 2006), therefore, it is necessary to give
conceptual clarity of these terms. Digital competence is about skills
essential for life, they are even conceived as “survival skills in the era
digital” (Eshet-alkalai, 2004) or “vital assets in the information society” (A. Van
Deursen & Dijk, 2010). Ala-Mutka (2011) points out competence as the ability to
apply knowledge and skills in different contexts, such as work, leisure or
learning (Ala-mutka, 2011). According to Deursen (2010) literacy refers to
certain competencies and knowledge, while skills refer to
the more technical aspects of these skills and knowledge.
Iordache, Mariën & Baelden (2017) agree with Alka-Mutka (2011) by indicating that:
Digital competence is discussed as the ability to apply these
knowledge and skills to various contexts of life, from
personal to professional. To do this, digital literacy collects the
awareness, practical skills and competencies necessary to
for users to access, understand, evaluate, communicate with others
and create digital content in a strategic and applied way. (Iordache,
Mariën, & Baelden, 2017, p. 10).
According to Ferrari (2012), he defines digital competence as:
“The set of knowledge, skills, attitudes (including abilities,
strategies, values ​​and awareness) that are required when using the
ICT and digital media to carry out tasks; solve problems;
communicate; manage information; to collaborate; create and share content;28
and build knowledge in an effective, efficient, appropriate, critical,
creative, autonomous, flexible, ethical and reflective for work, leisure,
participation, learning, socialization, consumption and
empowerment” (p. 3).
In this same sense, Larraz (2013) understands digital competence as the some of
literacies (technological or computer, informational, audiovisual or media and
communicative) to participate in a safe, ethical and civic way of a digital identity.
In general, it can be seen how the various authors perceive digital competence as
a set of essential life skills and their application and digital literacy
is the compilation of these skills and knowledge such as technological, communicative,
informational, audiovisual and skills are understood as something more technical than those
skills and knowledge.
Based on the review of concepts from different authors, this project assumes the
concept of digital competence by Iordache, Mariën, & Baelden, 2017 and Ferrari (2012)
as the set of knowledge, skills and attitudes that are needed when
use ICT and digital media, and the ability to apply them in various contexts of the
life from personal to professional.
Thus, after the clarification of the concepts of digital competence and digital literacy that was
explained above, a review and comparison of the best
practices converted into models and frameworks of digital competence.29
Review and evaluation of digital competence best practices
In the bibliographic review, it was possible to find a series of studies related to
standards, frameworks and models of competencies or digital literacy, eight (8) of them
with relevance at the international level and one (1) at the national level applied to an HEI.
To carry out the content analysis of each of the studies, the following are defined
Selection criteria:
1. The number of references in other studies and recognized in the literature
specialized.
2. They had to be relevant to the discussion of digital competence or literacy
around the analysis of digital skills and competencies found
included in the selected models and frameworks.
3. The studies could be applied in higher education institutions, therefore
For this reason, some of them are focused on teaching, while others are applicable
to any type of institutions.
4. Its structure was built as a frame, with a classification of
skills, knowledge and competencies.
5. Your publication had to cover the last 7 years, between 2013 and 2019
respectively. Although one of the selected frames is from 2007 (due to
number of citations) and its relevance in the specialized literature was taken into account to
have a comparison with the other selected studies.
Based on this review, it was decided to exclude three (3) studies and select six (6).
The excluded studies were the following:
1. ICDL (International Computer Digital Literacy) Standard: ICDL is an organization
international which has a knowledge certification program
computing, this standard measures a person's ability to handle a
computer, drive to basic IT concepts. Despite being an international standard
is not included because its structure only includes basic knowledge of
computing, is not constructed as a framework which is required for analysis.30
2. Model for the development and accreditation of Digital Competence at the University
Virginia Larraz Rada (2013): It is a model created at the University of Andorra, its
objective is to develop and accredit the competence of students, it is a model
little recognized by specialized literature and unclear in its content.
3. NETS-T Standard (2008): It is a standard developed by the International Society for
Technology in Education (ISTE Standards) (2008), is recognized worldwide
international as a standard for teaching and focused on learning, without
However, for the development of this work and when reviewing the other studies where three
of them focus on teaching and can be implemented in other settings,
It was decided not to include the NETS-T standard in the evaluation.
The six (6) studies mentioned below were selected according to
to the criteria:
1) As a relevant study, the UNESCO 2019 “Framework of
ICT competencies of teachers (ICT-CFT)” as a tool
to guide the initial and ongoing training of teachers on the use of ICT
throughout the educational system. It is an international framework which has had several
versions 2008, 2011 and now 2018. This instrument is designed to adapt to
national and institutional objectives, providing an updated framework for the
Policy making and capacity development in this dynamic area
(UNESCO, 2019).
The Framework is organized into three stages or successive levels of development of the
teachers regarding the pedagogical use of ICT
• Acquisition of knowledge
• Deepening of knowledge
• Knowledge creation
In turn, the framework consists of 18 competencies organized around the six aspects
of the professional practice of teachers, at three levels of pedagogical use of the
ICT by teachers. The underlying idea is that teachers who have competencies31
to use ICT in their professional practice will provide quality education and in
Ultimately they will be able to effectively guide the development of the competencies of the
students in ICT matters.
The six aspects of teachers' professional practice are as follows:
1. Understanding the role of ICT in educational policies;
2. Curriculum and evaluation;
3. Pedagogy;
4. Application of digital skills;
5. Organization and administration; and
6. Professional learning of teachers.
2) The iSkills model developed by (Educational Testing Service ETS, 2007) is another of
selected studies, is an outcomes-based framework that measures the ability
to think critically in a digital environment. ETS is an international institution
which is recognized for its ectory in the development of accreditation for both students
like the citizen, establishes a digital literacy framework called:
“Digital Transformation: a framework for ICT literacy” in its definition of literacy
in ICT identify five components that they consider essential and that represent a
continuum of skills and knowledge for functioning in a society of
knowledge. Each of the components is defined by ETS as follows:
• Access: Know and know how to collect and/or retrieve information.
• Manage: Apply an existing organizational or classification scheme.
• Integrate: Interpret and represent information. It involves summarizing, comparing and
to contrast.
• Evaluate: Make judgments about the quality, relevance, usefulness or efficiency of the
information.
• Create: Generate information by adapting, applying, designing, inventing or
creating information.32
3) Another of the selected studies developed by the European Commission (IPTS, DG
EAC) – DIGCOMP 2013 (Anusca Ferrari, Punie, & Bre, 2013) which creates the project
to develop a digital competence framework that emerges from 15 frameworks and the
contribution of 95 experts, has been a reference in most studies because it is a
framework applied in different contexts and is used to guide the identification of a
limited set of indicators in order to measure digital competition between countries
It includes 21 competencies organized into five dimensions. This framework of
competition has several updates, the original version was created in the
2013 by Ferrari, in 2016 the DIGCOMP 2.0 version is published (Vuorikari, Punie,
Carretero, & Van Den Brande, 2016) in which they update their terminology, the model
conceptual and show some examples of its application at the European level,
national and regional:
a) Information and digital literacy: Browsing, searching and filtering
information, evaluation of information, storage and retrieval of
information
b) Online communication and collaboration: Interaction through technologies,
share information and content, participate in online citizenship,
collaborating through digital channels, netiquette, identity management
digital
c) Creation of digital content: Content development, Integration and
reworking, copyright and licenses, Programming
d) Security: Protection of devices, protection of personal data,
health protection, environmental protection.
e) Problem solving: Resolution of technical problems, identification of
technological needs and responses, innovate and use technology in a way
creative, identification of digital competence gaps.
For the purposes of model analysis, DIGCOMP version 2.0.33 will be used.
4) Similarly, the proposed digital skills measurement model is selected.
by (V. Deursen & Van Dijk, 2014) in which it is stated that the digital and the social are
related by similar types of fields (economic, cultural, social and
personal). The authors propose a set of skills on the Internet because
They consider them to be a key part of digital inclusion. The approach has led to
search for instruments that are capable of measuring what abilities people have
people, how they relate to certain types of participation and how these can
subsequently affect specific aspects of daily life. This model was
applied in Holland with a sample of 108,000 people and a response was obtained from
1,107 people.
The model proposes four sets of skills to navigate the Internet:
a) Operational skills to navigate the Internet.
b) Formal skills to navigate the Internet.
c) Internet navigation skills related to content and
information.
d) Strategic skills to navigate the Internet.
5) Another of the selected studies was developed by (Kozina & Kirinić, 2018) in
Slovenia, in which a measurement of digital capabilities is carried out in HEIs in the year
2018 using a digital capability maturity model (DCMM). The results
of the evaluation were collected within the higher education institution and were
They mainly refer to process innovations that digitize education
higher education and the implementation of educational technology, as well as the digitalization of
services to support the processes of teaching, learning, evaluation and
digitization of IT services to support the other processes of the institution.
Business transformation management includes 9 disciplines:
a) Strategy management.
b) Value management.
c) Risk management.
d) Program and project management.
e) Skills management and training.34
f) Business process management.
g) Management of organizational change.
h) Transformational IT management.
i) Metamanagement.
6) At the national level, the experimental theoretical model proposed by
Melo Solarte, Díaz, Vega, & Serna, (2018), which was carried out at the University of
Manizales and whose purpose was to characterize and evaluate technological competencies
that the different actors who are part of an academic community have
university. To create the model, they use the classification of
competencies proposed by UNESCO in 2008, but they expanded the spectrum to
all actors in a university community: teachers, students and
administrative, in addition, focusing the analysis on the appropriation and use
technological within the role that each one plays. They use the five dimensions
raised by UNESCO 2008: 1) Technological, 2) Informational, 3) Pedagogical, 4)
Communicational, 5) Axiological and additionally propose a sixth dimension in
productive order that determines the use of ICT in the training process
or in their daily activities. In addition, they add another dimension of productive order.
with which they intend to identify the importance that technologies have
both in the training process of people and in their daily activities.
Evaluation of digital competence frameworks or models
To evaluate the frameworks and models, a quick scan analysis is performed as it describes
multiple small case studies based on a limited set of
variables. By mapping the variables and their indices into a single array it becomes possible to
analysis of similarities, differences and variances between the cases (Audenhove, Baelden, &
Mariën, 2015). This is how the digital skills and competencies found are analyzed
For each of the models and frameworks, a matrix is ​​created with the competencies
similarities that were found in each of the studies, classifying them into five
categories:35
1) Operations for the use of ICT.
2) Information and knowledge.
3) Digital communication.
4) Creation of digital content.
5) Strategic competencies.
Likewise, each of these categories contains its criteria that in total added up
twenty-one (21) which have been mapped using a matrix, as can be seen
observe in table 2, for each of the studies in such a way that it could be identified
the similarities or differences between them and determine which of them could be evaluated in a
complete digital competencies in an HEI. This comparison is made
through a visual analysis and review of the literature, therefore, it was not an analysis
statistical even though there are numerical results in the matrix.
For the development of the matrix, the cases that are the models and frameworks are mapped into
columns and criteria are mapped to rows, additional rows are introduced to determine
the number of themes that a given case shows. (Audenhove et al., 2015). The
Selected categories are shown in the following table:36

1. Operational skills for the use of ICT
The first category (see table 3) refers to the skills that a person has.
person in the management of ICT. In competency and literacy models and frameworks
analyzed, it is shown that four (4) of its six (6) criteria are the basis in the
most of the studies from the oldest to the most current such as: knowing and
use software, know and use hardware, know and use the internet and manage structures
digital media that is related to the management of the same digital media such as
hyperlinks, menus and navigation.
Regarding privacy and protection of information, they are found in the studies
(DIGCOM, 2016, Melo Solarte, 2018; UNESCO, 2019) which is a topic that is today
relevant to the issue of the processing of personal data. Regarding the security of
devices has only been identified by the DIGCOMP competency framework (2016) the
which highlights the importance of protecting the d devices and understand the risks and
online threats to know the security measures.
2. Information and knowledge competencies
The second category (see table 3) focuses on the ability to understand, evaluate and
have judgment regarding information. In this sense, the six studies evaluated coincide
in the importance of having criteria for analysis and evaluation of information in such a way
that a judgment can be made about the quality, usefulness and effectiveness of the same information. Of
Likewise, all studies agree with the information literacy criterion
which consists of the ability to search, identify, select, locate, access,
recover, store, disseminate and share information, these actions are those that take
users when trying to satisfy information needs. (V. Deursen & Van
Dijk, 2016).
In relation to the criterion “digital problem-solving skills” it is discussed by the
vast majority of models and frameworks analyzed, there are authors who consider the resolution of
problems in their areas of competence and define it as the ability to: “Identify
digital needs and resources, make informed decisions about tools
most appropriate digital technologies according to the purpose or need, solve conceptual problems40
through digital media, creatively use technologies, solve problems
technicians, update one's own and other's competence." (Vuorikari et al., 2016)
According to the criterion “support for others in the development of digital competence” it is not indicated
explicitly in the studies, however, three of them mention collaborative work
as one of its items to evaluate, in this case support groups are important to
skill development. The competency framework proposed by UNESCO being a
model designed for teachers, indicates that it is necessary to use digital tools
flexibly, to facilitate collaborative learning, manage students and other
parties involved in learning, and manage the learning process (UNESCO,
2019). Research has shown that users often rely on various
support groups to develop skills and competencies, outside the school environment
formal education (Hobbs, 2010).
3. Digital communication skills
The third category (see table 3) is related to communication skills.
digital, when reviewing the models and macros it is highlighted that in the vast majority there are
much of the criteria such as constructing and understanding messages and interacting online,
Some authors see the importance of communication because it distributes and manages, to
understand the appropriate ways to communicate through digital media, to
refer to different communication formats, to adapt the modes and strategies of
communication in a specific audience interact and collaborate online (Vuorikari et al.,
2016).
Likewise, “l Participation in online networks and communities” was mentioned in five
studies except for Kozina & Kirinić. Regarding the criterion “manage an identity
digital” was mentioned in very few studies, Voorikari et al. (2016) mention it as
one of the criteria in relation to communication and indicates that creating, adapting and managing
one or more digital identities is important to be able to protect one's reputation and
process data that is produced across multiple accounts and applications. With respect to
general behavior on the internet, just like the previous criterion is mentioned by
Four of the studies indicate that it must be learned in practice, since there is no guide41
formal available (V. Deursen & Van Dijk, 2014), and they emphasize the importance of ensuring the
correction of behavior and actions when interacting with other people online
(UNESCO, 2008).
4. Digital content creation skills
The fourth category consists of digital content creation skills (see table
3), the criteria “create and edit new content / build new knowledge and produce
creative expressions”, in the vast majority of models and macros they consider it as
a way to innovate, generate information by adapting, applying, designing, inventing
(Educational Testing Service ETS, 2007), both criteria go hand in hand with “integrate and
mixing existing content”, is a relevant element in the development of
digital skills. And regarding the criterion “knowledge and management of the rights of
intellectual property (IPR) and licensing” has been discussed in three of the studies, for
Both respect for property rights are valued, hence the
Users should not only know the rules about using existing work, but
They must also be able to understand the different types of licenses and apply them
correctly to their own digital production (Vuorikari et al., 2016).
5. Strategic competencies
In the fifth category speaks of strategic competencies (see table 3), the vast majority of
studies include the criterion of “using the information towards personal goals or
professionals”, some indicate that strategic competencies are management skills
more advanced internet and affirm that it is necessary that they be linked to decision-making
decisions and notions of empowerment (V. Deursen & Van Dijk, 2014). As for the
criterion “identify digital competence gaps”, three studies discuss this topic,
and Melo Solarte (2018) refers to the fact that every institution must have
technological management that determines the viability of the acquisition of technologies. Besides,
must have appropriation strategies to reduce gaps and better achieve
utilization of the investment.42
From the previous table, it can be seen in table 4 that the models with a
compliance greater than 90.00% of the twenty-one (21) criteria evaluated in the five (5)
identified categories were:
• DIGCOMP Digital Competency Framework version 2.0 Vuorikari et al., 2016.
• Unesco ICT teacher competency framework version 3 2019.
• Measurement model of the digital situation in IES Melo Solarte et al., 2018.
The model with the lowest percentage of compliance (52.00%) in the evaluated criteria
corresponds to Digital Capability Maturity Model in HEIs (DCMM) Kozina & Kirinić,
2018.

For the purposes of establishing the measurement of digital competencies at the University
Colombian National headquarters Manizales, and based on the results obtained in the analysis
of the variables of each of the models, it is concluded that the reference model to
develop is DIGCOMP Digital Competency Framework version 2.0. Vuorikari et al., 2016.
This digital competence framework is summarized in the following table:

digital at the Manizales Headquarters
The objective of this stage of the study is to identify the level of progress
of digital capabilities at UN Headquarters Manizales. To achieve this objective, in
First, an instrument is designed based on the digital competence framework
selected in the previous chapter, in this case DIGCOMP 2.0, and later it is
applicable to the University community of the Manizales Campus, once the application has been made
The data collected is tabulated and analyzed, indicating the reliability of the
instrument and finally the conclusions are made about the level of advancement of the capabilities
digital at the UN Headquarters Manizales.
3.1 Instrument design
In the previous chapter, a systematic literature review is carried out to determine the
best practices to evaluate digital capabilities in HEIs, a review is carried out and
categorization of the variables found from six models or competency frameworks
digital and according to the evaluation it is concluded that the reference model to be developed
for fulfilling 100% of the competencies and variables analyzed is the framework of
digital competence DIGCOMP 2.0 (Vuorikari et al., 2016), and from this framework of
competition the instrument is built.
The purpose of the instrument is to identify the digital capabilities of the community
university of the UN Headquarters Manizales, to meet this objective the 45
GQM (Goal-Question-Metric) approach, which is used to define, adjust and evaluate a
group of objectives that a project or an organization requires and that can be measured. TO
Through GQM, objectives are refined into questions and metrics are defined that provide the
information necessary to answer these questions. (Basili, Caldiera, & Rombach,
1994).
The resulting definition model consists of three levels:
1. The conceptual level (Goal): It refers to the objectives, an objective is defined to
an object, for a variety of reasons, with respect to various quality models,
from various points of view, in relation to a particular environment. The objects of
measure can be products, processes or resources (Caldiera & Rombach, 1994). For
In the case of this study, the objects will be the areas of competences defined from
of the DIGCOMP 2.0 reference framework (Anuska Ferrari, 2012). The objects are summarized
as follows:
• Object etive 1 Information and information literacy: Articulating needs
information, locate and recover digital data, information and content. Judge
the relevance of the sources and their content. Store, manage and organize data

• Objective 5 Problem solving: Identify needs and problems, and
solve conceptual problems and problematic situations in digital environments.
Use digital tools to innovate processes and products. Keep
updated with digital evolution.
2. At the operational level (Question): Generate a set of questions to characterize
the way in which the achievements of a specific objective will be valued (Caldiera & Rombach,
1994). To meet the objectives of this study, the questions are constructed from
of the DIGCOMP 2.0 framework, Table 6 refers to five areas
specific with 19 indices from which 32 questions are specified. The frame
DIGCOMP 2.0 digital competence has not developed a specific instrument,
Therefore, when performing the literature review, four (4) studies were found that
developed instruments for measuring digital capabilities based on the model
DIGCOMP, so, the questions used to meet the objectives and the
survey construction for this project were adapted by the following
authors:
• Contreras-Germán, Piedrahita-Ospina, & Ramírez-Velásquez, 2019, the items
evaluated from the instrument proposed by the authors present a high degree of
internal consistency meeting reliability criteria.
• Cabero Almenara, Gutiérrez Castillo, Palacios Rodríguez, & Barroso Osuna,
2020, instrument validation results indicate a high degree
reliability and validity.
• Gutiérrez-Castillo, Cabero-Almenara, & Estrada-Vidal, 2017 propose a
instrument called “Digital Campus” which is a valid test of
diagnosis of knowledge about digital competence.
• Touron, Martin, Navarro Asencio, Pradas, & Íñigo, 2018, the quality of the
tool proposed by the authors obtains high reliability indices and

• The quantitative level (Metric): Indicates a set of data associated with each
question in order to answer it quantitatively. These data or metrics
can be objective (they depend only of the object of study that is measured and not
from the point of view from which they are collected, for example, number of versions of the
document, program size) or subjective (they depend on the object of study that is
measured and from the point of view (for example, user satisfaction).
Figure 10 indicates how the GQM approach is a hierarchical structure that begins with a
objective which a series of questions is derived and each of the questions is broken down
some metrics. The same metric can be used to respond to different
questions under the same objective. (Basili et al., 1994).51

3.2.1 Definition of the type of instrument in the research
The instrument to be used in this research corresponds to the electronic survey, which
contains a set of standardized questions addressed to a representative sample of
the population under study (POE), in order to know states of opinion or facts
specific; These have as their objective the collection of statistical information
quantitative and/or qualitative (Zikmund, William G., 2008).
The survey1 aims to identify the level of advancement of digital capabilities in
the UN Headquarters Manizales. The population segment that has been decided to choose within the
university community of the Uni National University of Manizales Manizales Headquarters, which
corresponds to twelve Annex Instrument Identification of digital capabilities in the

Advancement of digital capabilities at UN Headquarters Manizales. Now, from the point
From an investigative point of view, various authors propose that observation stimulates curiosity,
promotes the development of new facts that may be of scientific interest, stimulates
problem statement and corresponding hypothesis.
So, observation can be used with the support of other procedures or
techniques (survey, interview, among others), allowing a comparison of the
results obtained by different means, which are completed and allow achieving a
greater precision in the information collected.
It is worth mentioning that descriptive research, unlike research
exploratory is formal and structured, so the results will be considered as
input information for the decision-making process and final recommendations.
This study is carried out with a representative sample2 of the population to be studied, and the
Data will be analyzed quantitatively. Therefore, this study employs an approach
quantitative, which consists of the integration of the quantitative method, based on the
elements that make up the research; Firstly, it uses descriptive research
to systematically represent the characteristics of a situation or area of ​​interest
specific, in which case the survey allows identifying the level of progress of the

3.2.4 Instrument application
Before submitting the instrument to pilot testing, there were 34 questions according to
to the GQM methodology, using a Likert scale with five response levels
(Never, Almost Never, Sometimes, Almost always, Always), which were evaluated
by a professional expert in proofreading, who indicates that there were 4 questions in
several areas that meant the same thing, but with different words, therefore it suggests leaving
only 2 of these, thus leaving 32 questions, likewise, modifications are made to
writing to clarify some questions. Additionally, a
question series demographics such as: role (teacher, undergraduate student, student
graduate, administrative, contractor), gender, age range and level of education.
Subsequently, a pilot test is carried out with 14 surveys applied to 8
students, a teacher and 5 administrators with the purpose of identifying and correcting errors
that may be presented in the application of the instrument. Time was not limited with
purpose of determining how long they would take. The form is used as a tool
Google, since it allows you to add different types of questions and the link is sent through
institutional email. The suggestion is received to give greater clarity at the beginning
of the application of the instrument in terms of time and number of questions, likewise,
An administrator suggests giving examples in question No. 1 related to the
metasearch engines, no more suggestions are received from the survey.
In the data collection phase, it is used as a tool to design the instrument
the Google form since it is an application that the University has and is used
through institutional email and facilitates sending the message only to the community
University of the Headquarters, likewise, provides the tabulation of the data for its
spreadsheet storage and graphical display of information. He
questionnaire3 is sent by institutional email randomly to the
administrative staff (plant and contractors), staff teachers, undergraduate students and
postgraduate, with a message indicating the objective of the study and the link to the survey.

From the results obtained in the investigation carried out through the survey
applied to undergraduate and graduate students, faculty, administrators of
plant and contractors, the characterization of the digital capabilities of the
National University of Colombia Manizales headquarters considering each of the areas of
competencies of the DIGCOMP 2.0 model, likewise, three levels of measurement of
the indexes: basic level A (has basic knowledge and understands how to do it), level
intermediate B (has the ability to apply or do) and advanced level (has the ability to
propose strategies, be critical and participate in practice). The areas of competence are
the following:
3.3.1.1 Area of ​​competence information and information literacy
The information and information literacy competency area has three associated
indexes, Table 12 shows the results of each index for each of the roles.

In the previous table, it was identified in the first index that all roles without exception have
basic knowledge regarding navigation, search and filtering of data, information
and digital content being at a basic level, however, regular teachers65
(45%) and graduate students (40%) with a significant percentage, tend to
show abilities higher than the basic level and are at an intermediate level, which indicates that
They have the ability to locate information and digital resources in different formats,
in addition to expressing the needs they require in search engines and databases
of specialized data. For undergraduate students, it is important to strengthen the
data search and filtering capabilities since only 28% are found in a
Upper level.
Regarding index 2, it can be seen in figure 17 how all the roles are found in a
intermediate level, which denotes that they have the ability to compare and evaluate
different sources of information, data and digital content found on the internet.
It also shows that teachers are at a level above the basic level (64.6%
intermediate level and 31.3% advanced level), this shows that they have the capacity
to evaluate information and digital content in their activities teaching ades. So
Likewise, it can be seen that administrators (15.3%), contractors (10.5%), students of
undergraduate (15.6%) and graduate students (11.2%) are at a basic level, this
It means that they know that not all the information on the Internet is reliable, but they need to have the
ability to compare and have judgment when evaluating information.

Figure 18 shows how all the roles are located at an intermediate level, which
demonstrates the ability they have to save, label files, content and
information, in addition to knowing how to recover and manage information from the contents that
have saved. Likewise, contractors (50% advanced and 45% intermediate),
undergraduate students (45% advanced and 49% intermediate), graduate students (44%
advanced and 49% intermediate) have a significant percentage at the advanced level, this
reflects that they know how to apply strategies to recover and manage the information they have
saved, as well as combining local storage with cloud storage
to organize digital information.

Although figure 19 indicates that administrators, contractors, teachers and students of
undergraduate and graduate degrees are at an intermediate level where it is denoted that they have the
ability to share files and content via emails or other
digital media, there is a trend in administrative (25%), teachers (25%),
undergraduate (28.04%) and graduate (28.04%) students to decrease active participation
At the advanced level, that is, sharing your knowledge, content and resources to
through online communities, networks and collaboration platforms, while
contractors have a greater participation in sharing their knowledge (42.11%).68

When mentioning citizen participation (see figure 20), it is seen that both
administrators, contractors, teachers, undergraduate and graduate students are
at a level between intermediate and advanced, which reflects the ability they have to access
actively to a series of specific networks and communities for different purposes,
Furthermore, those who are at an advanced level have the ability to participate and express
their opinions in different virtual spaces. However, there is a percentage of
undergraduate students (21.3%), graduate students (25%), teachers (25%),
contractors (10.55) and administrative workers (18.8%) who make passive or no use in terms of
participation of online services and networks.

Regarding the collaboration index through digital channels, figure 21 shows how
undergraduate students (55.3%), graduate students (40.2%) and contractors
(47.4%) are regular users in professional development networks and have the ability
to propose different digital tools and technologies for collaborative processes
placing itself at an advanced level. On the other hand, although teachers (66%) and
administrative staff (70.8%) make less use of professional development networks, they have the
ability to select routine, well-defined tools and technologies to
collaborative processes taking into account their own needs and are located at a level
intermediate. However, 25% of teachers collaborate in a way
basic through traditional technologies such as email, when analyzing the age of
teachers (see figure 22) it is identified that they are older than 45 years, this suggests
that age influences the way we collaborate through digital channels.

It is highlighted that all the participating roles in the study (see figure 23) are in a
higher than basic level, therefore, they have the skills to communicate digitally
and respecting the rules of conduct, are aware and respectful of diversity
cultural in the field of digital communication. Additionally, it is highlighted that the
teachers (54.7%) have developed strategies in order to identify behaviors
inadequate on the network being at an advanced level.

When analyzing the first index of this area, it is seen how all the roles have the capacity
to produce digital content in different formats such as text documents,
presentations, multimedia, image design and even multimedia, in addition, access
through mobile devices or tablets and are located at an intermediate level (see figure 25).
Taking into account that this capacity facilitates the development of activities in the classroom,
The results show about 25% of teachers and 30% of undergraduate students
They are at a basic level, this denotes that they search, create, edit content
digital in a simple and easy way, therefore, it would be important to strengthen the capabilities
to give greater projection in academic activities.72

3.3.2.2 Test reliability
The Cronbach's alpha coefficient carried out through the SPSS v.24 software for the
Reliability estimation under the global internal consistency method showed 0.908
as indicated in table 18; expresses in the same way the percentage of observed variance
attributed to the true variance and the percentage to the variance of the measurement error.80

The Cronbach's Alpha result obtained a scale very close to 1, it can be concluded
that the instrument in general is highly reliable; Furthermore, it is a highly
favorable to perform a factor analysis for dimension reduction. 90.8% of the
variances of the empirical scores is due to the result of covariation between all
the questions on the form, the remaining 9.2% is due to error variance. This
allows the confidence interval to be used as an excellent parameter for the
statistical credibility.
From the results of table 19, it can be seen if, for example, the
element number one (question number 1), the Cronbach's alpha coefficient would decrease to
.902 and there really would not be a substantial difference compared to the coefficient
obtained 0.904. Eliminating element number 26 (question number 26), the coefficient
Cronbach's alpha would increase to .905 and there would not be a substantial difference either, so
Therefore, it is recommended to keep all 32 elements.81

Confidence interval for Cronbach's Alpha coefficient (α) at ​​95%.
The confidence intervals can be estimated using the IC Alpha module (Lara &
Merino, 2015) developed based on the method (Fisher, 1950). The coefficient obtained was
of .904 with 95% CI (LI=0.959 and LS=0.9868). This study allows us to conclude that the IC at
95% for  (LI=0.959 and LS=0.9868); Therefore, it is concluded that the obtained is
statistically significant.82
The interpretation of the confidence intervals is simple, where a lower limit equal to or
greater than 0.90 would provide evidence of excellent reliability. The analysis of the data
internal consistency present in this study allows us to conclude that the total scale (IC =
0.959, 0.9868), present upper limits of confidence intervals above what
minimum required. The above allows us to conclude that there is minimal measurement error in the
test scores, which would not affect the subsequent statistical analyzes and the
conclusions of those studies that will use this scale.

3.3.3 Capacity advancement level report
The study allowed us to investigate the level of digital skills mastery of the community
university of the National University of Colombia Manizales Campus and identify which
are the most relevant aspects that lead to continuous improvement to achieve
progress in levels of competence.
When mentioning the area of ​​competence information and information literacy, the
The highest rated were the contractors, followed by the teachers and students of
postgraduate. It is important to improve capabilities in relation to navigation, search and
filtering of data, information and digital content since the analysis shows
that in all roles the highest percentage are at a basic level, however,
regular teachers (45%) and graduate students (40%) are at a level
intermediate, this shows that they have the ability to use search engines and
specialized databases either for their academic work and research. So
Likewise, in relation to the evaluation of data, information and digital content, it stands out
that teachers have a low percentage of 4.2% at the basic level, likewise the results
showed that the highest percentage is at the intermediate level, however, there is
a minority who are at a basic level: administrative (15.3%), contractors (10.5%),
graduate students (11.2%) and undergraduate students (15.6), being an index that is
located in the area of ​​knowledge, students are required to assume a criterion
when evaluating and verifying the validity of information, data and digital content.
In relation to the level of competence in the area of ​​communication and collaboration despite
that all roles are found enter at a level higher than the basic one, the study presents a
percentage of undergraduates (21.3%), graduate students (25%), teachers (25%),
contractors (10.55) and administrative workers (18.8%) who make passive or no use in the
participation of online services and networks, likewise, there is still 25% of teachers who
They collaborate in a basic way through digital technologies such as email, for example.
Therefore, skills in the use of technological tools could be strengthened for
collaborative processes. On the other hand, it is highlighted that the university community has the87
skills to communicate digitally respecting standards of conduct
placing themselves at an intermediate and advanced level where the best valued in this aspect
It was the teachers.
In the area of ​​creation and digital content, the results indicate that the community
university participating in the study, produce digital content using different
formats and are at an intermediate level, however, a percentage of
administrative (29.2%), contractors (13.2%), teachers (25%), graduate students
(16.8%) and undergraduate students (29.8%) who are at a basic level, this
denotes that they search, create, edit digital content in a simple and easy way, for
Therefore, it would be important to strengthen capabilities to give greater projection in the
academic activities for teachers and students, and in administrative activities for their
work activities.
In copyright and licensing, there is a percentage of undergraduate students (48%),
graduate students (41%), teachers (35%), contractors (39%) and administrators of
plant (35%) who understand that some content may be copyrighted and
Despite this, they use them without having any type of verification, placing themselves at a basic level,
It is necessary to intervene in this aspect to be clear about the importance of
recognize copyright and its proper use.
It stands out in the area of ​​security, that the university community participating in the
study, has built the ability to protect their digital devices and use strategies
such as the use of antivirus or passwords to reduce threats by locating in a
intermediate – advanced level, they also protect your personal data and identity
digital, in this last point, the University has carried out a campaign on treatment of
data which has allowed us to obtain these results. Although the vast majority understand
the health risks associated with the use of technology and take into account aspects
ergonomics and their addiction, there is a percentage of administrative workers (22%),
contractors (17%), teachers (21%), graduate students (16%) and undergraduate students
undergraduate (22%) who do not take measures regarding use.88
Regarding the problem solving area of ​​competence, as well as the previous point
It is highlighted that the majority of the participants in the study show an interest in bu scar
and resolve non-complex technical issues related to devices and environments
usual digital services, plant administrators were rated better in relation to
resolution of technical problems and identification of needs in responses
technological. On the other hand, there is a lower percentage of undergraduate students (22%),
graduate students (21%), teachers (20%), contractors (21%) and administrators (19%)
who require support and assistance when technologies do not work and it is important
improve the level so that they understand how to solve problems at a given moment.
According to the results in general, it can be said that this study was proposed
ending the year 2019 and the application of the instrument was carried out in May 2021, by
Therefore, the Manizales Headquarters had been in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic for more than a year
which gave it a digital boost and the activities stopped being face-to-face to
move to a virtual environment, it is thus that the university community autonomously
had to learn and obtain knowledge to face digital technologies and this
It is evident in the results of the study where the vast majority of the indices analyzed
They were valued at an intermediate level. Now, this qualification is only a reference and
does not indicate the quality of competencies that the University community has, since the
instrument was designed to generally evaluate each of the areas raised
by the DIGCOMP digital competence framework. Therefore, in order to improve the levels of
digital competence at the Manizales Headquarters, it is recommended to delve deeper into training
in the five areas of competence analyzed: information and information literacy,
communication and collaboration, creation and digital content, security and finally resolution
of problems, in order for those who are at a basic level to allow them to strengthen their
capabilities and can reach an intermediate level where they can apply the
knowledge and those at higher levels manage to improve their abilities
digital, allows them to propose strategies and participate in practice. According to Iorio 2019,
affirms that the digital transformation scenario imposes changes that do not allow anything
static, whether they are companies, people or societies. Everything must change. And especially
people and institutions must be open to unlearning and relearning
constant.89
4. Chapter 4. Development of the proposal
4.1 Situation to transform
Recognizing the digital resources and capabilities that an institution has is
essential to achieve its development, growth and sustainability. Have
mastery of competencies allows people to have the ability to create and
exchange digital content, communicate and collaborate, as well as provide solutions to
problems with a view to achieving effective and creative development in life, work and
activity social services in general (UNESCO, 2018), in addition, are essential to access
a range of opportunities in the 21st century. Digital capabilities must be updated
periodically to respond to the introduction of new technologies and their
impact on the digital economy and digital society (ITU Academy, 2018).
According to the study carried out by GAN & ANDI, 2021, the low qualification of workers
Colombians becomes a structural problem in times of economic crisis,
since they present a low level of adaptability to changes in the work environment on
all that generated by the COVID-19 pandemic. This restructuring of labor demand has
increased the search for people with strengths in digital skills as well as
in advanced socioemotional and cognitive skills (Fedesarrollo, 2021). Within
The profiles required by companies include soft skills, such as
conflict resolution, self-learning, teamwork, among others, which have
gained greater relevance by increasing the ability to adapt to new environments
labor by the workers (GAN & ANDI, 2021).90
The National University of Colombia in its digital transformation process has had to
adapt to changes caused by the global public health crisis with the pandemic
COVID-19, in the particular case the Manizales Headquarters has been forced to restructure
an accelerated way the development of teaching, research, extension,
as well as its administrative processes which gave a digital boost, and as mentioned
In the report of the previous chapter, the changes to which the
university community to learn about the management of digital technologies were seen
reflected in the results of the study where the vast majority of the analyzed indices are
evaluated at an intermediate level with the DIGCOMP model, however, being the
Pioneering university in education, it is important that the university community and in
especially teachers and students improve their skills to a higher level in such a way
so that they not only get involved in the application (intermediate level) but that they can have
the ability to propose, be critical and participate in practices at an advanced level.
It should be noted that the instrument used generally evaluated the areas of
digital capabilities, therefore, it cannot be said that the analysis has been developed
in a profound way and aspects such as the capabilities
advanced socioemotional and cognitive skills that have become more relevant during the
pandemic.
The University in its Digital Transformation 2030 project has identified thirty-five
(35) change factors which are listed in six (6) dimensions, when referring to
factors of change, refers to phenomena that can influence to generate changes
significant in the future (National University of Colombia, 2021), when reviewing the facts
of changes, it is detected that the areas of competence analyzed are directly related
with these factors (see table 21) and will be a fundamental element within the process of
digital transformation projected for the University. Likewise, at the Manizales Headquarters,
The Transformation Program project is currently being developed.
Organization which is carrying out a diagnosis of the current functioning of the
institution in order to guide the implementation of strategies to generate a proposal
prospective to the year 2034. The present study has allowed us to know the digital capabilities

contemplates the beginning of the application of digital transformation at Headquarters.91

According to the report presented in the previous chapter on the results of the
characterization of the digital capabilities of the UN Headquarters Manizales, it is proposed
present a digital skills training plan that serves as input to the
responsible for implementing policies derived from the Digital Transformation 2030 project
at Headquarters for the development of strategies that deepen the digital capabilities of
the university community and also allows working on the factors of change detected
in the Digital Transformation 2030 project.
4.2 Objectives
4.2.1 General objective
Strengthen the digital capabilities of the university community according to the areas
competency of the DIGCOMP competency framework.
4.2.2 Specific objectives

to teachers who are at a basic level.
3. Strengthen the knowledge of the university community to guarantee its application
in content creation.
4. Carry out training campaigns in relation to the area of ​​​​security competence to
the entire university community.
5. Provide support to the university community for the acquisition of
competencies in the area of ​​problem solving competence.93
4.3 Methodology
It is proposed to create a roadmap that has been proposed by (ITU Academy, 2018) as
a strategy to develop digital capabilities see figures 34 and 35.

training taking into account the objectives that were developed from the results
of the study. This table indicates the areas of competence to be strengthened, the subject, who
is directed and the interested parties, additionally, the current situation is shown by
competence and role taking into account the diagnosis of digital capabilities (A=Basic,
B=Intermediate, C=Advanced), also, it is expected that with the knowledge acquired in
training a percentage of progress is achieved (A= A-60%A, B=B-(60%B) + 60%A,
C=C+60%B) and the expected situation is indicated. Regarding the areas and the theme,
carried out based on the DIGICOMP 2.0 framework and Vargas Murillo, 2019.
This training plan does not take into account time or costs since they are variables that
you must adjust the instance that is going to execute this plan if it applies.95

5. Conclusions and recommendations
5.1 Conclusions
The study allowed us to examine the current state in relation to the levels of competence of
undergraduate students, graduate students, teachers, administrators and contractors
of the Manizales Headquarters and it was also possible to identify the aspects to improve, this will allow
have a starting point for the strategies to be developed with the project
UN 2030 Digital Transformation and respond to the intended change factors
front facing. Likewise, a training plan is proposed that indicates a roadmap to
continue to strengthen the digital capabilities of the university community Headquarters
Manizales.
It is concluded that the theoretical proposal and methodology proposed by the competence framework
DIGCOMP, its application in Higher Education Institutions is valid, in this case
a University of Colombia and it is considered that the application of
data collection and analysis instruments. Levels of measurement of results
It was made based on version 2.0 of the DIGCOMP framework, therefore the basic level was worked on,
intermediate and advanced.
As the result Cronbach's Alpha applied to the instrument obtained a very
close to 1, it can be concluded that in general it is highly reliable; Furthermore, it is a
highly favorable result to carry out a factor analysis to reduce
dimension. 90.8% of the variance of the empirical scores is due to the result105
of covariation between all the questions on the form, the remaining 9.2% is due to the
error variance. This allows the confidence interval to be used as a
excellent parameter for statistical credibility.
5.2 Recommendations
This research has potential, since from this it can be undertaken
studies in other Headquarters, comparative studies can be carried out with other Institutions
of Higher Education, whether public or private. Likewise, as a result of COVID-19, there is
not only the need to know digital capabilities but also the capabilities
socioemotional and cognitive that took on greater relevance in the pandemic.
It is recommended to promote the proposal raised in this study in such a way that and
can stimulate and strengthen the digital capabilities of the university community of the
Headquarters.106

ity to transform the educational model, allowing the adoption
of disruptive changes (Jiménez and de Andrés, 2022).
Under the direction of Rector Dolly Montoya, the University
National of Colombia (unal) has taken on the challenge of leading a
ambitious digital transformation project that covers all its
headquarters. This process involves organizational change driven by
the integration of digital technologies, with the aim of improving and
innovate in processes, which in turn requires a cultural change.
In addition, initiatives have been generated to undertake innovations
in pedagogical, research and project management fields
and processes, with the purpose of strengthening the relationship of the unal with
the territories os of the country and the world (Herrera and Pérez, 2023).
Una's mission goes beyond academic training; seeks
create upright, responsible and autonomous citizens, oriented to
be agents of change with ethical and social conscience. To achieve this, it is
crucial to contribute to national construction from wealth and fun
sity of the regions, promoting respect for difference and
social inclusion. In this context, Digital Transformation intersects

achievements of the missional objectives of the University.
Organizational Architecture Office
The organizational (business) architecture approach cannot be
seen as an issue that is only of the technological spring; in practice
tica, this concept is associated with a term that could be called
mine “strategic alignment”, understood as the process that
guarantees the integration of the different areas and projects of the
company, to achieve the objectives set at the organizational level.
This integration process can be approached from various perspectives.
spectives and levels, for example: 1) process integration (understanding
given as the coordination of business functions with management
operational, control and monitoring of business processes);
2) the integration that occurs between applications and information sources
mation (data models and databases); and 3) physical integration
(in terms of technological components: equipment, devices,
networks, among others). Some other approaches also consider the
business integration under a methodological approach that supports
institutional decision making, and from integration through
of business modeling (for example, through the use of
Reference frameworks and modeling of services and capabilities
of business).
The business alignment and integration approach is framed
mainly in the relationship that occurs between associated aspects
two between the Business and Technological Strategy, with the capabilities
operational (operational and technological). From a perspective
of Strategic Alignment, the following aspects are combined: 1)
those related to Business Strategy and Digital Strategy
/ Technological that, in an integrated way, enables alignment
business strategy; and 2) the alignment that occurs between
operational capabilities and technological capabilities. Both
aspects, operating in an articulated manner, enable a scenario

(National Directorate of Digital Strategy, 2022, p.22).
According to the conceptual model document of the architecture

National of Colombia must be assumed as a strategic capacity
tegic and as an endorsed reference to guide decision-making
on institutional development, driven by principles, which pro-

Happiness
A soft joy without words fills me
Today the soul that has never been sweeter and more serene...
I am on the earth, which gives me the beauty of it,
and I don't understand my hours of painful sadness!
Of the tall trees that line the road
The crystal of the trills falls in small pieces,
and the thin grasses that my plants smooth
They rise again to the voice of the breeze...
A shepherd who walks away through the steep mountain range,
tame the flock with his enchanted flute,
and the clouds that cross the blue of the skies
They have all the grace of small sailboats…
The roses show their freshness through the bars…
Blessed be the Hand that gives us so many things!
…If there are smiles that hurt like sharp daggers
There are others that clearly resemble lanterns,
and the phrase that sometimes mercilessly makes us bitter,
perhaps he has hidden a very long sorrow...
Let's imitate the life of traveling clouds
that are given to the generous, sincere winds,
and let's be happy, and let's be simple
like the sound of that good shepherd's flute...
Today the soul is filled with the soft sweetness
to feel, like water, the pleasure of being pure!

Abstract
Analysis of the degree of maturity of the digital transformation of an organization
Digital Transformation (DT) emerges as an incremental disruptive change process,
beginning with the adoption and use of digital technologies, then evolving towards a
deliberate holistic conversion of an organization in pursuit of value creation. However, this
path of transformation is not easy, so organizations need a roadmap through which to plan
and control said management, emerging TD maturity models as a tool for said functionality.
Under this need, a study was carried out in a Colombian organization, which addresses the
evaluation of its DT capacity, managing to identify how this process has developed from
the dimensions: strategy, tasks, culture, people, structure; to reach a new stage where
digital technologies are not limited to separate divisions, channels or functions, but are
used across the organization to support corporate strategies, based on the understanding
that an effective digital culture is an intentional effort and supported by its human talent.
The objective of this final master's degree project is  to analyze the degree of maturity of
the Digital Transformation of an organization. To achieve this objective, a mixed, non-
experimental and descriptive investigation was demonstrated in three stages: 1)
characterize the methods/ for measuring the maturity of DT in an organization based on a
Systematic Literature Review; 2) apply the most appropriate DT maturity measurement
method/model for the organization; and 3) propose recommendations to the organization
to improve its level of DT maturity. The main results are the analysis of the degree of
maturity of the TD of an organization and the recommendations to the entity to improve its
level of maturity of the TD based on the results of the application of the MMTD Aligning
The Organization for Its Digital Future of MIT Sloan Management Review and Deloitte.
Concluding that the progression in the degree of maturity of the TD of an organization is
directly related to the appropriation of the digital strategy within its strategic planning,
achieving an evolution from the traditional company to an intelligent structure, where the
investment is not focused only in the acquisition of technology if not in the change of
organizational paradigms towards a progressive business model with a perspective on the
digital future and culture of change.

The emergence and diffusion of radically new technologies have given rise to
technological revolutions that have drastically transformed societies and economies,
that create new leading industries and have a widespread impact on industries
existing, destroying some and rejuvenating others, that is, they are the main factor
generator of structural change (Epicoco, 2021; Freeman & Perez, 1988; C. Perez, 2010;
Schumpeter, 1939). Information and Communications Technologies (ICT)
emerged in the 1970s, and have been widely considered the core of the
transformation that is currently being experienced in the fourth industrial revolution (Archibugi, 2017;
Castells, 2010; Dosi & Virgillito, 2019; Gordon, 2013; Lee et al., 2018; Lundvall, 2017; c.
Perez, 2010; Carlota Perez, 2013; K. Schwab, 2017; Steinmueller, 2017; Tylecote, 2019)
According to N. Davis & O'Halloran, (2018) of the World Economic Forum, the fourth revolution
Industrial generates a world in which virtual and physical manufacturing systems cooperate
with each other in a flexible way throughout the planet. This allows for absolute customization
of the creation of new operating models and products through factories
intelligent (Smart Factory), revolutionizing the structuring of value chains
global (Schwab, 2016). Currently there is a transition in the dimensions
economic and social of a society hyperconnected to a digitalized world, in which
business, production and governance models of the traditional economy coexist
with those that emerge from the new technological paradigm and welcome its innovations.
Consolidating a new digitally interwoven system in which the
models from both worlds interact, giving rise to complex ecosystems that are
are in the process of regulatory, institutional and organizational adaptation, and in which the
Digital data achieves a strategic role as a source of economic value creation,
social and environmental (ECLAC, 2018, 2022a).
Digitalization as conversion and Digital Transformation as metamorphosis, where the

global, and in the course of change in society, and give rise to greater opportunities for
transmute and change legal and political measures, socioeconomic structures,
organizational patterns, cultural barriers, existing business models and
evolution of the paradigms of traditional industrialization and commercialization (N. Chen
et al., 2022; Collin et al., 2015 ; Guo et al., 2023; Heredia et al., 2022; Khan, 2017; Peng &
Tao, 2022; Zhai et al., 2022). This dynamic evolves according to technological advances,
because it is a synergistic and systemic process, in which advances in one area condition
changes in another, as well as for its potential to increase well-being, productivity and
environmental sustainability, where three dimensions of the economy are differentiated: connected,
digital and digitized (ECLAC, 2021, 2022a), see Figure 0-1.
These changes and their application in companies can generate resource savings, optimize
decision making and the possibility of predicting problems (Ashok et al., 2022; Motta et al.,
2019; Peng & Tao, 2022; Sewpersadh, 2023), and allow business models to innovate and,
At the same time, they trigger permutations in the value chain, with opportunities for
market, but also with challenges and competitive pressures that require constant
technological update (Alekseev et al., 2019; Gils & Weigand, 2020; Sewpersadh, 2023).
With positive impacts on the environment, in accordance with what is indicated by ECLAC (2021),
Digital technologies can contribute significantly to promoting the three
dimensions of sustainable development, stimulating growth, equality and
sustainability.

Problem Statement
According to authors such as Alkan, (2020); Cheng et al., (2023); Frank et al., (2019); Guo et al.,
(2023); Feng Li, (2020); Peng & Tao, (2022); Salume et al., (2021); Shahi & Sinha, (2021); and
Sousa et al., (2019), Romero et al., (2019) at the time of launching the Transformation
Digital in organizations does not take into account whether they are prepared to
carry out this process of metamorphosis from a strategic business philosophy that
internalize change and innovation, a sustainable economic situation and a culture
organizational acceptance of new technologies (Carrijo et al., 2021; Ghobakhloo &
Iranmanesh, 2021; Gils & Weigand, 2020; Heredia et al., 2022; Mihardjo et al., 2019;
Venkateswaran & Jyotishi, 2017), that is, initiating this disruptive and holistic process without
a clear objective, beyond acquiring new technologies that improve some operation
or that promote the idea of ​​being a company at the technological forefront affects the result
end of this management process, minimizing it to the purchase of new technology, which in
In many cases, it is not aligned with the reality of the company (Alkan, 2020; Calle et al.,
2020; Frank et al., 2019; Ghobakhloo & Fathi, 2019; Gileva et al., 2021; Gils & Weigand,
2020; Guo et al., 2023; Leonardus et al., 2018; Salume et al., 2021; Sousa et al., 2019).
The digital display offers facilities that do not go hand in hand with the actual operation of
many companies, which follow the precepts and paradigms from their culture
organizational and static and myopic management (Bordeleau & Felden, 2019; Feliciano-Cestero
et al., 2023; Guo et al., 2023; Nerima & Ralyté, 2021; Shahi & Sinha, 2021; Yamamoto, 2020).
And instead of getting performance and productivity improvements, they end up with acquisitions
high-cost technological technologies to continue with the same gaps that distance the organization
of competitiveness, optimization and effectiveness (Caputo et al., 2019; Carrijo et al., 2021;
Cheng et al., 2023; De Carolis et al., 2017; Gils & Weigand, 2020; Hanelt et al., 2021; Nerima
& Ralyté, 2021; Reyes et al., 2022; Salume et al., 2021; Sheng et al., 2022).
As digital investments increase, companies face a paradox of
digitization and cannot receive the corresponding return, but companies that
Properly performed digital investments can achieve good performance (Brozzi
et al., 2020; Cheng et al., 2023; Feliciano-Cestero et al., 2023; Mahraz et al., 2019; Shahi &
Sinha, 2021; Teubner, 2019). Due to the negative effects of Digital Transformation,
short-sighted managers may delay its implementation, while the effects
Positive results lead to excessive Digital Transformation (Cheng et al., 2023; Guo et al.,
2023). In this way, managerial myopia moderates the relationship between Digital Transformation4 Introduction
and company performance (Aghamiri et al., 2022; Guo et al., 2023; Heredia et al., 2022;
Sheng et al., 2022).
This situation is aggravated by not knowing the current organizational status or situation, without
be able to trace a path of progress and move incrementally towards a higher degree of
Digital Transformation maturity (Aghamiri et al., 2022; Brozzi et al., 2020; Frank et al.,
2019; Ismagilova et al., 2019; Reyes et al., 2022; Strutynska et al., 2020). Likewise, this
Ignorance of the level of maturity of Digital Transformation in organizations limits
its ability to progressively evolve in the development of key capabilities
to be successful in the new digital era (Cheng et al., 2023; Christensen et al., 2022; Gileva
et al., 2021; Haryanti et al., 2023; Ismagilova et al., 2019; Lorenzo Ochoa, 2016; Saleh &
Awny, 2020; Seyedghorban et al., 2020; Sousa-Zomer et al., 2020; Sousa et al., 2019; Usai
et al., 2021).
In summary, the problem that is addressed in this final master's thesis is that there is the
need for organizations to evaluate their processes to discover how they are
prepared for Digital Transformation and how to develop your roadmap, see Figure 0-2,
in accordance with the principle of the systemic approach of continuous improvement, where if they are not measured or
They evaluate the processes, there are no feedback processes1.
From the various problems indicated here, several research questions arise.
such as: How the organization's strategic planning should be designed for the
achievement of Digital Transformation? What is the appropriate route to follow for the
Transformation Digital? Why do organizations limit digital transformation to achieving
only digitize and/or digitization? What is the ideal situation for a company to
carry out the Digital Transformation? What factors and variables trigger the generation of
digital companies and their sustainability over time? What is the degree of maturity of the
Digital Transformation of an organization?, among others.
However, the research question addressed in this final master's thesis
is:
What is the degree of maturity of an organization's Digital Transformation?

In this argument of the identified problem, Colombia, although it has made progress in
consolidation of more proactive and efficient public entities, which appropriate and use the
Information and Communications Technologies (ICT) to provide better services to
citizens and optimally resolve their needs, from the Government Strategy6 Introduction
Online and with the deployment of the Digital Government Policy (PGD) since 2018
(MinTIC, 2022), according to the Digital Government Index, during the period 2018-2022
national entities have only managed to gain, on average, 8.5 points in the
implementation of the PGD. For their part, the territorial entities have advanced in
average 7.9 points in the implementation of the PGD (MinTIC, 2022). Even though the
Public Digital Transformation was established as a priority for the government in the Plan
National Development 2018-2022: Pact for Colombia, Pact for Equity, and in the
articles 147 and 148 of Law 1955 of 2019 (DNP, 2018; MinTIC, 2022).
With the update of the Digital Government Policy through Decree 1263 of 2022
(MinTIC, 2022), Colombia seeks to direct itself in achieving this objective, with this evolution
The PGD seeks to make a more digital State a reality. For this reason, for the country it is
Public Digital Transformation is essential to make a Colombia a reality
modern and competitive, understanding it as the process of exploitation of technologies
digital technologies that have the ability to create new ways of doing things in all
sectors of public administration, generating new development models, processes and
the creation of products and services, which in turn produce value, mainly through
of digitization that represents the conversion of data and analog processes towards
formats that can be understood and processed by machine inas (MinTIC, 2022).
Now, according to the objective of COPES 3975 to increase the generation of social value and
economic through the Digital Transformation of the public sector and the private sector,
through the reduction of barriers, the strengthening of human capital and the development of
enabling conditions, so that Colombia can take advantage of the opportunities and face
the challenges related to the fourth industrial revolution (DNP, 2019), the organization where
The Digital Transformation Maturity Model (MMTD) was applied as it was public in nature,

formulation and execution of policies, plans and programs to guarantee the right to
education, recognizes this objective and aligns it with the Digital Government Policy
and the National Development Plan 2023-2026: Colombia world power of life (DNP,
2023).
In this desire of the organization where the MMTD was applied to promote the use and
taking advantage of information and communications technologies to consolidate
a competitive, proactive, and innovative State and citizens that generate public valueIntroduction 7
in an environment of digital trust since its management (MinTIC, 2018), recognizes its need
to constantly evaluate your Digital Transformation process to identify
opportunities for improvement that will successfully lead to the achievement of this objective, and the
establishment of a roadmap that allows the planning of the process, its execution
controlled and measurable, the optimization of the resources that feed it and the obtaining of the
best possible results.
Goals
To answer the research question, the following objectives have been established:
General objective
Analyze the degree of maturity of an organization's Digital Transformation.
Specific objectives
❑ Characterize the methods, models for measuring the maturity of the Transformation
Digital from a literature review.
❑ Apply the method or model for measuring the maturity of Digital Transformation
more appropriate to the organization.
❑ Propose recommendations to the organization to improve its level of maturity of the
Digital Transformation based on the results of the application.
Design of the investigation
To achieve the proposed objectives, the development of a descriptive study was established,
since this type of study is aimed at measuring the presence,
characteristics or distribution of a phenomenon in an organization at a moment of cut
over time, limiting itself to describing one or several phenomena without the intention of establishing
causal relationships with other factors (Veiga de Cabo et al., 2008). In turn, it is considered
that there was no intentional manipulation, only the phenomena were observed as they were
gave in their natural context, the type d and research design of the final work
mastery was non-experimental, see Figure 0-3.8 Introduction
The research approach used in this final master's thesis was mixed, see
Figure 0-3, since quantitative and qualitative techniques were combined to obtain the
information necessary to respond to the objectives of the study (J. W. Creswell, 2014;
John W. Creswell & Creswell, 2018; Tashakkori & Teddlie, 2009). Consequently, for
To achieve the objectives, three phases were executed, namely: 1) Characterization of the Model of
Digital Transformation Maturity (MMTD), in which the
methods/models for measuring the degree of success in the strategic change process of
adoption and use of digital technologies based on a Systematic Literature Review
(RSL), and the MMTD to be applied in the organization under study was defined. 2) Estimate the level
of maturity of the Digital Transformation, through the application of the Maturity Model of
the Digital Transformation (MMTD) most suitable for the organization. And 3) Data analysis
obtained and recommendations, in which recommendations were generated to the organization
to improve your level of Digital Transformation maturity based on the results of
the application for each organizational dimension evaluated according to the selected MMTD.

planned and controlled in search of optimization of its performance, competitiveness,
evolution of its functional structures and the creation of new business models that
generate products or reformed organizational structures, based on results
by dimensions of analysis of the applied MMTD (strategy, tasks, culture, human talent
and structure). Likewise, it is worth highlighting that the defined methodology of the MMTD was enriched
selected by grouping the questions from your information collection tool
according to its dimensions, and add a gap analysis in which a state is defined
ideal and an objective state to then define opportunities for improvement.
This final master's thesis is structured in six chapters that I develop they call

Of art
This chapter aims to describe the key concepts, characteristics,
constructs, importance and impacts of Digital Transformation.
This chapter is made up of the following sections, a first that describes the method
of the Systematic Review of Literature (RSL) to obtain information and its
subsequent analysis. In the second section 1.2 the difference between
Digital Transformation and Digitalization from the change in strategic thinking
towards organizational competitiveness. The third section 1.3 focuses on the relationship
existing between Digital Transformation, strategic planning and the value chain. The
Digital Transformation in the Colombian context is shown in the fourth section 1.4. and
A summary of the chapter is provided in the fifth section 1.5.
1.1 Method
To achieve the proposed objective for this chapter, the Review method was used.
Systematics of Literature (RSL) proposed by Kitchenham et al., (2009) and expanded by
Galvis-Lista & Sánchez-Torres, (2014) and Sánchez-Torres & Miles, (2017) in which
define three stages: planning, information search and structuring of the
state of the art. The steps for each stage are in Figure 1-1.
1.1.1 Planning the information search
According to Galvis-Lista & Sánchez-Torres, (2014); Kitchenham et al. (2009) and
Sánchez-Torres & Miles, (2017) in the identification of search needs,
They established six guiding questions which are listed below:
1. What is Digital Transformation and digitization?12 Analysis of the degree of maturity of the Digital Transformation of an organization
2. What is the difference between Digital Transformation and digitization?
3. What is the relationship between strategic planning and Digital Transformation?
4. How are the value chain and Digital Transformation related?
5. What are the keys to success for Digital Transformation?
6. What is the panorama of Digital Transformation in Colombia?

Miles, 2017)
As quality criteria for the selection of studies related to Transformation
Digital were defined: 1) level of explanation of the topic offered by the study, 2) degree of
relationship with the topics of interest and 3) results and conclusions of the study, as well as the
bibliography used.
For the classification of studies related to Maturity Models of
Digital Transformation the quality criteria for the selection were: 1) the degree of
description of the model, 2) level of clarity and impartiality in obtaining, analyzing and
presentation of results, 3) if the study presents the method of application of the model and
4) model validation methods.Chapter 1 13
1.1.2 Search for information
In this stage, a search strategy was built iteratively with terms
associated with digital transformation, digitization and maturity models that was executed in
the Scopus database, limited between 2014 and 2023, see Table 1-1.

In the results obtained from the search, two filters were applied, the first, level of
reading 1, with analysis of the title, abstract, introduction and conclusions of each article. He
The second filter, reading level 2, included a more in-depth scrutiny of the
document in which its base theory, development, validation and results were analyzed. In
Both filters applied the previously defined quality criteria. In this way, it
they got 335 a articles in total, of which in a first level reading
They selected 79, to ultimately reduce the group to 55 documents in the reading
second level.
From the results of the RSL it can be seen in Table 1-2 that between 2014 and
2022, there are about 14,300 articles published and an annual growth of articles about
Digital Transformation. It stands out in 2022 that the articles published are more than
140 times that of 2014, see Table 1-2, and that of 2021 almost 113 times greater than at
of the year 2014 (Almasri et al., 2021; Mahraz et al., 2019). The above indicates the interest
growing in the generation of knowledge in this area and its appropriation at the level
business and social, in validation of what was stated by Gebayew et al. (2018). It becomes clear
that the articles found for 2023 were not taken into consideration because
They would only correspond to the scientific production of the first quarter of the year.14 Analysis of the degree of maturity of the Digital Transformation of an organization

The analysis by thematic area of ​​the articles obtained, as seen in Figure 1-2,
presents the different fields of application of digital transformation from 2014 to
2022, along with their percentage contribution by area (Almasri et al., 2021; Maedche et
al., 2017; Tiller, 2011). Where the field with the highest contribution percentage is the
of computer science corresponding to 22.8% and the lowest the field of
application of medicine with 2.4%.

regardless of its size and sector of activity. Beyond the
dematerialization of work processes, this approach allows companies

competitiveness through the adoption of a new management mode, new
tools, new working methods, but also new reflections and

and a strategic issue for all organizations. Offers new
opportunities for companies, beyond their traditional activities, to
accelerate its growth and create sustainable competitive advantages and security in
the operations. TD increases the company's profitability by simplifying
processes and interactions within the company.
Digital Transformation can be seen as a process of continuous adoption of
a digital landscape that changes significantly to meet the
(Teichert, 2019)
digital expectations of customers, employees and partners. This process of
Adoption must be actively designed, initiated and implemented.
TD requires workforce transformation. This involves changes in the
culture and capabilities. Information technologies (IT) can help
this process at different levels, depending on the degree to which the technology is used,
in three ways: respond to external pressures and demands with (Eden et al., 2019)
available resources and constraints; truly leverage IT to
change structure, roles and capabilities; and, rethink the profession and
need for a customer-centric orientation.

Digital Transformation is embedded in the fourth industrial revolution, (Nambisan et al., 2019)
also known as Industry 4.0. The digital revolution and platforms have (Dethine et al., 2020)
transformed businesses and provided immense opportunities for (Weking et al., 2020)
entrepreneurs, conceiving TD as a key term to express the (Sturgeon, 2021)
organizational changes influenced by digital technologies. (Bouncken & Barwinski, 2021)
The concept of Digital Transformation is usually adopted in relation to a wide
range of recently introduced enabling technologies, such as AI, internet
industrial things, big data and smart products. Furthermore, it involves

From this set of definitions presented in Table 1-3, the
characteristics, drivers, impacts and areas that are altered by
Digital Transformation. This is how the literature obtained by the RSL can be classified
according to the different authors in the matrix presented in Figure 1-3, which delimits the
concept of Digital Transformation through its fundamental elements, to make
possible its understanding and appropriation, and outlines it as a strategic element, process,
management element that affects the business model, paradigm shift or as a
improvement tool. At the same time, Digital Transformation is recognized for being radical,
disruptive, evolutionary and continuous, complex, multidimensional and holistic; driven by the
digital technologies and capabilities, strategic planning, business model,
value chain, the business performance to be achieved, and the management of the
innovation. Digital Transformation has an impact on value generation, efficiency
operational, competitive advantage, improving customer experience, innovation,
flexibility, internationalization (expansion in international markets) and
business productivity.
Derived from the above, Digital Transformation is understood, for this work

For its part, in accordance with the summary of concepts extracted from the RSL for digitalization,
presented in Table 1-4, where the authors agree that it is a process of change
from analog to digital that enhances the use of information and digital technologies.
Table 1-4: Definition of digitization
DIGITALIZATION
Definition Source
Digital technology takes information and breaks it down into its components
More smalls. By transforming an analog signal into discrete pieces, the
Digitization makes it possible to manipulate information, text, graphics, code (Maxwell & McCain, 1997)
software, audio and video in ways never thought possible, therefore, its capabilities
of information and transformation.
The transformation of existing sociotechnical structures that previously
were mediated by artifacts or non-digital relationships in structures that (Yoo et al., 2010)
are mediated by digitized artifacts and relationships with capabilities (Thorseng & Grisot, 2017)
recently integrated digital
Industrial management literature defines digitalization as the phenomenon of (Parida et al., 2015)
connected intelligent machines that enhance information and technologies (Lerch & Gotsch, 2015)
digital. (Lenka et al., 2017)
Digitization describes a change from "analog" to "digital" (for example, a
change from cash to electronic payments) and the simplification in the generation of
(Hagberg et al., 2016)
new forms of value creation (e.g. accessibility, availability and
transparency).
Digitalization is defined as the use of digital and data technologies to
generate revenue, improve business, replace/transform processes
(Clerck, 2017)
commercial and create an environment for digital business, in which information
Digital is at the center.
Digitization means the transformation of all types of information (text,
(Machekhina, 2017)
sound, images, video and other data from various sources) into digital language.
The action or process of digitizing/digitization; analog data conversion
(Parviainen et al., 2017)
(especially in images, videos and texts for later use r) in digital format
It is not the emergence of a new revolution, but the omnipresent synergy of the
(Valenduc & Vendramin, 2017)
digital innovations throughout the economy and society.
The digitalization of products and services minimizes the distances between
people and things, increases mobility, allows the use of information
particular that allows the satisfaction of the specific needs of each (Devereux & Vella, 2018)
client/stakeholders; It also enables extensive opportunities for (Crittenden et al., 2019)
innovation, investment and the creation of new companies and jobs,
becoming one of the main drivers of sustainable development.
The integration of the analog and digital worlds with new technologies that
improve customer interactions, data availability and (Eling & Lehmann, 2018)
business processes.
Digitalization is the growing application of ICT throughout the economy "that
encompasses a range of digital technologies, concepts and trends, such as
(Morley et al., 2018)
artificial intelligence, the Internet of Things (IoT) and the Fourth Revolution
Industrial.
Digitalization refers to the design and implementation of ICT systems
(Gebre-Mariam & Bygstad,
and the related organizational change, involves the change of structures

sociotechnical that were previously mediated by non-digital gadgets.
The way in which many domains of social life are restructured around
communication infrastructures and digital media. In simple terms, the (Srai & Lorentz, 2019)
Digitalization can be defined as the use of digital technologies.
It offers opportunities to reinvent and redefine business models and establish (Adner et al., 2019)
connected, aggregated and interactive models and processes. (Holmström et al., 2019)
Through digitalization, managers want to produce business values ​​of

customer-centric and stakeholder-oriented, and serve as a
efficient, compatible purchasing function without internal limits.
Digitization is the phenomenon of transforming analog data into language
digital (i.e., digitize/digitization), which, in turn, can improve
(Reis et al., 2020)
commercial relationships between the client and companies, and provides added value to
the entire economy and society.

Consequently, digitalization is understood in this final master's thesis as the
development and implementation of information technology (IT) systems and
concomitant organizational change, which transforms socio-technical structures
that were previously mediated by non-digital artifacts in others mediated by
digitized artifacts (Eling & Lehmann, 2018; Gebre-Mariam & Bygstad, 2019; Reis
et al., 2020).
1.2.2 What l is the difference between Digital Transformation and
digitization?
In the RSL there are authors such as Maltaverne (2017), Srai & Lorentz (2019),
Kääriäinen et al. (2021) and Wessel et al. (2021) that show the mixed and indistinct use
of the terms digitize (digitization), digitization and Digital Transformation, when the
difference between these is quite significant when considering their scale of impact on the
organization and the level of occurrence of change from one to another as shown in the
Figure 1-4. Then we have to digitize (digitization) is the material process of converting
analog flows of information in digital bits (Brennen & Kreiss, 2016), digitalization
refers to the technology of digitizing information, a simple automation, which
provides the appropriate information systems to operate the processes, and uses
digital technologies and data in order to generate income, improve business,
replace/transform processes and create an environment for digital business, where
digital information is the core, that is, it is the transformation enabled by IT
digital technologies and digitized information, to create the value of new forms of
processes (Clerck, 2017; Gobble, 2018; Parviainen et al., 2017; Reis et al., 2020; G.
Rodríguez-Abitia & Bribiesca-Correa, 2021; Wessel et al., 2021).
Ringenson et al. (2018) support these definitions and find them useful to highlight the
difference between the technological conditions necessary for related social change
digitally (digitize/digitization) and real change (digitalization). Regarding the 22 Analysis of the degree of maturity of the Digital Transformation of an organization
Digital Transformation, this is understood as an evolutionary process that takes advantage of the
digital capabilities and technology to enable business models, processes
operations and consumption experiences that generate value (Morakanyane et al., 2017;
Verhoef et al., 2021), a profound remodeling of the IT-based organization
(Demlehner & Laumer, 2020; Verhoef et al., 2021). At this point Wessel et al. (2021)
generates a parallel between Digital Transformation and IT-enabled transformation
or digitalization, as different but related concepts. Because both
address the effect of leveraging IT on the value proposition, but the IT approach
Digital Transformation is in its definition and is related to the creation of the
identity of a new organization, while IT-enabled transformation is
focuses on supporting it and is related to the improvement of an existing identity (Aghamiri et al.,
2022; Gobble, 2018; Wessel et al., 2021).
Figure 1-4: Definition of Digitalization, Digitization, and Digital Transformation
Source: Adapted from (Maltaverne, 2017)
In short, the distinction between the three terms is described as follows: digitization is
focuses on the generation of data or digital information alized with a low impact on the
process of transformation of the organization and change of the business model; the
Digitization focuses on the automation of processes that allow improvements in the
business model in a digital environment with a medium impact on the change of the
organization; and the Digital Transformation is heading into the disruptive process that
potentializes, at a high level, the change in the structuring of the organization and its
evolution towards an intelligent business. In this way, it is observed that through the
Digital Transformation: digitization and digitization are obtained, but not Chapter 1 23
contrary. And that, if these three are not well directed from the organization's strategy,
It can only end with a waste of resources.
1.3 Digital Transformation, strategic planning and
the value chain
1.3.1 What is the relationship between strategic planning and
Digital Transformation?
The coupling of technology with the global strategy of an organization must be a
latent reality in companies (Bellantuono et al., 2021; Escorsa & Valls, 2005; Jonathan
et al., 2021; Jonathan et al., 2023), with two paths to achieve this, through
integration of methods and technologies in the different areas of the organization, oriented
in a common strategic way; or through the germination of a technological strategy
merged into the global strategy, focused on fundamental production technologies,
with orientation towards the market in which the union of the efforts of
research and development with long-term needs (Mahraz et al., 2019; Núñez
de Schilling, 2011; Schwertner, 2017; Serinikli, 2020; Tortora et al., 2021).

rethink your strategy, your operations, your organizational culture and the way you
interact with their interest groups, to adapt to new behaviors of the
market, and take advantage of technological tools in terms of innovation,
productivity, and value generation at three different levels i) the experiences of the
customer, ii) business processes and iii) business models, see Figure 1-5 (Christensen
et al., 2022; Farías Gaytán et al., 2020; González-Varona et al., 2021; Hanelt et al., 2021;

new products, services and processes that lead to increased productivity and
optimizing their results (Appio et al., 2021; Babkin et al., 2020; Christensen et

1.3.2 How is the value chain and Transformation related?
Digital?
By intensifying the use and appropriation of digital technologies in organizations,
transform traditional business and production schemes into models of
Industry 4.0, where the latter are based on information technologies that
merge with traditional operation and production mechanisms, allowing
that the value chain, through continuous autonomous flows of information, generates
decisions and actions that enable more intelligent and flexible processes, see Figure 1-7
(Christensen et al., 2022; Delgosha et al., 2020; Hanelt et al., 2021; Heredia et al., 2022;
Maydanova & Ilin, 2019; Mihova & Chukalov, 2019; Verhovnik & Duh, 2021).

Heredia et al., (2022); Feng Li, (2020); Matt et al., (2015); and Seyedghorban et al., (2020),
must exist between four transformational dimensions: change in value creation,
structural change, use and appropriation of technology, and aspects financials, see Figure 1-8.

The dynamic and adaptive capabilities of organizations are expanded by
Digital Transformation, and helps companies perceive and use the changes of
its environment, see Figure 1-8, giving it the ability to perceive and predict these variations
for the generation of preventive measures and mitigation of negative effects, which
enhance the opportunities that favor organizations to reconfigure their
processes and resources to respond more quickly to crises (Aghamiri et al., 2022;Chapter 1 27

1.3.3 What are the keys to success for Transformation
Digital?
One of the main challenges that industrial companies now face is
define its transformation roadmap (Aghamiri et al., 2022; Bellantuono et al., 2021;
De Carolis et al., 2017; Heredia et al., 2022; Rozo et al., 2020). Without knowing where to go
leads the Digital Transformation, large amounts of time, money and
effort when carrying out a process that does not satisfy the needs of the organization and its
restrictions, leading it to a possible terminal crisis due to the underutilization of its
resources and the impossibility of evolving with a technology that is not in accordance with their reality
(AlMulhim, 2021; Caputo et al., 2019; Fujii-Takamoto & Langford, 2022; Gils & Weigand,
2020; Marjanovic et al., 2019; Maydanova & Ilin, 2019; Paritala et al., 2017; Saleh & Awny,
2020; Serinikli, 2020; Verhoef et al., 2021).
The Digital Transformation process must be designed and planned to obtain the
better performances and results that meet the needs of the system
organizational where it will be applied and its clients (Alkan, 2020; Brown & Brown, 2019; De
Carolis et al., 2017; Feliciano-Cestero et al., 2023; Gileva et al., 2021; Peng & Tao, 2022;
Salume et al., 2021; Yamamoto, 2020), as a result of a planning strategy
that evolves from technology surveillance and innovation management, see Figure 1-9;
to be implemented (Feliciano-Cestero et al., 2023; Saleh & Awny, 2020; Verhoef et al.,
2021), and to be able to refine it thanks to a continuous cycle where autonomous learning never
ends and becomes an essential part of the company's DNA (Feliciano-Cestero et al.,
2023; Ghobakhloo & Fathi, 2019; Gileva et al., 2021; Heredia et al., 2022; Kamalaldin et
al., 2020; Leonardus et al., 2018; F. Li, 2020; Manotti et al., 2020; Martín-Peña et al., 2019;

According to Wade & Shan, (2020) studies in the literature showed that the aggregate rate
of failure of Transformation projects n Digital was 87.5%, interpreted as no

1.4 Digital Transformation in context
Colombian
For the Colombian case, according to Sierra, (2022), the Transformation Survey
Digital of the National Association of Entrepreneurs of Colombia (ANDI) 2019 and 2021, and the
Global Survey of Presidents CEO Survey 2021 an analysis of the period is developed
2019 to 2021. For 2019, 30% of Colombian companies presented a
disadvantage in relation to the Digital Transformation and the fourth industrial revolution, alreadyChapter 1 29
that they did not have a strategy in this area (Velasco Chaves et al., 2020). And according to the
aspects that they consider key in their organizations are a process and channel of
digital marketing, and digital services or products (ANDI, 2019). In this line to
At the beginning of 2020, 65% of Colombian companies had an area and a budget
destined for Digital Transformation, which positioned Colombia among the last
countries in the region (Sierra, 2022). However, the vital need of
continue operating, turned the COVID-19 pandemic crisis into a
opportunity for growth, and promoted that at the end of 2020 the percentage would increase
by almost 80% (Sierra, 2022).
In the Digital Transformation Survey of the National Association of Entrepreneurs of
Colombia (ANDI) 2021, companies in Colombia considered that the most incentives
important to start a Digital Transformation are the use and appropriation of new
technologies, the development of new business models and customer expectations
(ANDI, 2022). Focusing on automating processes, reducing costs and achieving industries the
as investment objectives in Digital Transformation. Likewise, for 2021 41.05%
of the organizations tified the impact of investments made in technologies
emerging, by delimiting your digital strategy based on a clear objective and verifying the
performance of the resources applied in the results obtained. The companies
Colombians consider Digital Transformation as a disruptive process that
promotes development, supported by the fact that 91.04% of them perceive it as a
opportunity to raise talent skills in new technologies and how
instrument to face the challenges of the new reality (ANDI, 2022). With shape to
Previous, the results obtained in the Global Presidents CEO Survey 2021,
93% of participants envision expanding their investments in
Digital Transformation, motivated in large part by the crisis caused by COVID-19
(PwC Colombia & CINTEL, 2021).
Among the actions implemented to achieve Digital Transformation by the
Colombian companies are: 1) improving the connectivity of the platforms, 2) taking
of data-based decisions through analytical models, 3) the generation of
operational efficiencies by using technologies that improve the customer experience, 4) put
cost efficiencies initiatives are underway to optimize processes through the
definition of digital strategies and new business models, and 5) aligned innovation
with the business strategy supported by digital technologies as a driver of change30 Analysis of the degree of maturity of the Digital Transformation of an organization
(PwC Colombia & CINTEL, 2021), in accordance with what was found in the literature to
the potentialization of the Digital Transformation and that has been described in sections
previous.
1.5 Chapter summary
In this first chapter, an RSL was developed that answers the six questions
formulated guidelines that lead to the structuring of the state of the art of the present
final master's thesis, from the definition of Digital Transformation, its difference with
digitization, to then define the relationship it has with strategic planning,
innovation and the value chain, to finally have an overview in the context
Colombian.
The main result of the RSL is the concept of Digital Transformation,
understood as the use and appropriation of technology and digital data in a way
planned and controlled to radically improve the performance or scope of
companies, their competitiveness, the evolution of their functional structures and the
creation of new business models that generate products or structures
reformed organizational structures (Bertello et al., 2021; Cheng et al., 2023; Gils & Weigand,
2020; Mahraz et al., 2019; Pan et al., 2022; Westerman et al., 2014).
Likewise, it is observed that thanks to the RSL the concept of Transformation was analyzed
Digital, outlining it in its typology: strategy, process, business model, change of
paradigm and improvement tool; in their faces teristics: radical, disruptive,
evolutionary/continuous, complex and multidimensional/holistic; in its drivers:
digital technologies and capabilities, strategic planning, business model, chain
value, business performance and innovation management; and in its key impacts:
value creation, operational efficiency, competitive advantage, improvement of customer experience
customer, innovation, flexibility, internationalization and productivity, which lead to
companies to the transformation of customer experiences, the transformation of
business processes and the transformation of business models. With this chapter
partially achieves objective one of this final master's thesis. Chapter 2
2. Maturity Models
Digital Transformation:
Characterization, Analysis and
Selection
This chapter aims to characterize the maturity assessment models in
Digital Transformation to apply the most appropriate to the needs and characteristics
specific to the organization under study.
Consequently, the four main sections of this chapter are 2.1 in which
explains the method for the development of the chapter, 2.2 where the Models are characterized
of Digital Transformation Maturity (MMTD), 2.3 through which the
comparison of the MMTD and 2.4 in which the maturity models are analyzed for
finally select the most appropriate one for the organization.
2.1 Method
To achieve the objective of this chapter, three stages were established: the first followed the
RSL method described previously in section 1.1, a second stage of
characterization of the MMTD, and a third stage where the model of
maturity most appropriate to the organization under study, according to Figure 2-1.

2.1.1 Systematic literature review
At this stage, the method described in section 1.1 was applied to respond to the
guiding questions What is a maturity model? and what are the models of
existing digital transformation maturity?
2.1.2 Characterization of Maturity Models
Digital Transformation
To characterize the MMTDs with a standardized perspective, their
objectives, dimensions, variables, methods, indicators and classification levels of the
maturity, see
Figure 2-2. For this purpose, the Characterization Sheets of
MMTD, which are presented in Annex A. At the same time, the completeness of the
MMTD to evaluate if it was possible to replicate it in the organization of interest.

2.1.3 Selection of the Digital Transformation Maturity Model
For the selection of the MMTD, the following criteria and their respective scales were defined:
1) Quantity and quality of methodological information about it that is presented
in published studies, as a critical factor for selection. Here it is evaluated
the existence of complete information on the MMTD methodology: objectives,
dimensions, variables, methods, indicators, tools and levels of
maturity, and is rated zero (0): does not exist and one (1): exists.
2) Methodological clarity for the application of the MMTD model, evaluated according to
the description of the methodology for applying the model. The scale applies
according to the understanding offered by the methodology to be able to use
satisfactorily the MMTD, zero (0): described regularly, one (1): described
moderately and two (2): fully described.
3) Adaptation of the MMTD to the organization under study, that is, if the field
The base application of its design is similar to that of the reference entity of the
present final master's thesis. This criterion seeks to evaluate whether the field
application for which the MMTD was designed matches that of the organization
object of study. The field of action refers to the industry or type of34 Analysis of the degree of maturity of the Digital Transformation of an organization
organization and earns the maturity model a score of zero
(0): not suitable and one (1): suitable.
The selection criteria were applied at two levels; the first where the criterion was used
1), and the second level of selection in which criteria 2) and 3) were used to obtain
the MMTD that is going to be applied in the organization, see Figure 2-4.

of MMTD Characterization, which are presented in Annex A. If you have a
tie, it was defined that the MMTDs that have the same
scoring based on the previous selection procedure, but executed by a
set of experts on the subject; and subsequently a weighting of the
total scores generated by the group of experts for each MMTD, that is,
The assessment given by each expert in the three criteria will be added and then averaged.
based on the number of experts who participated in the qualification of each of the
MMTD in a tie.Chapter 2 35
The assessment of these criteria is presented in the Model Selection Matrix.
Digital Transformation Maturity (MMTD), see Table 2-3. In the total score column
The total values ​​of the classification are observed. Of the 20 MMTD shortlisted
according to criterion 1), six MMTDs were obtained with the highest score awarded by the
classification of criteria 2) and 3). These maturity models also showed a tie
each other.
In this case in which a tie was generated in the highest total scores awarded
According to the MMTD selection criteria, a second round was carried out
of analysis and selection of the MMTD with the highest scores based on the criteria
already established, and jointly with the experts of this master's work:
Director and Co-Director, and the organization's Digital Transformation representative,
due to their technical and professional knowledge on the subject and the entity.
Keep in mind that for the final selection of the MMTD, the grades awarded by
the experts (Director and Co-Director of the master's degree work and the representative in
TD of the organization where the chosen MMTD was applied), all identified with the acronym
EX (Expert), were averaged to have the total score.
These experts were selected for having the knowledge and expertise in the field
of Digital Transformation both at an academic and professional level, and on the
organization, by meeting the following characteristics:
❑ Have knowledge and training in areas related to Digital Transformation.
❑ Have expertise in the Digital Transformation process: planning,
execution, control and evaluation.
❑ Manage knowledge regarding Digital Transformation.
❑ Have knowledge of the organization where the chosen MMTD was applied and its
direction in matters of Digital Transformation.
2.2 Characterization of Maturity Models
Digital Transformation
The maturity of a topic refers to the state of being very advanced or developed.
for an east and is structured in a set of dimensions that together describe the
its entirety (Gollhardt et al., 2020). Thus, Maturity Models (MM) are36 Analysis of the degree of maturity of the Digital Transformation of an organization
a tool used to evaluate qualitative and quantitative capabilities, through
a series of sequential levels, which together form an anticipated logical path or
desired from an initial state to a final state of maturity (Carrijo et al., 2021;
Proença & Borbinha, 2016). The MMs, with their organized and systemic structure, allow
companies evaluate different aspects of the organization and compare their levels of
maturity with its competitors and with those who present the best practices of the
market, which makes it possible to develop action guides to reach the highest levels
high market maturity (Carrijo et al., 2021; Proença & Borbinha, 2016).
Along these lines, digital transformation maturity models (MMTD) help to
understand and structure the concept of digitalization (Carrijo et al., 2021), and provide
an estimate of the current capabilities and maturity of organizations and
general directions towards the desired level of maturity (De Carolis et al., 2017;
Schumacher et al., 2016; Roy Wend ler, 2012). The MMTD must consider the differences
of the industries and their stages of development, so that their diagnosis and classification of the
maturity level are related to the reality of the organization (Aghamiri et al., 2022;
Carrijo et al., 2021; Reyes et al., 2022), because the Digital Transformation has
different effects in different industries and those with customer orientation and relationship
Business-to-consumer (B2C) are affected by digitalization faster and much
more than those with Business-to-business (B2B) relationships (Carrijo et al., 2021;
Demlehner & Laumer, 2020).
The authors J. Becker et al., (2009); De Carolis et al., (2017); Nerima & Ralyté, (2021) and
Soares et al., (2021) define that MMTDs can serve three functionalities
different: i) Descriptive, those that analyze the level of maturity and the current objective of the
company, ii) Prescriptive, those that present guides for the company to achieve the
desired level of maturity, focuses on the relationships of the domain with performance and
indicates how to approach improving maturity to positively affect the value of the
business, and iii) Comparative, when comparing the current level with the market benchmarking
and the maturity levels of competitors. A model of this nature could compare
similar practices between organizations to compare maturity within different
industries. However, the MMTD may be descriptive by design, but may
develop a roadmap and present the consequences of its comparative application
(Gollhardt et al., 2020). Another classification of MMTDs is provided by Gollhardt et al., (2020),
who state that in general, two types of MMTD can be distinguished. The approachChapter 2 37
quite classically specifies individual maturity in the form of fixed levels, where the scale
Five levels is the most common. These fixed levels can be staggered or continuous.
And focus area maturity models, on the other hand, each criterion can have
disparate levels of maturity in terms of quantity and distance from each other (van Steenbergen
et al., 2010).
Based on the RSL, the following MMTDs were identified, recorded in Table 2-1,
governed by the five requirements for a valid measurement process: 1) Observation, 2)
Generalizability (statistical generalization), 3) Theory-based interpretation, 4)
Exploration and 5) Implication (M. Kane et al., 1999; M. T. Kane, 2006; T. Thordsen & Bick,
2021; Tristan Thordsen et al., 2020).

Figure 2-5 represents the 46 MMTDs on a timeline that provides an overview
overview of these models to continue with a brief description of their purposes. In
Annex A compiles the information considered relevant for each MMTD in
their respective characterization sheets. However, below is a
classification of MMTDs based on the details of the characterization carried out.
2.2.1 MMTD precursors
The first maturity model that appears in the selection and timeline, see Figure 2-5,
is the Industry Digitizatio n Index (Friedrich et al., 2011) that seeks to better understand what
industries in which markets are adopting and benefiting from digitalization
first and which are lagging behind, in addition to obtaining information on the factors
specific technological developments that allow certain markets and industries to advance more
quickly. The Digital Transformation Maturity (Roadmap for Billion-dollar
Organizations) (Westerman et al., 2011) investigates the ways in which large
traditional companies around the world manage Digital Transformation and
benefit from it, to understand how digital technology changes the business of
large leading firms, and finally propose the transformation framework to promote
a successful Digital Transformation.
The Digital Maturity Matrix or Maturity Model developed by the Center for
Digital Business from MIT (Massachusetts Institute of Technology) (Westerman et
al., 2012) compares digital practices around the world, identifies the components
essential aspects of digital maturity and examines the links between digital maturity and
financial performance. The Status of Digitalization (W. Becker et al., 2013) wants to obtain
a current opinion on the understanding and use of digitalization in terms of
information and communication technologies within medium-sized companies. He
Digital Maturity Model (Peyman et al., 2014; Schäfer et al., 2015) provides a metric
to assess digital maturity from the perspective of different stakeholders, and
establishes fields of development and specific optimization potentials in areasChapter 2 41
individual. This model thus creates the basis for the development of the roadmap and a model
reference for the sustainable development of digital excellence.
2.2.2 MMTD with an economic focus on Digital Transformation
With the Digital Quotient model (McKinsey Digital Quotient) (Catlin et al., 2015),
acquires a more precise understanding of the digitalization challenge faced by
companies and their digital performance, and points out four lessons: 1) Think carefully
in the strategy that is available; 2) Success depends on the ability to invest in
relevant digital capabilities that are well aligned with the strategy, and to do so
to scale; 3) While technical capabilities are crucial, a strong and adaptable culture
can help compensate for the lack of them; and 4) Align organizational structures,
talent development, funding mechanisms and key performance indicators (KPIs)
with the digital strategy they have chosen.
The Digital Transformation Index (Berger, 2015) that evaluates the digital maturity of sectors
and businesses, by measuring the ability of companies to obtain benefits from the
Digital Transformation, which requires skills and capabilities in four key areas: 1)
Identify and evaluate current developments and trends in the digital economy; 2) Get
possible efficiency gains in the mo existing commercial property; 3) Identify changes
disruptive in the company's own business model and, based on this, define new
Business models; and 4) Initiate a comprehensive change in the corporate culture to give the
necessary implementation steps.
2.2.3 MMTD focused on Industry 4.0
The Industry 4.0 Readiness Model for German Companies
(Lichtblau et al., 2015), the Maturity Model for Industry 4.0 Readiness and Maturity
(Schumacher et al., 2016), SIMMI 4.0 (Systems Integration Maturity Model
Industry 4.0) (Leyh et al., 2017, 2016), The Acatech Industrie 4.0 Maturity Index (Schuh
et al., 2017) and Industry 4.0 Readiness (Lichtblau & et al., 2017) examine the readiness
for Industry 4.0: the will and capacity of companies to implement the
ideas behind Industry 4.0., provide a means to establish the maturity stage
current Industry 4.0 situation of companies and identify concrete measures to help them
reach a higher stage of maturity but focused on maximizing benefits42 Analysis of the degree of maturity of the Digital Transformation of an organization
Economical, they allow companies to classify their IT systems environment with a
focus on the requirements of Industry 4.0, and seek to expand the technological focus
dominant of the maturity models developed by including organizational aspects,
evaluated from a technological, organizational and cultural perspective, focusing on the
business processes of companies.
In confirmation of this is the Digital Transformation Report (Schäfer et al.,
2015) aimed at classifying organizations into five levels of digital transformation
according to the dimensions: strategy, leadership, products, operations, culture, people,
government and technology; the Model of Digital Maturity (Hellge et al., 2019) whose measurement of
Maturity provides basic knowledge about the situation of medium-sized companies
of the area of ​​influence regarding the implementation of technological measures or
support for digitalization.
Stages in Digital Business Transformation (Berghaus & Back, 2016), Digital Maturity
& Transformation Report (Berghaus et al., 2016) and Digital Maturity Model (Berghaus et al., 2016)
al., 2017) present the dimensions with which the Digital Transformation affects the
organization and develop the stages of maturity based on empirical data, in order to
derive a typical transformation path; but the second expands his analysis with the
evaluation of the success rating according to the level of maturity, which is why they affirm that the
companies with a higher level of maturity rate themselves as significantly more satisfied
on all success criteria than companies with a lower maturity level. These
Models serve as an instrument to determine the current position and discover differences
internal in the perception, and the comparison with other companies in the same sector as well
they are useful to plan the next steps in Digital Transformation.
2.2.4 MMTD focused on digital capabilities
Forrester’s Digital Maturity Model 4.0 (Gill & VanBoskirk, 2016) values ​​capabilities,
basic attitudes and competencies that define a mature digital operation, adapting
to three scenarios: General Digital Transformation, the model evaluates the aspects
fundamentals that are important for the overall Digital Transformation of a
business, such as executive support for digital strategy, digital staffing,
how success and business functions/effectiveness of the IT relationship are measured; approach
to digital marketing, the model also reviews the specific capabilities of the Chapter 2 43 function
a company's digital marketing, such as how well digital supports the marketing strategy
brand; and focus on digital business, the model further evaluates how digital supports
sales and service interactions, including touchpoint integration and
technological sophistication. Jointly, Open digital maturity model (ODMM)
Roads, 2017) arises to measure the maturity of the digital capabilities of companies
from the definition of the gap between the company's digital commercial ideals
and your current digital maturity level, to develop a viable plan for transformation
digital, allowing them to point the direction of their transformation efforts
digital.
2.2.5 MMTD developed according to industrial particularity or
sectorial
The following models are developed from a specific industry or sector, the
Digital Maturity Model for Telecom Ericsson
Telecommunications Companies) (Valdez-de-Leon, 2016) offers a vision
structured approach to Digital Transformation that is specific to the context and challenges
of the telecommunications industry and that can be used as a standard to help
communications service providers to compare themselves with their peers or with themselves
themselves as they advance in their transformation. The Maturity Model of Technology
Adoption in an Educational Organization (MMEO) (Dirk Ifenthaler & Egloffstein, 2020)
is an evaluation tool that allows a self-assessment for management and
Digital Transformation personnel in educational organizations.
The Digital Readiness Index (DRI) (Agostino & Costantini, 2021) aims to
assess the level of Digital Transformation of an organization as a whole, and take the
museum field as an exemplary application case. The Measurement Instrument
for Multidimensional Integrated Model of Digital Transformation (G. Rodríguez-Abitia
& Bribiesca-Correa, 2021) provides a mechanism to evaluate in institutions of
higher education the state of the Digital Transformation and suggest the steps to follow to
evolve in the transformation model, and identifies the elements that must
be addressed to evolve and improve the pr occident. However, items can be
customize for particular contexts, in terms of industry, size or other
environmental differences to better adapt to the needs of organizations
under evaluation. The New Digital Maturity Model for B2B Project Sales (Voss et al.,44 Analysis of the degree of maturity of the Digital Transformation of an organization
2023) model that has been developed in the B2B context to support decisions
appropriate strategies for Digital Transformation, based on an analysis of the state
current of the company.
2.2.6 MMTDs developed for application without distension
industrial or sectoral
In contrast to these models, The Digital Readiness Assessment (DRA) (KPMG, 2016;
Wallner & KPMG, 2016) offers a valid and tailored instrument to any
company for a rapid and effective implementation of the Digital Transformation.
The DRA can be used in all phases of the Digital Transformation and makes your
progress is measurable; The Digital Transformation Playbook (Rogers, 2016) focuses
into practical tools and frameworks that organizations can apply to make
decisions and formulate strategies for your own business, regardless of its size or
industry. Its goal is for organizations to discover the next stage of creation
of value and growth for your business; The Digital Culture Model Developed
(Lorenzo Ochoa, 2016) configures and explains the digital culture of any organization through
3 dimensions: 1) experimentation, 2) development and deployment, and 3) leadership and
transformation, with the aim of transforming the business model or models
organizational processes to create value for customers, employees and shareholders, and the
Digital Maturity in Traditional Industries (Remane et al., 2017) proposes two scales for
describe the digital maturity of a company: first, the impact that the
digital transformation in a specific company; Secondly, the preparation of the
company to master the changes that are coming. And verify the usefulness of this measure
of two scales by empirically deriving five groups or clusters of digital maturity.
The Organizational Agility Maturity Model (Gunsberg et al., 2018) and the Company
Readiness Evaluation for Digital Business Transformation (Isaev et al., 2018) are
models that provide a solution to the problem of evaluating the preparation of the
IT department for digital business transformation through the development of
a quantitative assessment of the maturity level of the IT department's processes
to meet the needs of the company, the first is, specifically, a model
benchmark required to measure the agility of the entire organization within a
information services division based on the Agility Maturity Model
Wendler's Organizational Analysis (R. Wendler, 2014). Chapter 2 45
2.2.7 MMTD aimed at comparing mature companies
digitally with what not and define key success factors
Aligning the Organization for Its Digital Future (G. C. Kane et al., 2016) is aimed at
discover how digitally maturing companies adopt Digital Transformation
and what distinguishes them, and analyze the nature of the gap between companies that mature
digitally and early-stage companies, and how companies mature
They continue to move forward. The Digital Future Readiness Transformation Model
(Schlaepfer et al., 2017) also aligns with this direction since it reflects the
level of preparation of industrial and consumer companies for the digital future and
focuses on the extent to which the manufacturing location is suitable for the digital age, the
key skills that digitalization requires and the transformations that will be
essential for companies that wish to position themselves as prepared for the future.
Likewise, the Maturity Model for Assessing The Digital Readiness of Manufacturing
Companies (DREAMY) (De Carolis et al., 2017) focuses on answering the question:
Are manufacturing companies ready to go digital? By offering a tool
to answer it using a maturity assessment method to measure the
digital readiness of manufacturing companies based on inspiring principles
of the CMMI (Capability Maturity Model Integration) framework. The transformation of the sector
manufacturing towards Industry 4.0 sets the stage for a great industrial change,
According to this panorama, the Maturity assessment for industry 4.0 (Colli et al., 2018)
provides a new digital maturity assessment approach, Digital Maturity Assessment
360, which is based on the problem-based learning (PBL) model, and responds to
a need to accompany various companies in their digital transformation in accordance
with its specific context.
2.2.8 MMTD that manage a gap analysis based on the
current state and the ideal
The Action Fields of Digital Transforming model (Peter, 2017) can be used to
evaluate the state and potential of the Transformation based on the consideration that
four dimensions that are essential for the business transition to the digital era:
1) Identify the needs of tomorrow's (digital) customers, 2) The development of
(digital) business options for tomorrow based on this knowledge, 3) The
implementation of these new business options, and 4) Organizational integration and 46 Analysis of the degree of maturity of the Digital Transformation of an organization
the use of these new business options. The Formative Measurement model
Model for Digital Maturity (Rossmann, 2018) conceptualizes and measures digital maturity
focused on three research questions: 1) How is the
digital maturity construct? 2) What capabilities are incorporated in the concept of
digital maturity?, and 3) How can companies measure digital maturity? Aligned and complementary with the 4 dimensions mentioned. Consequently, the Digital
Maturity Model (from TM Forum) (Deloitte, 2018; Newman, 2017) and the Deloitte Digital
Maturity Model (Anderson & William, 2018) are used to provide a snapshot
of the business, identify possible investment priorities and manage the journey itself,
step by step towards Digital Transformation and allow business leaders to
assess where they are on their transformation journey, create goals and plans, both
in the short and long term, and make positive impact investments for this.
In the Colombian case, the Maturity Model for Digital Transformation emerges
MINTIC – INNPULSA Colombia (Acevedo, 2018) that measures the degree of adoption
technological, and creates a new one related to the organizational capacity to manage
the transformation, which is presented in the model with the incorporation of the elements
soft, called enablers, which are transversal conditions to develop
digitization;
2.2.9 MMTDs designed with reference framework approach
As a framework of reference, we have the Structuring Digital Transformation Framework
(Gimpel et al., 2018) which is a holistic framework of fields of action for the
Digital Transformation that leads to reasoning about it in a structured way. And not
only provides information about the Digital Transformation in the organization, but also
also highlights some general implications for strategic planning and takes
of decisions. The Digital Transformation Framework for the State (MinTIC, 2020) that
enables the empowerment of public entities to push their
Digital Transformation, through the reinvention of processes, products or services,
to ensure the generation of public value; It also delivers to the entities the
measurement tool for your Digital Transformation, for prioritizing initiatives
of public entities in this area. And Strategic Factors Enabling Digital Maturity
(Salviotti et al., 2019) is a conceptual basis and a measurement scale defined for the
digital maturity, and establishes the relationship between digital maturity and the key factors of Chapter 2 47
Digital Transformation. With the perception that organizations must adapt to the
rapid advances in the digital environment and shift your focus from Digital Transformation to
digital maturity.
2.2.10 MMTD with maturity as an independent dimension
The Industry 4.0 Readiness Framework (Ambrosio da Silva et al., 2021) is designed under the
approach, in which maturity is understood as an independent dimension among the
two other dimensions, organizational facilitators and technological facilitators, and
shows how prepared a company is to participate in an Industry environment
4.0. The 3D-CUBE Readiness Model For Industry 4.0 (Felippes et al., 2022) also seeks
evaluate the current state of manufacturing companies in the context of the
Digital Transformation under 3 dimensions (X = Organizational Enabler, Y = Enabler
Technological, and Z = Process Maturity Enabler)
2.2.11 MMTD designed under the determination model
capability and software process improvement
The Digital Transformation Capability Maturity Model (DX-CMM) (Gökalp & Martinez,
2021) was developed under a holistic and integrated approach applicable in all sectors,
based on a well-established process capability maturity model,
determination of capacity and improvement of software processes (Software Process
Improvement And Capability Determination Model SPICE) and aims to optimize
the Digital Transformation competencies of the organization in a structured way as
consequence of the assessment of the existing level of capacity/maturity, and provide
a comprehensive roadmap for improvement. Another model that is based on
capacity determination and software process improvement model (Software
Process Improvement And Capability Determination Model SPICE) is The DX–Self
Assessment Maturity Model (DX-SAMM) (Haryanti et al., 2023) is designed to guide
to organizations by providing a broad roadmap to improve maturity
digital. With the development of maturity measurement, DX-SAMM contributes to the
sustainability of the organization by proposing Digital Transformation strategies for the future
based on current maturity achievements.48 Analysis of the degree of maturity of the Digital Transformation of an organization
2.3 Comparison of Maturity Models
Digital Transformation
Table 2-2 presents the dimensions and method of calculating maturity for each
MMTD being the two most representative characteristics when describing them: the
first to determine what is going to be evaluated and analyzed in the model, and the second to indicate
the procedure for its application and obtaining the maturity level. Of the 46 MMTD, 26
were marked in pink, because they did not have the definition of their method of calculating
maturity of Digital Transformation in the articles corresponding to its publication.
In relation to the evaluation dimensions, although the MMTD names them differently
different ways, the majority was classified into the 16 groups in Table 2-2. The
dimensions Strategy, Operations / Processes / Tasks, Culture, People / Talent
Human, Technology and Organization / Structure are the ones with the highest percentage
of use among the MMTD.49 Analysis of the degree of maturity of the Digital Transformation of an organization

2.5 Chapter summary
As a result of this chapter, the 46 methods, measurement models were characterized
of the maturity of the Digital Transformation identified from the RSL, to comply with
specific objective one. Based on this characterization, it was possible to know
particularities of the MMTD that allowed a study of the models of
maturity by dimensions and method of calculating maturity and classify them as
sample below:
❑ MMTD precursors
❑ MMTD with an economic focus on Digital Transformation
❑ MMTD focused on Industry 4.0
❑ MMTD focused on digital capabilities
❑ MMTD developed according to industrial or sectoral particularity
❑ MMTD developed for application without industrial or sectoral detention
❑ MMTD aimed at comparing digitally mature companies with those that are
no and define key success factors
❑ MMTD that manage a gap analysis based on the current state and the ideal
❑ MMTDs designed with reference framework approach
❑ MMTD with maturity as an independent dimension
❑ MMTD designed under the SPICE model
The maturity model selection process resulted in the choice of the model
Aligning The Organization for Its Digital Future by G. C. Kane et al. (2016) to be
applied in measuring the maturity of the Digital Transformation.3. Aligning The Model
Organization for Its Digital Future
The objective of this chapter is to describe, on the one hand, the Maturity Model of
Digital Transformation (MMTD) selected and on the other, the settings made for its
subsequent application in the organization under study.
Therefore, the chapter has section 3.1 in which the dimensions are presented,
maturity levels and questionnaire structure of the selected MMTD, section 3.2
showing the adjustment made to the MMTD selected to apply and section 3.3 with the
chapter summary.
3.1 Digital Transformation Maturity Model
Aligning The Organization for Its Digital Future
To understand the challenges and opportunities associated with using social business
and digital, MIT Sloan Management Review, in collaboration with Deloitte, developed a
annual survey of executives, managers and business analysts from organizations across
the world, which gave way to MMTD Aligning The Organization for Its Digital Future by G.
C. Kane et al. (2016), focused on carrying out measurements such as:
❑ Digital maturity level of the organization.
❑ Anticipate the interruption.
❑ Prepare properly.
❑ The biggest threat your company faces as a result of the digital trend.
❑ Percentage of professionals who want to leave their organization in less than a year
given digital trends.
❑ Most important technology for the organization today.66 Analysis of the degree of maturity of the Digital Transformation of an organization ion
❑ The organization's digital strategy is early, developing or mature
(Percentage of respondents who agree/strongly agree).
❑ Rating of the company culture (on a scale of 1 to 5).
❑ How companies strengthen their digital innovation capabilities.
❑ Most important skill an organizational leader must have to be successful
in a digital workplace.
❑ Talent needs vs. attraction capacity.
3.1.1 Dimensions of Digital Transformation maturity
To navigate the complexity of digital business, companies must adopt the
that G. C. Kane et al. (2016) called digital congruence, culture, people, structure
and tasks aligned with each other so that executives can effectively address the
challenges of a constantly changing digital landscape.
Culture: Accept risk
Getting an organization to accept risk goes beyond warnings that
taking risks is acceptable. Organizations that mature digitally incorporate
risk taking into the fabric of how they manage (G. C. Kane et al., 2016).
People: Deepening the Company's Skills
Companies that mature digitally are more than five times more likely
to provide employees with opportunities to develop digital skills
necessary than early-stage companies. Early stage companies,
On the contrary, they depend on consultants and contractors. Although this may be a means
excellent at supporting efforts from the beginning, relying solely on help
external should only be a provisional measure (G. C. Kane et al., 2016).
The talent shortage will continue to grow, and employees and executives who do not feel
Those who acquire digital skills will look for this elsewhere. Therefore, the
Digitally maturing organizations do more than offer training courses.
With the increasing pressure to perform and the accelerated pace of change brought about by
digital technology, the most powerful way to learn is not to access what others
people already know, but rather encourage the creation of new knowledge through Chapter 3 67
practice in the workplace itself, rather than in a training room (G. C. Kane et
al., 2016).
Figure 3-1: Digital Congruence: Digital Transformation Maturity Dimensions

Structure: Adaptive and agile
Hierarchical leadership structures were designed for complex organizations
in more stable times. To become more agile and foster collaboration, some
Large organizations simplify their structures and turn to cross-functional teams
to become more agile and let formal structures fade into a
background or disappear completely. This is accompanied by the fact that leaders can
establish high-level guidelines that can then be applied by local units and functions
to adapt ideas to your problems more and needs (G. C. Kane et al., 2016).
Tasks: Contingent Workforces and Customized Work
The complex and lengthy selection and background check processes
permanent and temporary jobs will not be able to keep up with all the needs
of talent in rapidly changing environments. Often the best talent is not
located within the four walls of an organization, and not everyone looks for fixes68 Analysis of the degree of maturity of the Digital Transformation of an organization
traditional employment. A growing field of companies are adapting to these
trends and provide access to selected independent talent who are
accessed as a service that connects and plays with the work of the organization and the
hiring processes (G. C. Kane et al., 2016).
The challenge is having the right person with the right skills in the right place.
at the appropriate time that allows the effectiveness of the organization. Here they come to play
factors of work organization in accordance with the capabilities of the company, which
meet your specific needs supported by suitable human talent and
eliminating unnecessary activities within processes and procedures (G. C. Kane
et al., 2016).
Strategy: Leading into the future
Evolving to compete in an increasingly digital world is not just about
implement more and better technologies. It involves aligning the company's organization with
the demands of the digital environment by increasing risk appetite, investing in
digital opportunities for your employees, optimize organizational structures
to achieve agility and rethink how and by whom work is done. Only when these factors
Organizational organizations come together, the company can go from being digital to being transformed
digitally. However, as these factors are not aligned, the efforts of
Digitalization can do little to improve a company's ability to compete
in a digital world, even if the technology investment and implementation are correct
(G. C. Kane et al., 2016).
Nadler & Tushman (1980) spearheaded the idea of ​​organizational congruence as
main ingredient for optimal corporate performance. The concept is that only
when the essential components of a business (its culture, people, structure and
tasks) are closely aligned, the company can achieve powerful results (G.
C. Kane et al., 2016). In an ever-changing digital landscape, the concept of
Congruence takes on a new meaning and relevance, since many companies do not

that does not favor the integration of your digital strategy with that of the business. Chapter 3 69
3.1.2 Digital Transformation Maturity Levels
G.C. Kane et al. (2016) defined three levels of Digital Transformation maturity:
early (1-3), developing (4-6) and maturing (7-10), with based on a scale of
rating from 1 to 10 in which it is evaluated that both the company is considered as a
ideal organization transformed by digital technologies and capabilities that improve
processes, attract talent across the organization and drive new business models
that generate value; where 1 (Not close) means that the study company is not for
nothing or very little similar to this ideal organization, and 10 (Very close) that the company
study is very similar or equal to this ideal organization, see Figure 3-2.
In more detail about the maturity levels for this model, it is considered that the
Digitally maturing companies closely link their digital strategies
with the overall strategy of their company and also have a longer-term vision of
strategy compared to early-stage companies (G. C. Kane et al., 2016).
Regarding culture, there are three different mentalities that are closely related.
with the stages of digital maturity. The first mentality is common among
early-stage digital organizations and is characterized by a low appetite for risk,
a hierarchical leadership structure, work done in silos, and decisions based more
in instinct than in data. On the contrary, the cultural mentalities that
relate closely to companies that mature digitally value the
experimentation and speed, accept risk and create leadership structures
distributed. Additionally, they encourage collaboration and are more likely to use data in the
decision making. In the middle are the cultures on the way from the first group to the third
(G. C. Kane et al., 2016).
Talent development is an important element of the culture in organizations that
mature digitally, who place a decisive emphasis on developing existing talent
and recruit new talent while early-stage companies are more likely to
resort to contractors and consultants (G. C. Kane et al., 2016). Companies that mature
digitally are significantly more capable of attracting new talent based on
their use of digital in contrast to early-stage organizations, which tend to
rely on external parties to support your digital efforts. As a result, it generates a
Talent gap for early-stage companies. Although these companies need
digital talent to help them advance digitally, their lack of progress restricts their
ability to attract that talent (G. C. Kane et al., 2016).70 Analysis of the degree of maturity of the Digital Transformation of an organization

Digitally maturing organizations provide the resources and opportunities
so your employees thrive in a digital environment. When developing employees for the
success in digital environments, business leaders are placing more emphasis on skills
of change than in technological knowledge (G. C. Kane et al., 2016).
Digitally maturing companies also value leadership. Knowledge
Technology is not the most important skill that leaders must have, the ability to
leading a company through business model change is the most
important, and being a forward-thinking progressive is almost as important with
a clear vision, solid strategy and foresight, according to G. C. Kane et al. (2016).
3.1.3 Structure of the Maturity Model questionnaire
Digital Transformation
The Maturity Model Quiz Aligning The Organization for Its Digital Future
by G. C. Kane et al. (2016) in English contains 34 questions regarding
Digital Transformation and 12 questions on demographics and characterization of the organization,
which are designed to obtain trends by industrial sectors.Chapter 3 71
In the MMTD Characterization Sheet in Annex A Table 6-18 there is information
additional information on the maturity model.
3.2 Adjustment of the Maturity Model
Digital Transformation Aligning The
Organization for Its Digital Future
The questionnaire described in section 3.1.3 was adjusted in Spanish language
Latin American and the same 34 content questions were maintained, but
They reduced the demographic classification and characterization questions to 5, because
those that aim to outline the comparison between types of
companies and sectors. Likewise, the terms of company by entity were changed,
industry by sector, partners by allies, business models by business models between
others, and the people dimension to human talent to seek more clarity and understanding
for the population to be surveyed, see Figure 3-3.

and information collection.
Another crucial modification that was made to the original questionnaire was to group the 34
questions according to the dimension of the MMTD to which they refer: strategy,
tasks, culture, human talent and structure, see
Figure 3-4. Since we wanted to have a simpler analysis of the tabulated information and
be able to design recommendations according to the organization that strengthen each dimension
delimited by the MMTD to achieve success in the Transformation process

4.4 Chapter summary
As observed throughout the construction of chapter 4, it is possible to apply the method or
Digital Transformation maturity measurement model most appropriate to the
organization through the adaptation and development of the Maturity Model of Chapter 4 89
Digital Transformation (MMTD) selected Aligning The Organization for Its Digital
Future by G. C. Kane et al. (2016), and their final adjusted questionnaire or the Survey
Digital Business Executives: Aligning the organization for its digital future. The
which consists of 39 questions in total adapted from the original MMTD questionnaire
selected, according to compliance with the organization under study, in Table 6-47
Annex B contains the questions from the original questionnaire and the changes made.
And it was answered by 29% of the entity's summoned officials.
The tabulation of the results is contained in Annex C in Figure 6-1 for each
ask. Based on these results, the analysis will be executed to design
recommendations for improvement and achievement of your goal in the Transformation process
Digital, and it was defined that the level of maturity of the Digital Transformation of the organization
object of study is under development. It is remarkable to say that the 34
questions according to the dimension of the chosen MMTD: strategy, tasks, culture,
human talent and structure so that the analysis can be carried out more simply and
correct.5. Recommendations for improvement
the maturity level of
Digital Transformation of the
organization under study
This chapter aims to propose recommendations to the organization to
improve your level of Digital Transformation maturity based on the results of the
application.
Derived from this, the chapter is composed of section 5.1 that establishes the method
followed p For the construction of the chapter, section 5.2 Ideal State in Transformation
Digital that was defined based on documentary analysis and interviews with the
representative in TD of the organization, 5.3 Gap analysis where the
improvement opportunities to reach a level of Digital Transformation maturity
high and in accordance with the organization's digital strategy and 5.4 Recommendations by
MMTD dimensions designed based on the gaps found in the comparison
of the current state (ASIS) and desired state (TOBE) of the organization in Digital Transformation
for each dimension of the MMTD.
5.1 Method
To design the recommendations and give the model the functionality of being
Prescriptive, which was discussed in section 2.2, was based on the architecture of the
two-axis roadmap of GipuzKoa Berritzen - Innobasque (2011), which the
Vertical Axis reflects aspects or perspectives that are going to be analyzed, and the Horizontal Axis
determines the horizon sections that will be considered in the reflection. The sections
standard are three: short, medium, and long term, see Figure 5-1.Chapter 5 91
Figure 5-1: Guidelines for roadmapping based on the MMTD dimensions
Source: Own elaboration based on (GipuzKoa Berritzen - Innobasque, 2011)
With this roadmapping technique, a common vision of the
strategy shared by different stakeholders to reach the ideal state
desired and develop a perspective on each layer of the roadmap (vertical axis),
focusing on the three basic questions that we want to answer (see Figure 5-1). The
final roadmap will reflect the path to follow from where you are today (state
current or ASIS for its acronym in English) to the long-term future vision that is sought
build (ideal state or TOBE for its acronym in English), where the milestones that are
aim to achieve in each of the perspectives in a horizon divided into 3 sections
different.
In this way, the design of recommendations was generated in three stages: 1) it was established
a current state of the organization in Digital Transformation or ASIS-TD based on the
information obtained with the application of the selected MMTD, said ASIS-TD is
It is recorded in chapter 4 section 4.3; 2) the ideal state of the
organization in Digital Transformation or TOBE-TD based on documentary analysis
(PETIC, process, procedures, regulations, strategic planning, etc.) and interviews92 Analysis of the degree of maturity of the Digital Transformation of an organization
made to the TD representative of the organization; and 3) the initiatives that
should be put in place to eliminate the difference between these two states according to
the results obtained from the gap analysis, see Figure 5-2. This gap analysis is
carried out initially for each question in the questionnaire, and then consolidated
for each of the dimensions d the MMTD.

Strategy
The organization wishes, in accordance with strategic planning regarding
Digital Transformation, that 100% of its collaborators and officials know their
digital strategy and take ownership of it; by recognizing that, through compliance
From this the entity will be able to achieve better standards of quality, innovation, agility,
adaptability and effectiveness in its management, as well as the objectives established for
fulfill it. And in the Strategic Plan for Information and Communications Technologies
PETIC defines its integration with the entity's general strategy, guided by
the guidelines of the Digital Government policy that proposes a model that consists of
two components (ICT for the state and ICT for society), three enablers
transversal (IT Architecture; security and privacy; digital citizen services) to
achieve the five purposes described above.
Likewise, the entity's IT strategic objective is to strengthen the management of
information and communications technologies (ICT), which allows the adoption of
standards and guidelines of business architecture for inclusive development,
sustained, participatory and transparent at each of the three organizational levels,
to communicate, supervise and manage the digital strategy transversally in the
entity, based on the importance of each activity carried out. The other objective in this
line is to enable the technology capabilities and services necessary to drive business
transformations for quality education.
And according to the selected MMTD, companies that mature digitally link their
digital strategy with the general strategy and also have a longer-term vision
of the strategy.94 Analysis of the degree of maturity of the Digital Transformation of an organization

Tasks
The entity's PETIC is aimed at: 1. Integrating and supporting the execution of the Sector Plan
Of the entity. 2. Guide and accompany the entity's senior management in programming
of investments in technology information and communications ologies. 3. Direct actions
of technology, in accordance with the general strategy of the entity and its projects. 4. Define the
policies, standards, methodologies, guidelines and recommendations that will allow a
greater use of resources, effective use of emerging technologies and
use of tools. 5. Allow the entity to establish needs in
ICT subject. With this the project portfolio will be updated according to the needs
and strategies proposed for the coming years. 6. Evaluate how it is used
the technology that the entity currently has, and take advantage of the best practices of the
different areas, to achieve a unified approach and recognize savings opportunities and
consolidation of effort.
The organization wishes according to the investment projects and its goal as a state entity
make a new social contract with equal opportunities for social inclusion,
productive and political, innovate and modernize the Technological Platform for the Improvement
of Educational Quality by recognizing digital technologies as entities of change
for your sector.
The entity considers Information and Communications Technologies (ICT) as
an important tool to contribute to the improvement of education, its impact on the
student learning is conditioned, on the one hand, to its use by
teachers in their teaching practices, and on the other, at the level of pedagogical appropriation
that they have of ICT. Therefore, designing models and strategies that take advantage of the
advantages of ICT in the use and appropriation of ICT by the educational community,
It becomes a priority aspect for the entity according to its PETIC.
Likewise, some of the ICT Guiding Principles for the entity:
❑ Alignment with the strategy: The entity's business strategy must always
be the basis for interpreting current and future needs to be resolved by
ICT solutions. In this way, the initiatives must support the objectives
strategic.Chapter 5 95
❑ Justified Acquisition: IT acquisitions are made for valid reasons,
based on appropriate and continuous analysis, with clear and
transparent. There is an appropriate balance between benefits, opportunities, costs
and risks both short and long term.
❑ ICT as a strategic asset: ICT in the organization is welcomed as
strategic assets and, therefore, those in charge of the IT function must
have the actors and organizational structure that are involved in the
understanding of the needs and gaps at the central, local and
institutional, by participating from the formulation of initiatives and their definition
conceptual and logical, and not only from the reception of requirements.
❑ Integrated Information Systems: The articulation of information systems
of the organization has a platform integrated information, which
supports missionary and support processes for decision making
strategic, tactical and operational.
On the other hand, in line with the MMTD, organizations that mature digitally have
a more agile and adaptive operating perspective through workforces
contingents, personalized work, adoption of digital trends, organized work
by modules where appropriate, building stronger relationships with partners
and organizing work around projects, rather than functional silos.

Culture
The organization wants to promote the educational offer in the city to guarantee access
and the permanence of boys, girls and young people in the educational system, in its different
forms, levels and modalities; the quality and relevance of education, with the purpose
to form individuals capable of living productively, creatively and responsibly in
community.
One of the Guiding Principles of ICT for the organization is justified acquisition,
which states that IT acquisitions are made for valid reasons, based on a
appropriate and continuous analysis, with clear and transparent decisions. There is a balance
appropriate between benefits, opportunities, costs and risks both in the short and long term
term.96 Analysis of the degree of maturity of the Digital Transformation of an organization
In the entity, potential solutions were identified with alignment to the
Data Architectures, Applications and Technology, to consolidate the projects for the
PETIC portfolio of the institution. Under the previous context, for the purposes of the PETIC in
issue, the project portfolio is one of the most important results, since this
contains the high-level conceptualization of the programs and projects whose execution and
management will materialize the PETIC.
To achieve its objective, the entity's Integrated Planning and Management Model (MIPG)
sets the following objectives:
1. Strengthen leadership and human talent under the principles of integrity and
legality, as an engine for generating results of public administration.
2. Streamline, simplify and make the operation for the generation of goods and services more flexible.

3. Develop a solid organizational culture based on information,

technology capabilities and services needed to drive transformations for
a quality education.
Another objective set by the entity in its MIPG is: 1. Strengthen leadership and talent
human under the principles of integrity and legality, as the engine of the generation of
public administration results
And according to the MMTD, the development of human talent is an important element of the
culture in entities that mature digitally, with special interest in potentiating
existing talent and recruit new talent, the latter based on their use of digital.
Digitally maturing entities provide the opportunities and resources
so that your collaborators thrive in a digital environment. When developing employees for
success in digital environments, emphasize change skills beyond the
technological knowledge.

Structure
The organization under study conceives as a fundamental pillar for the challenges that
The PETIC proposes to have the appropriate organization, which is made up of a
structure (organization chart), its functions and clearly defined processes. The map
of the entity's processes allows graphically identifying the way in which the
processes of the entity according to their nature, as well as the interrelation between the
themselves to obtain results.
To achieve its purpose, the entity's Integrated Planning and Management Model (MIPG)
sets the following objectives:
1. Strengthen leadership and human talent under the principles of integrity and
legality, as an engine for generating results of public administration.
2. Streamline, simplify and make the operation for the generation of goods and services more flexible.
services that effectively resolve the needs of citizens.98 Analysis of the degree of maturity of the Digital Transformation of an organization
3. Develop a solid organizational culture based on information,
control, evaluation, for decision making and continuous improvement.
And among its Guiding Principles of ICT, ICT is conceived as a strategic asset:
ICT in the entity are considered strategic assets and, therefore, those in charge of
The IT function must have the actors and organizational structure that are
involve in the very understanding of the needs and gaps at the central levels,
local and institutional, by participating from the formulation of initiatives and their definition
conceptual and logical, and not only from the reception of requirements.
Likewise, for the MMTD, organizations that mature digitally also value
leadership, the ability to lead a company through business model change
is the most important skill, followed by data-based decision making.
These digitally maturing entities invest in innovation capabilities to
create new products and services through digital technology, with a style of
distributed leadership in which decision-making is quick, agile and responsive
adaptive without concentrating power in a few.

Eleven of those surveyed consider, not entirely or not at all, that the

related knowledge in this area.
Eight of the entity's officials think that to develop the digital strategy,

Digital is defined in the medium term, but in changes of government no continuity is observed
management that enhances the benefits obtained in the previous period.100 Analysis of the degree of maturity of the Digital Transformation of an organization
Only three of those surveyed believe that the digital strategy is an integral part of the
general strategy of your entity, this due to ignorance of these or lack of
clarity and coherence of the digital strategy, evidenced in question one. In the Plan
Strategic Information and Communications Technologies PETIC does not see the
harmonization between the digital strategy and the general strategy of the entity because the first
is not clearly defined in this document, and harmonization is carried out
superfluously.
5.4.2 Gap analysis for the Tasks dimension
In light of the results obtained in section 4.3.2, current state of the dimension
Tasks, and compared to the ideal state of the dimension in section 5.2.2 we have
that only four of the officials surveyed believe that technologies
digital technologies will change or be disruptive to their sector to a small or medium extent, which
which is worrying from the perspective that the organization manages where it recognizes these
technologies as fundamental for the provision of a better service and the improvement of
social conditions of the sector where its management is carried out, because these do not
They share the perception of the organization.
A latent risk for the entity is evident, since all of the respondents
considers that adequate preparation of your entity for the disruptions that are expected
that occur in your sector due to digital trends are incomplete, or
does not occur, or in the worst case they do not have knowledge of the situation to take
a position on it.
An opportunity for improvement is evident for the entity, as it does not have the ability to
define strategic and operational priorities, as answered by eight of the
surveyed officials. This is one of the biggest risks a company faces.
management by not focusing on achievable goals and the efficient use of its resources,
by covering more than what management capacity allows, and even more in

This section gives the entity the option to integrate into its strategic planning

(enterprise architecture) and services according to the needs and expectations of your
sector. As a complement, the PETIC deals with Architecture of Information Systems

On the other hand, it must be clarified that in this dimension there was an option to place a
additional technology to those stated (OTHER), which is why educational content appears.
This is evidently not a technology, which reveals a knowledge
confused about what a technology is and what can be done with it on the part of
some officials of the entity.
Nine of the officials surveyed believe that the demand for the products or services
your entity's core business increases or decreases due to digital trends in
next 3 years, which determines the importance perceived from within to
launch a digital transformation process that promotes innovation,
effectiveness, improving the internal and external customer experience, decision making
assertiveness and a business model that can adapt to disruptions in the sector.
Eleven of the officials surveyed s believe that it is very likely that their entity
develop new core business lines over the next 3-5 years in response
to digital trends, which is not reflected in the PETIC by not defining any type
of value proposition in this field. That is, from strategic planning
digital organization, this plus is not given for the evolution of the business model of
this.
Ten of the officials surveyed agree that the entity has established
more solid relationships with external allies as a result of digital trends,
However, these are not evident in the PETIC nor are the strategies and policies
to achieve them.
Seven of the officials surveyed believe that their entity's work style is
closer to the collaborative type because the management of the entity is proposed through
processes that develop management in a transversal way. But, on the other hand, in
certain activities the hierarchical functioning established in the
organizational chart, where it is obtained that three of the officials surveyed agree with
that the entity's work style is intermediate between independent and collaborative.
It is also observed that the entity has two process maps, one in its PETIC
different from the one published on its website, this generated because the
PETIC is not updated and does not receive the necessary follow-up. Another opportunity for improvement102 Analysis of the degree of maturity of the Digital Transformation of an organization
along these lines is that the process map published on the entity's website, which
It is taken as a reference for this final master's thesis, it does not contain the process
of Information and Communications Technology Management, and leaves out of the
business perspective of the entity Digital Transformation. However, in the numeral

improvement in resource optimization, response agility and adaptability to change.
This as a result of the documentary analysis of the management reports of the Office of
Information and Communications Technologies for the month of September 2022
and April 2023, in which non-executions of scheduled activities and
delays within the projects due to not having an agile governance structure in

long they must travel because they are currently under construction of the
work for its construction according to the information provided by the representative in TD
of the organization and the document PlanTrabajoArquitectura-v1.
5.4.3 Gap analysis for the Culture dimension
According to the results obtained in section 4.3.3, current state of the Culture dimension,
and in parallel with the ideal state of the dimension in section 5.2.3 it is observed that six
of respondents believe that their organization's risk appetite (desire) is characterized
intermediate between daring/exploratory and cautious/risk-averse, evidenced
on the principle of justified acquisition. Additionally, due to the public nature of the
entity, it tends to be more cautious in the management of spending and its resources.
Nine of the officials surveyed consider that to a medium or moderate extent
Overall, its organization is characterized by being slow/deliberative, which means that the
Decision making is late and planning is non-adaptive.
This shows the use of traditional project management methodologies, which
are based on strong planning throughout development and a longer life cycleChapter 5 103
traditional, as well as an organizational culture that is not focused on obtaining
results.
Ten of the officials surveyed think that their organization's passion for
Work is living to work, that is, they find passion in what they do. However,
It would be necessary to analyze whether officials have equity between their professional and personal lives
since they do not consider work as a means but as an end.
Nine of the respondents strongly agree or agree that the
digital capabilities of your organization differentiate them from other entities of a nature
public. Being a leading entity and reference in the sector, they are at the head of the
digital transformation process of its population of interest, however, other
Organizations have presented innovations that can be replicated in this. Also
It is presented as a latent risk that three of the respondents do not have the
sufficient knowledge or criteria to take a position on the premise.
Nine of those surveyed believe fully or partially that their entity implements
actively initiatives to change their culture to be more collaborative, responsive to
risk and agile in response to digital trends, reflected in projects and programs
that are in force. Although these initiatives must be clearer and more coherent
for all officials.
Here the result is to highlight the level of participation of the respondents, with
exclusively the response of 12 officials of the 41 to whom the
survey; and the extension that was given by extending the closing time of the survey due to
not having a sufficient number of shares, which leads to afi sign that although the
entity is in a process of Digital Transformation in development, it is perceived
as if it were exclusively the interest and commitment of the Information Technology Office.
Information and Communications and not responsibility of the entire organization, which
It is also reinforced by what was reported by the TD representative of the organization in
regarding problems presented in the execution of ICT projects.
5.4.4 Gap analysis for the Human Talent dimension
Based on the results obtained in chapter 4 section 4.3.4, current status for the
Human Talent dimension, and in comparison with the ideal state of the present
dimension in section 5.2.4 it is evident that eight of the officials surveyed did not104 Analysis of the degree of maturity of the Digital Transformation of an organization
They are completely sure that their organization provides them with the resources or opportunities
to develop skills to thrive in a digital environment, and even more worrying
is that three people in this group do not have the tools and knowledge
necessary to express a position on the same premise. As seen in the
ideal state or TOBE, the entity sets some objectives to achieve, however, these are not

interested and willing to adopt and use technology for the evolution of their process
of management and that of your organization.
Five of the officials surveyed want to work in their entity, given the trends
digital, from 4 to more than 10 years, which goes hand in hand with the results obtained in
questions 19, 22 and 23 in which the passion for the work done is evident, the
perception of the value they have for their entity to the extent that they provide them with the
tools to thrive, and expectations for growth in training. But, something
What is striking is the uncertainty of four of the respondents who do not know why
How long do they want to work at the entity, given digital trends. This I can
be related to the results obtained in questions 4 and 20, in which they have
doubts about whether your entity's leadership has sufficient knowledge and capacity
to lead the organization's digital strategy, and whether the digital capabilities of your
organization differentiate them from other public entities.Chapter 5 105

deficient of the subject, the fear of being obsolete in a digital medium or the indifference towards
the successful development of your entity.
Eight of those surveyed are sure or very sure that they can develop the skills
to thrive in a more digital work environment, which is positive for the entity; without
However, in the professional profiles these knowledge and skills must be
included as requirements for them. On the other hand, two respondents are
concerned about not being able to develop the skills to thrive in an environment of

training and education plans. Three respondents who neither agree nor
disagreement are in agreement with the four who gave the same answer in the
question 26.

According to the results obtained in chapter 4 in section 4.3.5, current state of the
Structure dimension, and in balance with the ideal state of this dimension in the section
5.2.5 it is observed that seven of the respondents characterize the leadership structure of

in data and that has the following opportunities for improvement: technology and data
They must be considered a strategic factor for the entity that generates value; management
IT in the entity requires comprehensive coordination between operational areas,
strategic and missional, that gives results; The information must be timely, reliable
available, and be at the service of users in accordance with transparency criteria
and integrity thereof; robust characterization for IT Management processes, which
centralize roles, activities, inputs and outputs, in a consolidated, detailed and
sufficient for the challenges in the entity; need for transfer protocols
knowledge and a repository that shows all the results of each IT project
delivered by third parties; have resources and formal channels to inform about the
IT strategy; it is pertinent to review internal and external communications initiatives
in the entity.
Six of those surveyed consider that their entity is 70% closer
of being an ideal organization transformed by digital technologies and capabilities that
They improve processes, involve talent throughout the organization and promote business models.
new and value-generating businesses, or if the rating is weighted, the
entity is located on scale 6, which does not position the entity very well, leaving it with
a long way to go; This was confirmed in the analysis of the previous questions.
and in the recommendations generated; leading to a level of transformation maturity
digital in development.
Ten of the officials surveyed think that their entity is investing in
innovation capabilities to create new products and services through
digital technology evidenced in the projects launched by the entity; althoughChapter 5 107
opportunities present themselves improvement: IT service solutions must
be aligned with the processes established in the entity's process map,
for better use of the opportunities for the use of ICT, according to the
cost-benefit; strengthen the human team of the entity for the development of the
ICT use and appropriation capabilities for all the entity's stakeholders;
need for knowledge transfer protocols and a repository that demonstrates
all results of each IT project delivered by third parties; Have resources and
formal channels to inform about the IT Strategy; It is pertinent to review the
internal and external communications initiatives in the organization; update

solution architecture; definition of the internal model, parameters and guidelines for the
software development for the entity; and Implement solutions that use technologies
in the cloud, when applicable, and that respond to performance, scalability and
security of the information.
Ten of those surveyed consider that their entity mainly strengthens the
digital innovation capabilities by developing employees' digital capabilities
existing, contractors and consultants. Which presents a latent risk in the
development of external relationships, mergers and acquisitions, when pigeonholed as an entity
public that has no competition, these are opportunities that are not explored by the
organization.
Eight of the officials surveyed totally agree or agree that
Your entity's image is improving due to your digital initiatives, however,
Four of the respondents do not take sides on this statement, which presents
opportunities for improvement for the entity, since they do not recognize the benefits and
importance of Digital Transformation within your entity.

5.6 Chapter summary
The chapter meets the specific objective of proposing recommendations to the
organization to improve its level of Digital Transformation maturity based on
the results of the application, by running a gap analysis between the current state and
ideal of the organization under study.
These opportunities and improvement initiatives are aimed at ensuring that the level of
maturity of the Digital Transformation of the entity improves and can go from developing
maturing, by attacking the critical points in each dimension of analysis of the MMTD.Chapter 5 117
Among the recommendations, the one that stands out the most is the design of a digital strategy
according to the strategic planning of the organization under study, and its subsequent
socialization to ensure its appropriation by all collaborators of the
entity. Although in the Strategic Plan for Information and Communications Technologies
(PETIC) 2020-2024 of the entity refers to it, it does not define it. As second
key recommendation presents the design, implementation and maintenance of a
Business Architecture, and in third position emphasis is placed on monitoring and
update and alignment with Decree 415 of 2016 (DAFP, 2016), CONPES 3975
(DNP, 2019) and Decree 1263 of 2022 (MinTIC, 2022) of the organization's PETIC, since
Based on this, the organization's Digital Transformation vision moves and
They derive their guidelines regarding digital strategy.6. Conclusions
The objective of this final master's thesis was to analyze the degree of maturity of
the Digital Transformation of an organization, which was achieved by Characterizing the methods,
models for measuring the maturity of Digital Transformation based on a review
of systematic literature that gave way to the description of 46 maturity models for
After the execution of the selection process, define an ideal MMTD to apply in the
organization under study. As a result of this selection, the maturity model was chosen
Aligning The Organization for Its Digital Future by G. C. Kane et al., (2016). This MMTD
was adapted to Latin American Spanish and adjusted in terms of terminology and number
of demographic classification and characterization questions, which resulted in a
survey with a total of 39 questions that received the name Survey to
Digital Business Executives: Aligning the organization for its digital future.
By applying the method or model for measuring the maturity of the Digital Transformation more
suitable for the organization with a participation of 29% of the target population, s and places
to the organization at a level of maturity of the Digital Transformation in development,
finding itself in the transition from a traditional organizational structure to one that accepts
more risk, encourages collaboration, is more likely to use data in decision-making
decisions, works to closely link its digital strategies with the strategy
general of his company with a long-term vision, he strives to develop talent
existing and recruit new talent based on their use of digital, has begun to
provide the resources and opportunities for your employees to thrive in a
digital environment and its institutional leaders begin to pay attention to the
change skills.
Despite this, even the entity under study must make efforts to correct the
existing gaps to be an ideal organization transformed by technologies and
digital capabilities that improve processes, attract talent throughout the organization
and promote new business models that generate value. What led to Propósito120 Analysis of the degree of maturity of the Digital Transformation of an organization
Recommendations to the organization to improve its level of Transformation maturity
Digital based on application results, based on a current state analysis
and the ideal state for each dimension of the MMTD.
The gap analysis, the documentary analysis and the interviews carried out with the representative
in TD of the organization are tools used to complement the collection of
information obtained from the application of the MMTD, give the model the functionality of being
Prescriptive and generate a roadmap that helps the organization under study to
improve your degree of progress in Digital Transformation. Additionally, it was proposed a
improvement for the MMTD in which the questions of its questionnaire were grouped according to
the dimensions it proposes to facilitate the analysis of results and generation of
recommendations.
Among the key recommendations, the definition of an appropriate digital strategy stands out
to the strategic planning of the organization under study, and its subsequent
socialization to ensure its appropriation by all collaborators of the
entity, the design, implementation and maintenance of an Enterprise Architecture, and the
monitoring and updating of the organization's PETIC since, based on this,
moves the organization's Digital Transformation vision and its guidelines are derived
in terms of digital strategy.
It is very necessary that the organization where the selected MMTD was applied conceives its
Digital Transformation process as an extension of your strategic planning
aligned with the Digital Government Policy through Decree 1263 of 2022 (MinTIC, 2022)
National Development Plan 2023-2026: Colombia world power of life (DNP,
2023), as observed in the gap analysis, the lack in the
room ility and knowledge of its officials to implement the digital strategy, this
exposed to risks that management faces by not focusing on achievable goals
and the efficient use of its resources, by covering more than what allows achieving the
management capacity, and even more so in Digital Transformation.
The organization also has late decision making and its planning is
is not adaptive, which slows down your Digital Transformation process by not considering the
technology and data as a strategic factor for the entity that generates value, in the
lack of comprehensive coordination between operational, strategic and missional areas,
that gives results in IT management, and where finally, the information is not beingConclusions 121
timely, reliable available, and is not at all times at the service of the
users in accordance with its transparency and integrity criteria.
However, as a great strength of the entity, the interest of its talent is presented
human being to learn new knowledge and acquire new skills that enable them
be effective in your digital environment for the improvement of your organization.
On the other hand, it is concluded that preparing for a digital future is not an easy task. Means
develop digital capabilities in which activities, people, culture and
structure of a company are synchronized and aligned with a set of objectives
organizational. However, most companies are limited by the lack of
resources, lack of talent and the pull of other priorities, leaving executives
in charge of managing digital initiatives that take the form of projects or are limited to
activities within a given division, function or activity or channel. In a world
increasingly digital, Digital Transformation is not just about implementing more and
better technologies, implies digital congruence: aligning culture, people,
structure and tasks of the organization.
The scope of the proposed objectives was achieved by executing the descriptive study
established, since it was aimed at measuring the presence, characteristics or distribution
of the maturity of the Digital Transformation in the organization under study, limiting
to describe one or several phenomena without the intention of establishing causal relationships with
other factors and without intentional manipulation, only the phenomena were observed as they were.
as they occurred in their natural context, with the combination of quantitative techniques and
qualitative tests to obtain the required information, which offered an idea of ​​the level of
maturity of Digital Transformation but, as is evident, it is not generalizable to
all entities in the sector and does not generalize the situation of the organization object of
study. Likewise, the MMTD Aligning The Organization for Its Digital Future by G. C.
Kane et al., (2016) provides a comprehensive overview how Digital Transformation occurs
within a company from its strategy, culture, human talent, structure and tasks,
as well as the possibility of delimiting its objective state by defining what the conditions are
of a company in digital maturation.122 Analysis of the degree of maturity of the Digital Transformation of an organization
Limitations
In the development of this degree work, there was a limitation regarding access to
the implemented methods of various Digital Transformation maturity models
(MMTD) to measure the maturity of organizations in terms of digital transformation.
Although 46 maturity measurement models were obtained in the RSL, very few
presented complete information for implementation, only 43% of
MMTD had this information. Additionally, the Maturity Model of
Selected Digital Transformation was only applied to one organization due to
that access to these is restricted, and we worked with a non-probabilistic sample for
convenience of a single case.
Regarding the application within the organization under study, it was also stated
a lack of interest on the part of your collaborators towards the opportunity to improve their
degree of success in Digital Transformation, having a reduced participation of 29%,
which does not provide the possibility of having a more complete picture of what is happening
really within the organization. As well as very long periods of time for
respond to information requirements, on average 2 to 3 months to provide
solution to requirements necessary for the continuation of the study. On the other hand, the
target population was not very familiar with administrative terminology
regarding the business model, stigmatizing the concepts of business, competition,
customer, productivity and performance only to those private companies of a nature
commercial for profit and competition. Furthermore, they have the paradigm of being
a unique public entity of its kind in the region that does not have a comparative reference
that makes them take advantage of opportunities for improvement, with the exception of the regulations that
They must comply by law. The latter is clear evidence that confirms the reason for the low level
of participation in this exercise.
Contributions to the Field of Application
As a contribution to the field of application, it is expected that organizations acquire
a structured and robust understanding of Digital Transformation and Business Models
Digital Transformation Maturity, by designing and implementing this process based on
their particular needs and aspirations, conceived from a holistic and
continuity of the entire entity and its organizational philosophy; to change in this way, the Conclusions 123
misconception about Digital Transformation as being a simple acquisition of
new technology. Likewise, it is expected that the methodology described here for selection and
application of a MMTD provides tools and support to organizations starting or
are immersed in the adventure of Digital Transformation.
Contributions to Industrial Engineering
As a contribution to Industrial Engineering, we wish to deliver a reference study for the
measurement of the level of maturity of Digital Transformation, in which its methodology can
be replicable and its results are taken as a comparative basis for other analyses.
Jointly, it seeks to deliver a broad and strongly constituted state of the art that
allows a higher level of appropriation and transfer of knowledge in Transformation
Digital. It is worth highlighting that the characterization, here achieved for a total of 46 MMTD from
the year 2011 to 2023, has no precedents in the literature, therefore, it is an instrument
very useful in understanding and generating new knowledge in Transformation
Digital.
Likewise, the expansion of the MMTD methodology is a contribution.
selected with the addition of gap analysis that provides the necessary roadmap
to increase the degree of maturity of the organization's Digital Transformation, as well as
such as the modification that was made to the MMTD Aligning collection tool
The Organization for Its Digital Future by G. C. Kane et al., (2016) by grouping their
questions according to the dimensions it defines, which facilitate the study of its results and
proposed recommendations.
Future jobs and possible lines of
investigation
Among the possible future works and possible lines of research are:

The framework methodology that has been used to develop the model
is based on Becker's step-by-step process for developing
maturity models that have a solid theoretical basis in the approach
of Hevner's design science and offers a rigorous methodology.
A development procedure was carried out that includes three phases
well differentiated. An initial phase to create understanding
complete mastery of Industry 4.0, a central development phase
to design and layout the structure of the model, as well as a
practically applicable tool and an implementation phase
to validate the resulting tool in real-life application.
The evaluation of maturity through the elements of maturity
within a company is carried out using a questionnaire
standardized consisting of one closed question per item.
Each question requires a response on a Likert scale ranging
from 1- "not at all different" to 5- "very different." The qualifications of the
experts were included in the development procedure to
find out the contribution to the maturity of the element, on the one hand, and
to validate the practical importance of the element of maturity, on the other hand
side. The distribution by email of 123 questionnaires to
professionals and researchers resulted in 23 responses. The
practical importance of each maturity item was rated on a
Likert scale ranging from "not important" (rating = 1) to "very
important" (rating = 4)

An online survey was adopted as a method for this
research because it allowed rapid distribution cycles and
response, as well as automatic verification and response capture
in databases. The survey was based on a questionnaire designed
originally by Wendler (2014), which, in turn, was based on a
exhaustive review of the literature and its purpose was to “generate a

important objective was to evaluate the perceptions among the entire
personnel, regardless of the classification level, the questions
of the survey were assigned to two separate questionnaires: Managers
and General Staff.
For purposes of granularity in terms of evaluation of the
survey results, the study team first grouped the
questions according to each of the six dimensions, and then the
classified by subthemes, which were based on what Wendler (2013)
called "agility concepts". The questions were asked in a
five-point Likert scale, based on the original survey.
Both surveys used a behavioral approach, whereby
observable behavior was measured instead of asking about the
subjective beliefs of an individual.

Innovation, telecommuting and public educational
libraries: ways to digital transformation in the
post-pandemic world of work
Jobson Louis Almeida Brandão ¹ Valmira Perucchi ²
Gustavo Henrique de Araújo Freire ³
ABSTRACT
Introduction: The development of more assertive public policies in
libraries, in accordance with the dynamics of telecommuting that are
being created, is an essential debate in the field of Information Science.
Objective: This article discusses the evolution of public educational
libraries in telecommuting to serve a community of professionals who
work and communicate in a network. Methodology: Methodologically,
the research has an exploratory level, a qualitative approach, developed
through bibliographical research and elaborated from the data of a
doctoral research that uses the action science method. Results: The
results highlight the possibility of innovation through remote work in the
federal public service, especially with the advent of Decree 11,072, of
May 17, 2022; the opportunity to innovate in the public sector with a
promising service performed by public educational libraries at federal
institutes; and the inseparability between work and research agendas, as
well as between social development and digital transformation. | 1
Conclusion: It is concluded that the paths for the digital transformation
in the world of work can become even more productive, innovative,
profitable and sustainable, when the continuous and adequate
investment in library infrastructure that fulfills an educational function
and is of a public nature is sought; and in policies that ensure the
performance of librarians as agents of innovation in federal institutes.

RDBCI| Campinas, SP | v.21| e023001 | 20231 INTRODUCTION
Promoting social development through digital transformation in the world of work in a
post-pandemic environment is as challenging as it is promising. After all, opportunities often
arise in unpredictable moments of crisis and, consequently, unexpected changes. Public
libraries are at the center of these changes and opportunities in the networked information
century. This phenomenon has required information professionals to take a proactive approach
to innovation.
Innovation is comprehensive and transversal, so we adopt as conception of innovation
the development of new products and services, with innovative methods and actions, such as,
for example, citizen labs, ideas incubators, virtual learning environments, creative spaces and
participatory environments enabling access to online collections and digital information.
These innovations, which when put into practice bring improvement to a service,
product, or process existing in a library, contributing to make the lives of people who use the
products and services offered by it easier.
The mapping of scientific literature to identify the evolution of the theme Innovation in
the field of Information Science carried out by Gabriel Júnior, Sousa and Silva (20 20, p. 5-6)
states that
[...] it is very difficult to have a definition of innovation that meets all areas and
contexts. In the IC area, innovation is very much characterized as a process of
improvement or transformation of processes and services. [In CI, the concept of
innovation as a development or improvement of processes and services occurs mainly
with the insertion or updating of new technologies and also transformations and
modifications in management processes. This type of innovation in existing processes
is always thought of to meet the demands of a specific group of users of information
services. For some types of institutions that offer information services, innovation in
services and products offered becomes a more difficult process due to the
aforementioned costs necessary for the effective implementation of new services. | 3
Gabriel Junior, Sousa, and Silva (2020) discuss two types of libraries very common in
Brazil: the public library and the university library. About the first, the authors state that it has
enormous potential for innovation as from the Information and Communication Technologies
(ICTs) because they enable better interaction between users, products and services, favoring
autonomy in tasks related to the services offered by the library, however, it is pointed out as the
main challenge the fundraising for the appropriate investment in these technologies, given the
reality of public libraries in the country, notoriously known as precarious from the point of view
of economic investment from public policies. In relation to the second, the authors point out as
a barrier the lack of knowledge, for the library's maintainers, of the importance of innovation
to generate value because they perceive it as a conventional space. Gabriel Junior, Sousa, and
Silva (2020) point out that:
The concept of innovation in a university library should also be associated with the
development and improvement of products and services related to scientific
communication, since a large part of its public is made up of researchers and students
who need scientific information to carry out their activities and develop their research.
It is important to mention that both in the study by Gabriel Júnior, Sousa and Silva
(2020), the most updated scientific mapping on the theme (Innovation) in the IC field, and in
all the scientific literature investigated as from the research that originated the present article,
there is no approach on innovation in libraries of federal institutes, which currently in Brazil,
play an educational role in the public sector in a more comprehensive way than university
libraries, for serving users linked to the secondary/technical and higher education level, and for
being present in a widely distributed manner throughout the national territory. This gap begins
RDBCI| Campinas, SP | v.21| e023001 | 2023to be filled with this article, the first of a series of publications that intends to address the issue
with the intent of dev eloping it in the scientific and professional field with a view to both the
public educational library and the librarians' work beyond the library, in other spaces suitable
for their work in innovation ecosystems.
During the pandemic period between the years 2020 and 2021, professionals from
various fields learned new lessons about the most diverse issues that interfere with lifestyles
and ways of life as we know them. This was a landmark of significant changes, including
changes in the world of work and employment. Among several, the issue of changes in the way
of life at work, especially the future of remote work and the role of public educational libraries
in this dynamic context in Brazil, interested the present study.
During ENANCIB 2021, the authors of the present article proposed that these are
libraries that support with info educational actions the teaching, research and extension
practices developed by public educational institutions, whose function is educational, and their
nature is public. Conceptually, from the perspective of their organizational identity, public
educational libraries were defined as: information units, with a priority educational purpose and
of public nature, which meet the information needs of both the academic public, at all levels of
teaching, needs and skills, and the technical-administrative public and the community in
general, through info educational actions. The collection of such institutions can be made up of
works that are multicultural, extracurricular, and linked to the lifelong learning process,
covering all age groups, without distinction. The libraries of the federal institutes are an
example of this type of information unit in Brazil. However, this does not exclude other libraries
to identify themselves in this organizational identity, being necessary to deepen the theme in
future studies.
Two points constitute the starting point that inspired this research. First, the observation
of the recent transformations that have occurred in the working environments of the
communities to which the authors of this article are linked, carried out during doctoral research.
Second, the contemporary reflection woven by an experienced North American professor about | 4
the innovation that has emerged over time in public libraries. Author of many books and articles
about the policymaking process and how to improve the management of public organizations,
Steve Kelman, Professor of Public Administration at Harvard University, published on August
2, 2021, in the traditional and renowned American blog about federal public administration,
FCW (Federal Computer Week), an article entitled in its translation “Public Libraries and
Government Innovation”. This article is the focal point of the reflection that originated the
present research and discussion.
It is usual that at the core of discussions on public information policies, in the field of
Information Science (IC) in Brazil, a convergence is sought, in an interdiscipl inary way,
between what is said in the scientific literature of the Administration field (and Public
Administration) with the IC literature itself (and Librarianship in numerous instances).
However, recently, the debate on sustainable development, urban infrastructure and smart cities
has gained notoriety and broadened the interdisciplinary range of issues investigated in this
scientific field. This occurs due to the evidencing of the urgency in solving and dealing with
climate issues for human survival on planet Earth, and its unfolding, which include rethinking
the quality of life at work and the need for presence in diverse situations and environments.
It has been a trend, therefore, that professionals and researchers from other fields of
knowledge, with emphasis in this discussion on the field of Architecture and Urbanism, become
interested in public libraries and their social function in urban spaces. Historically, there is an
evolution in the appreciation of libraries as civic spaces, beyond the idea of exclusive spaces
for the promotion of reading and books, defended throughout the 20th century as places
primarily for study and research.
Kelman (2021) mentions in his article his satisfaction in recently coming across the
article by Liz McCormick, a summer urban scholar at New Urban Mechanics in Boston, USA,
RDBCI| Campinas, SP | v.21| e023001 | 2023who works on management innovations for the city. The article, titled in translation “The
Radical Potential of Libraries,” mentions new ways of library use following the pandemic,
and was published on the City of Boston's institutional blog, specifically on the page of the
Mayor's Office of New Urban Mechanics, which is a kind of research and development
laboratory in Boston, and also serves as a civic incubator for ideas within the city government.
In Europe, there has been a lot of talk about the implementation of Distributed Citizen
Labs in public libraries. Initiatives such as the recent offer of the course Laboratorios
Ciudadanos Distribuidos (available at: https://curso2021.labsbibliotecarios.es/) for librarians
and professionals from Brazil, in the distance learning modality, promoted by the Ministry of
Culture and Sports of Spain, through the General Direction of Books and Reading Promotion,
demonstrates the importance of the theme and of the insertion of libraries in the context of
citizen innovation. Diego Garcia, coordinator of the Libraries Laboratories project, of the
mentioned Spanish ministry, highlighted at the beginning of the course, through a speech
broadcast on the YouTube platform on April 30th, 2021, the importance of reinforcing the role
of libraries as meeting and collaborative learning spaces, where the promotion of democratic
values is guaranteed.
Distributed Citizen Labs, conceptually, can be understood in a broader and more
complete way from the perspective of social researcher Lorena Ruiz (2021, p. 1-3),
disseminated within the first module of the course promoted by  the Ministry of Culture and
Sport of Spain, divided into six aspects, namely:
Chart 1. Distributed citizen labs defined in 6 aspects
ASPECT CONCEPTUAL PERSPECTIVE
First, the citizen lab is a new form of institution, one in which openness, accessibility, and re-
appropriability predominate. [...] in a citizen lab, people can make proposals and thus become
1.
producers (of their own or other people's ideas) rather than consumers (of something
predetermined by the institution).
| 5
Second, a citizen lab is a meeting space for different actors to collaborate on the development of
2.
a shared idea.
Third [...] participation in a citizen lab is its connection to its closest environment. Regarding this
aspect, it is about valuing the culture of proximity, prioritizing the meeting and cooperation
between different actors linked to the same context (a neighborhood, a city, an organization,
3.
etc.). The laboratory is therefore a tool for listening and observing what happens in these contexts,
trying to identify the community's needs, desires, resources, and strengths that can be put into
action to develop collective ideas.
Fourth, [...] the laboratory works in a specific way, from the logic of experimentation and
prototyping. This is one of the most characteristic and relevant features of the proposal of a
citizen laboratory because it implies prioritizing the process over the result, accepting uncertainty,
4. and supporting it collectively, and relating directly with error, understanding it as another learning
resource. Experimentation, due to its open, provisional, and even playful nature, allows the diverse
knowledge of all participants to be brought together, and thus promotes cooperation and the
creation of bonds, particularly of trust and reciprocity.
Fifth, the articulation of diverse actors around the development of a common idea generates a
large volume of knowledge. A citizen lab is not only a space in which this production of knowledge
is possible, but also a tool so that the knowledge generated continues to circulate after the lab is
5.
over and can be useful in other contexts. To achieve this, we work from the principles of free
culture (freedom to copy, distribute, modify, and improve other people's creations), documenting
the work done in the development of each idea.
Sixth and last, the conceptual positioning and the main characteristics we have indicated respond
to the fundamental purpose of a citizen lab: to create communities of learning and practice. These
communities are intended to be spaces to collectively test forms of self-management, knowledge
6.
production, and coexistence because in a laboratory people participate who, for the most part, do
not know each other and have not chosen to work together, and therefore it is necessary to
establish a learning relationship with others. All this with the aim of improving the conditions of
RDBCI| Campinas, SP | v.21| e023001 | 2023coexistence in our neighborhoods, our cities, or our instit utions; in short, in those places that are
close and meaningful to those who inhabit them.
Source: Chart organized based on the conceptual perspective of Lorena Ruiz (2021, p. 1-3).
The purpose of the distributed citizen labs, according to Ruiz' perspective (2021),
evidenced in the sixth aspect, matches the action-science method (ALMEIDA; PERUCCHI;
FREIRE, 2020), in which it is used the creation of learning communities, called research
community in the context of application of the scientific method; being this critical for obtaining
results.
Thinking about the possibility of convergence between a work agenda in the library and
a research agenda with a group of researchers linked to the library for innovation, it is inferred
that the implementation and/or the development of citizen labs distributed in libraries can be
part of the methodological strategy for socialization of information, fostering the generation of
new knowledge, development of actions for information competence and for digital
competencies; in line with the assumption of the social responsibility of Information Science.
According to McCormick (2021) libraries have served, since the period of the industrial
revolution, as a welcoming point for newly arrived immigrants to learn, engage, and gain
support in their quest for American citizenship. Other possibilities are noted by Kelman (2021)
from other reports, namely: recreational use of the library by teenagers after school hours; use
of computers and the Internet in the library to resolve legal matters; and use of the library to
entertain children with storytelling.
Historically, in Brazil, the library spaces have always been used in various recreational
and formative ways, beyond the storage of the bibliographic collection. During the pandemic,
these spaces were physically limited, making it impossible for people to attend exhibitions,
lectures, training sessions, classes, and other cultural and educational activities that have always
been possible in library environments.
Information and education services have migrated to virtual learning environments.
| 6
With this, reading and communication habits and practices, including the ways of learning,
were – even if temporarily – modified, to adapt to the restrictions of the pandemic period and
the proper continuity of the activities.
The pandemic period was not the first historical moment that demanded innovation from
libraries. While in the United States of America, libraries were important in welcoming
immigrants since the industrial revolution, in Brazil, libraries were and still are welcoming
places for people in conditions of social and economic vulnerability.
In the post-pandemic context, without restrictions of physical presence in the library
environment, it may return to its normal performance, but, probably, having to innovate before
the changes in the informational behavior of people, which was influenced by the pandemic
period. Certainly, new demands will emerge regardin g the offer of products and services within
the hybridism of current times.
Given this observation, Kelman (2021), asks “What will happen after libraries are
reopened in a safer, more vaccinated world?” McCormick (2021) is also concerned about this
future of the library in the post-pandemic context and reports on the development of work
between his office, the Boston Public Library, and the city's Department of the Environment in
which they are experimenting with developing two overlapping ideas, namely, “How can
libraries evolve into remote workspaces and serve the community by playing a critical role in
heat resilience as Boston gets hotter?”
Such a question emerges after a year of closing physical access to libraries during the
pandemic period. The work developed by McCormick (2021) makes it possible to note that
urban climate resilience is one of the contemporary environmental issues where the library can
effectively contribute, as we will see in the discussion presented in this paper starting in the
RDBCI| Campinas, SP | v.21| e023001 | 2023second section. Given the above, our research question took, therefore, the following contour:
How can public educational libraries in Brazil evolve into remote workspaces and serve the
diverse communities of professionals who work and communicate in networks? The objective
of this article was to discuss the evolution of public educational libraries into remote
workspaces to serve a community of professionals who work and communicate in a network.
One of the most relevant points that interested the research was to know the possibilities of
innovation in the public sector through remote work and the role of public educational libraries
in this context, from the perspective of Information Science.
2 METHODOLOGICAL PROCEDURES OF THE RESEARCH
Methodologically, the research is characterized as exploratory, of qualitative approach,
developed through bibliographic research and elaborated from ongoing doctoral research,
which makes use of the Science-Action method. As a technique, the research uses reflection in
action to obtain scientific evidence and analyze data that culminates in the formulation of
proposals relevant to the scientific and professional context. We compared the data on the
reality of North American public libraries obtained by bibliographic collection, based on the
reports of researchers and librarians working in this context, with the Brazilian reality. This
comparison resulted in the production of a reflection focused on the performance of the libraries
of the Federal Institutes, classified by the authors of this study as public educational libraries.
In a pioneering way in the field of Information Science in Brazil, Chloé Valdary's
enchantment theory is applied as a strategy of methodological approach to produce a critical
reflection about innovation in the public sector, emphasizing the subjectivity inherent to human
relations at work. Statistical data from recent surveys by the Institute f or Applied Economic
Research (IPEA) and the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE) were also
consulted to support this reflective study with evidence. | 7
The reflection presented in the following sections was structured in three parts, which
address the triad innovation, remote work, and public educational libraries, in theoretical
correlation with the possibilities of scientific and professional action, based on the purpose of
highlighting a necessary debate in the field of Information Science in the 21st century.
Specifically, such debate subsidizes the evolution of studies on public information policies in
libraries and their social implications in Brazil.
The present study was carried out with the support of two research groups, the result of
an inter-institutional partnership between the Research Group on Project Management in
Education, Science, Information and Technology (PROJECIT), from the Instituto Federal da
Paraíba (IFPB), and the Research Group Communication, Networks and Information Policies,
from the Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ). Part of the data obtained in the present
investigation is also the result of doctoral research in progress at the Graduate Program in
Information Science (PPGCI), at the Federal University of Paraíba (UFPB). The present article,
therefore, is the result of collaborative and integrative work in the scientific community.
3 WHERE TO START THINKING ABOUT INNOVATION THROUGH REMOTE WORK?
To get to the answer to the question that gives this section its title, we start from
Kelman's (2021, n.p.) perception of innovation in American public libraries, when discussing
specifically the public library's contributions to urban climate resilience in Boston, based on the
work developed by McCormick (2021, n.p.), highlighting that during the pandemic:
The library system implemented free outdoor Wi-Fi spaces at 14 locations, while
branches were closed, providing secure outdoor Internet access. The libraries created
RDBCI| Campinas, SP | v.21| e023001 | 2023six shaded work areas to make the free Wi-Fi easier to access and more fun to use.
They have set up picnic tables, an outdoor café, and misting tents outside the libraries
as well, some of which have already been set up as places to alleviate borrowing
requests.
Although Kelman (2021) is not sure why so much innovation has emerged over time in
American public libraries, while some other government organizations themselves remain tied
to conventional practices, he points to it being due to the general lack of political controversy
surrounding public libraries. The researcher notes that usually government innovation arises
from crises and threats, but that it is different with libraries. What drives innovation in libraries
is their organizational security, which fosters the confidence and self-confidence of innovators.
This may be a favorable and preponderant factor for innovators to find in the library a favorable
space for creativity and  innovation not only in the United States, but also in Brazil.
This point is no different from the Brazilian reality, as we have observed in recent
decades. However, when it comes to innovation in public libraries, it is not quite like that, for
it is a complex issue. Corroborating with Kelman (2021), we infer that the reality of these
information units suggests that more organizational security favors the creation of space for
innovators to approach change with confidence and self-confidence, both in the United States
and in what we can estimate in Brazil, from the evidence collected.
McCormick (2021) makes us reflect that in times of instability around the world, where
trust in public institutions has diminished and continues to be threatened, public libraries remain
highly trusted public entities. She correlates this trustworthiness given to the library to a public
from all neighborhoods, various age groups, and generally by a diverse audience. She concludes
her article by mentioning that despite the gradual replacement of physical records of knowledge
by the world of digital information, the role of libraries remains more important than ever. This
position coming from a professional from another area, outside the field of Librarianship and
Information Science, is critical to validate and legitimize the discourse of librarians who fight
| 8
for more investment and better working conditions to offer new and better services, and that
has often been discredited by public managers.
In one of the recent publications of the Federal Council of Librarianship, Herrera (2015,
p. 188), librarian of the public library of the city of San Francisco, in the United States, justifies
the relevance of innovation in libraries, highlighting that:
Today and in the future, libraries must constantly reinvent themselves. We can remain
loyal to our core mission of providing access to information and promoting reading.
However, we need to re-examine the traditional model to shift the focus more toward
bringing the library to the people. This means that we need to reshape service models
to one that is more proactive in community outreach and to offer services that target the
user. We also need to make our libraries more accessible as community spaces for
education and civic engagement. Now is the time to reinvent the way we do our work.
Librarians have remarkable skill sets to help build community, teach the new
knowledge, and redefine our public libraries as learning and knowledge centers of the
21st century that will help solidify the information digital and social divide.
Data from the 2015 survey conducted by the National System of Public Libraries
indicate that there are 6,057 public libraries throughout the Brazilian territory, considering the
sum of municipal, district, state, and federal libraries, which would offer an approximate
average of one public library for every 33,000 inhabitants (SNBP, 2021). There is no disclosure
of separate data between levels of gov ernment.
Despite this, the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE), released in 2019
data from the Municipal Basic Information Survey (MUNIC), which pointed to a reduction in
the number of municipalities with public libraries by 10% over a four-year interval, in the period
from 2014 to 2018. It is assumed, therefore, from the reports and the observed data, that there
is a possibility of greater stability within state and federal libraries, compared to the municipal
RDBCI| Campinas, SP | v.21| e023001 | 2023reality. This may vary according to the economic conditions of each municipality, after all,
there are exceptions, and the case of São Paulo is one of them, considered one of the
municipalities that stand out in the valorization and quality of public libraries, such as the Mário
de Andrade Library, which is municipal, and the award-winning Villa-Lobos Park Library,
which is statewide.
In Brazil, data from the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE) in 2018
already pointed out record numbers of remote work in the home office format even before the
COVID-19 pandemic. The number reached 3.8 million Brazilians working in this condition in
the mentioned year. IBGE points out that at the time, the home office work regime became an
alternative to circumvent unemployment. Disclosing the data, Silveira (2019, n.p) highlights
that
According to IBGE, the home office corresponded to 5.2% of all employed workers
in the country, excluding public sector employees and domestic workers. Compared
to 2012, when the historical series of the survey began, this contingent increased by
44.4%. The home office, highlighted the IBGE, fell 2.1% between 2012 and 2014,
grew 7.3% in 2015, and fell again by 2.2% in 2016. Between 2017 and 2018, it grew
by 21.1%.
.
Góes, Martins and Nascimento (2021) published through the Institute for Applied
Economic Research (IPEA), a conjuncture letter in the first half of 2021, which presents official
government statistical data on remote work in Brazil, based on the year 2020. Such data was
also published by Agência Brasil, a public news agency of the federal government, which
confirms its relevance for governmental decision-making processes in Brazil, serving as a basis,
also, to compose the evidence of studies and scientific research on the subject. This survey
pointed out that there was a decrease in the number of home office workers in the month of
November 2020; however, the number remains much higher than the 3.8 million pointed out
by the IBGE in 2018, being registered approximately 7.3 million in the recent IPEA survey
(BRASIL, 2021). | 9
The recorded drop is natural, considering the proximity of the pandemic control,
observed from the advancement in safety protocols and vaccination, and gradual return to
normality. What is currently raising questions, especially in the field of Public Policies, which
also interests Information Science in terms of information policies, is the permanence and/or
transf er of in-person activities to the remote work format, exclusively or as a hybrid; the
advantages and disadvantages of this migration; and the conditions of viability and permanence
of this work model.
The most recent fact, in the post-pandemic Brazilian context, which contributes to
innovation in the public service is the publication of Decree 11,072, of May 17, 2022, which
regulates telework and productivity control in the federal public service under the Executive
Branch. The greatest innovation provided by the decree consists in the autonomy for the top
directors of the entities of the indirect Federal Public Administration, which includes federal
public autarchies and foundations, to authorize the implementation of the Management and
Performance Program (PGD); which was previously restricted to the Ministers of State. The
untying favors the reduction of bureaucracy in the implementation of the program. The
normative act improves both the management of results of public agencies and agents, and the
rules related to telework. With this, telework will now be possible on a part-time or full-time
basis in federal institutes and universities. This government innovation in Brazil was possible
due to the successful experience with remote work during the Covid-19 pandemic. In an
increasingly digital reality, it has become evident to public managers the viability of
telecommuting in the public sector. The measure can contribute to the reduction of costs of the
public machine, can favor the cultural change of time and attendance control by controlling
results and the quality of public services, and can also result in higher quality of life for federal
civil servants, better productivity, and serve as an example for governments at the municipal
RDBCI| Campinas, SP | v.21| e023001 | 2023and state levels to rethink the form of work adopted, without compromising the efficiency of
public power, and encouraging professional performance in accordance with the objectives of
sustainable development.
The evidence of innovation through remote work and the correlation with libraries have
been noticed in scientific works in the field of Information Science. We highlight the increasing
approaches about coworking and other innovative spaces (Chart 2). In the molds of the present
research, structured from bibliographic research and with a qualitative approach, the study by
Moyses, Mont'Alvão, and Zattar (2019) is one of the examples of a recent scientific publication
that points out these innovative spaces in libraries. The spaces noted in the research are maker
spaces, learning commons, and coworking spaces, which, according to the researchers, “make
the library more active, collaborative, creative, and innovative, which differs from traditional
models that emphasize the consumption of knowledge.” (MOYSES; MONT'ALVÃO;
ZATTAR, 2019, p. 5).
Chart 2. Innovative library spaces

These are spaces that are conducive to collaborative learning. They consist of a

These are spaces that have the objective of sharing the physical structure, furniture,

Regarding the exemplification of these spaces, we have that maker spaces in Brazil, as
mentioned by Moyses, Mont'Alvão and Zattar (2019, p. 15) are present in school libraries and,
also, in public libraries, the example of
initiatives such as in the Villa-Lobos Park Library (BVL) that hold maker workshops
that teach different activities, such as book production, robotics, home maintenance
with a focus on different user profiles. [...] also has an inclusive and accessible
environment [...], with several assistive technology devices, such as page flipper,
ergonomic table, autonomous reader, audio player, ruler rail, adapted keyboard and
mouse, computers with screen reader, adapted mouse and keyboard. [...] has already
been indicated as one of the best in the world for its illuminated environment,
spaciousness, and democratic space. It has also been classified as an active library,
whose architecture itself favors the reader's experience, besides stimulating and
facilitating activities of multiple natures.
Moyses, Mont'Alvão, and Zattar (2019, p. 17) cite the São Paulo Library, another state
public library, as an example of learning commons.
It was conceived to be a bold space and offer comfort, autonomy, and attention to
users, seen as central elements of the library. It occupies an area of 4,257 square
meters to meet the needs of different user profiles. It has technological resources and
makes microcomputers, wireless and self-service terminals available. It was inspired
by the Santiago Library, in Chile, and was nominated in 2018 as one of the best in the
world.
The concepts are very similar within a collaborative space proposal. We can affirm
that in some libraries, there is the presence of two or more of these spaces. In the research by
Moyses, Mont'Alvão, and Zattar (2019, p. 17), the researchers again point to the Parque Villa-
RDBCI| Campinas, SP | v.21| e023001 | 2023Lobos Library (BVL), of the State of São Paulo (SP), this time to make mention of the
coworking space it contains.
In 2018, BVL opened a coworking space on the second floor of the library [...], which
corresponds to a shared workroom with infrastructure an d Wi-Fi network for use by
micro and small companies, startups, or people with projects or ventures in
development. The projects selected, through a public notice, can use the room free of
charge for ten months. In return, they must offer workshops or seminars in the
project's specialty for of the public.
All these innovative spaces converge towards the idea of a library that aims to be a
“center of socialization and conviviality” (MOYSES; MONT'ALVÃO; ZATTAR, 2019, p. 20).
Libraries in the 21st century are moving toward being spaces with greater interactivity, intense
collaboration, and more fruitful and complex relationships. This spirit of welcoming and
inclusion that has always been present in libraries is accentuated as the social dynamics of
digital transformation we experience in contemporary times takes on new contours and evolves.
With remote work being more frequent in the lives of several professionals, for example,
network communication requires that more attention be paid to managing emotion and
understanding the dimensions of organizational solicitude (mutual trust, access to help, active
empathy, leniency in judgments, and courage) (VON KROGH; ICHIJO; NONAKA, 2001).
Both are important in enabling the processes of facilitating knowledge creation and, why not,
also organizational innovation.
One of the theories that has stood out internationally in contemporary times is the theory
of enchantment, especially in times of remote work. In a recent publication on Instagram, the
National School of Public Administration (ENAP), linked to the Ministry of Economy of Brazil,
posted on its official profile, on August 05, 2021, the following question: Why is it important
to create and maintain rituals to generate connections with your co-workers?; In the post, ENAP
mentions the American activist and writer Chloé Simone Valdary, who applies the Enchantment
| 11
Theory in leadership training and in the compassionate fight against racism. As stated by ENAP
(2021, n.p) the theory is innovative due to combining “social-emotional education, character
development, and interpersonal growth as a tool for leadership development.” In the theory's
approach, Valdary blends elements of pop culture to facilitate the dissemination and
understanding of the dimensions and principles of the theory. Disseminated among students,
schools, companies, and governments in several countries, including the United States, South
Africa, the Netherlands, Germany, and Israel, the theory was presented for the first time to a
Brazilian audience during a live online broadcast from ENAP on April 28, 2021.
Chloé Valdary spoke with Diogo Costa, the President of ENAP, and highlighted the
importance of applying the three fundamental principles of the theory in the development of
human beings, namely:
1. treat people as human beings and not as political distractions;
2. When criticizing, elevate and empower, never with the intent to tear down or
destroy;
3. Doing everything with love an d compassion. Love in the sense of the Greek term
agape, not based on conditions. (ENAP, 2021, n.p)
In this discussion, we highlight innovation in the context of public organizations and
realize the relevance of leadership, social-emotional education, and the theory of enchantment.
We also discuss the interdisciplinary convergence between Administration and Information
Science, and as a result, it is possible to transpose from the literature on family rituals, in the
context of Psychology, the conceptual distinction between ritual and routine to the
organizational core. Taking as a basis the question raised by ENAP (Why is it important to
create and maintain rituals to generate connections with your co-workers?), when proposing to
think about enchantment in times of remote work, we sought in Azevedo's (2018, p. 8)
RDBCI| Campinas, SP | v.21| e023001 | 2023explanation, under the perspective coined by Fiese et al. (2002), the difference between routine
and ritual, detailed in three dimensions, namely:
communication, investment, and continuity. Regarding routines, the first dimension
refers to the instrumental act - "this is what needs to be done;” the second dimension
refers to the temporary character and little consistency after the routine is performed;
the third dimension tells us that it is directly observable and detectable by outsiders, and
the behavior repeats itself over time. In contrast to rituals, the first dimension refers to
the symbolic act - "this is who we are;” the second dimension tells us that rituals are
enduring and affective, and the experience can be repeated in memory; the third
dimension refers to the extension of meaning across generations, and this is interpreted
by insiders. (AZEVEDO, 2018, p. 8).
Transposing such knowledge to the organizational environment, we can understand that
routines organize work processes, and their repetition over time can transform them into rituals,
through anticipation and emotional investment. However, a ritual can become routine if it starts
to be felt as an obligation. We can consider that routines and rituals enable organizations to deal
with the adversities that emerge from their performance, whether public or private.
We can also consider that we cannot dissociate the study and research on innovation and
remote work from socioemotional issues involving people of different generations. Especially
in the context of public educational libraries, this inseparability is even more evident, since it
is a space where these several generations meet and seek to meet information needs and other
types of needs, ranging from children's entertainment to being a support point for teenagers
after school, for refugee immigrants seeking information to achieve their citizenship, among
others.
So far, our reflective path has allowed us to realize that starting to think about innovation
through remote work, inserting public educational libraries, constitutes a broad debate with
several challenges. Besides t he above, it is also necessary to think about information policies
in libraries and the need for social and emotional education of young people and adults. It is not
| 12
possible to think about innovation in this context without trying to understand the issues that
make sense for new generations, such as the y, z, and alpha generations, which are the most
challenging audience for libraries at the moment.
How to apply efficient library management to promote the development of the
generations? This is one of the implications of the debate, which leads us to start thinking about
Generations Management. Developing information actions that leverage the best of each one
of them can be a starting point of a work and research agenda for research librarians.
In the context of the Federal Institutes, public educational libraries have the commitment
to attend and satisfy, through their products and services, the employed generations, the
unemployed ones, and those who are in the process of training to access the world of work and
employment very soon. The challenge is even greater in this context.
Thinking about the innovative contribution of the public educational library to the
issue of remote work, therefore, will require thinking that its strategic management may include
everything from the analysis of reports to the evaluation of quantitative and qualitative
indicators on the diversity of generations. It is necessary to think what can enable more assertive
actions, such as the development of incentive programs for productivity; the promotion of
greater involvement of social actors in decision-making processes; greater digital presence and
engagement of young people and adults; and other actions, even motivational ones, also
focusing on the management of emotions in the workplace, a subject that has received more
notoriety and relevance nowadays.
The pandemic and post-pandemic context, worldwide, has inspired us to be creative,
innovative, and adaptive. We have learned by necessity at the time of the pandemic and are
applying to the new moment to work well remotely, moving towards hybrid models (remote
RDBCI| Campinas, SP | v.21| e023001 | 2023and face-to-face activities), more flexible and adaptable to networked social dynamics. We are
facing crises and opportunities.
A promising service is in demand, and public educational libraries are at the center of
the problem and the solution. From it, solutions may emerge that contribute to innovation
through remote work, if possible, adding the importance of the three dimensions:
communication, investment, and continuity; defended by the enchantment theory, along with
its three principles, which collaborate in facing and breaking paradigms that interfere with
productivity and organizational culture in the public sector.
4 A PROMISING SERVICE PERFORMED BY BRAZILIAN PUBLIC EDUCATIONAL
LIBRARIES
Importantly, innovation in information services is central to the evolution of libraries.
Public educational libraries  have evolved to become remote workspaces, with the purpose of
serving communities of professionals who work and communicate online.
Is the creation of remote workspaces or zones in educational libraries a really
promising and viable initiative? Perhaps the answer to this question is only possible with the
implementation of public policies that guarantee the promotion and, therefore, the adequate
investment in infrastructure and beyond. Experimentation may be the best alternative for these
libraries to become citizen laboratories, and effectively fulfill their educational function, with
innovative services based on the idea of learning libraries, guided by the five disciplines of
Peter Senge: personal mastery, mental models, team learning, shared vision, and systemic
thinking.
Other questions emerge from this conjuncture, namely: How to define the diversity of
remote working professionals who would seek the library as a remote workspace? Possibly, the
implementation and management of distributed citizen labs can contribute to this knowledge of | 13
the public and their needs. It is action and reflection in action that will guide the evaluation and
innovation agenda that is sought in remote work and libraries.
The very social mission of the federal institutes in the context of professional and
technological education in Brazil, with emphasis on the importance of offering remote work
support service in public educational libraries, justifies the investments in this segment of
professional performance of librarians.
What can we reflect on in this section to start thinking about the construction of a work
and research agenda? The search for ways to contribute to the success of digital transformation
in the world of work, which encompasses greater public investment in libraries, is challenging.
Digital transformation is a process, not an arrival point or a destination.
In order to contribute to the formation and development of a research agenda on
innovation in the scientific field of Information Science and in the professional field of federal
institutes in Brazil, it is necessary to bring together researchers, especially research librarians,
linked to these institutions, working in the country. Gabriel Junior, Sousa, and Silva (2020), in
their mapping of the scientific literature on the most productive authors in the subject of
Innovation indexed in BRAPCI in the period 1978 to 2019, identified that the only researcher
linked to a federal institute is the Librarian and PhD in Information Science, Valmira Perucchi,
from the Federal Institute of Paraíba (FIPB). From this study, it is observed a change in this
scenario, with the beginning of a research agenda that can fill this gap and overcome the
incipient scientific production on the theme, from a series of publications, according to this
article that is also the result of a doctoral research.
Regarding the work agenda, the function of the public educational libraries is to
contribute to the Federal  Institutes in their mission to promote teaching, research, and extension
through professional, scientific, and technological education with the union of information,
RDBCI| Campinas, SP | v.21| e023001 | 2023education, and technology to ensure sustainable local, regional and national development. Even
in the face of the context in which we find ourselves, in which it is a challenge to build online
the relations and structures of an educational institution, as in the case of the Federal Institutes
and their public educational libraries. According to Paula, Silva and Woida (2020, p. 3),
libraries are the basis of education
serving as a support for teaching, research, and extension, and for this reason, they are
reinventing themselves in the current scenario by offering services and informational
products such as book loans in delivery, training, workshops, lives of information
competence on how to use information sources safely for research, standardization of
academic papers, scientific writing, among others.
With the need for the services provided by public educational libraries having to adapt
during the pandemic to the social isolation and distance, the professionals who work in them
had to adapt to a new reality, the remote work. Thus, they have had to review their services and
actions to continue with the importance they have always had in the educational context while
still meeting the information needs of their users in a satisfactory manner, as quickly,
efficiently, and effectively as possible, as is customary.
Trends are becoming reality in our day-to-day lives. It must also be understood that they
have had to reinvent themselves in offering and making online information products and
services accessible and easy to handle for users. The user experience is central to this way of
life.
To work with the emerging reality, public educational libraries have expanded the use
of services offered on social networks such as Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook, as well as
service channels using WhatsApp and electronic forms, and have made available and assisted
in the use of open access databases that enable users to access e-books and scientific articles.
In this way, the libraries
| 14
have been engaged in improving their information services and products by making
information available through websites, social media, and networks such as
Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, and other media. These communication means are
great disseminates of information and where several subjects are connected daily,
causing information to circulate at greater speed because these informational channels
allow librarians and users not only to seek interaction, but also to make information
sharing (PAULA, SILVA; WOIDA, 2020. p. 8).
The pandemic required the process of joining technology and education, forcing us to
use, in a systematic and general way, digital media for sharing information, providing services,
and other activities. It is necessary to think and plan for this  post-pandemic context, with the
offer and creation of innovative spaces, with services that ensure the safety and health of
everyone involved in the libraries. This process can be guided by an agenda oriented to social
development, as the digital transformation guides contemporary life, in all processes and
information flows.
5 AGENDA FOR SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT AND DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION
Drawing up a work agenda in parallel to drawing up a research agenda is not only
possible, but necessary these days. There is a clear inextricability between the work agenda and
the research agenda, as much as there is for social development and digital transformation from
this century onwards.
In an experimental way, in this section we will address a proposal for a work agenda
that can be applied in public educational libraries, through a research agenda that is being
constituted in the scope of the Research Group on Project Management in Education, Science,
RDBCI| Campinas, SP | v.21| e023001 | 2023Information and Technology (PROJECIT), linked to the IFPB Campus João Pessoa and
registered with the National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq)
since 2014.
Some questions can be applied via e-mail to the librarians responsible for the libraries in
the system, to have a local sample of the perception of these managers on this subject; and,
later, expanded for comparative studies. This is a proposal for application in future studies.
There was no need to apply a questionnaire at this point in the research because we are in a
stage of reflection. These questions could be developed based on a small group of guiding
questions, namely:
a) During the pandemic, what did you do differently in your remote activities that you did not
do before the pandemic and that may have generated innovation?
b) In the library is innovation through remote work possible?
c) Traditionally, the library is a study and research space for students. do you think the library
can become a remote workspace for professionals? What conditions would you need to
make this service viable?
Ruiz (2021, p. 3, our translation) states that: “All living beings share vulnerability, not
as weakness, but as that which, in needing each other, allows us to link, ally, and support each
other.” The researcher points out that this vulnerability became much more evident with the
social and health crisis stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic. As argued by Ruiz (2021),
we have the potential to create collaborative networks in research and the workplace, but we
need the resources and proper infrastructure to do so. These resources and the necessary
infrastructure can be obtained by formulating activity-specific public policies in the public
sector.
However, it is first necessary to spread among librarians, researchers, public managers,
and other professionals relevant to the issue in public organizations, the potential of the public | 15
educational library in order to generate innovation from remote wor k. In this sense, it is
necessary to develop a research agenda that supports a work agenda, so that information policies
are assertively developed, resources are allocated, and the promotion is effectively carried out
in these public sector environments that lack innovation.

The seven themes pointed out above do not exhaust or limit the research agenda
that is being constituted. They are the starting point for a research work based on the Science-
Action method in the context of Information Science, constituting an unprecedented proposal
for intervention in the scientific field, bringing theoretical contributions to a scientific field that
is increasingly aligned and closer to the practices of information professionals and the needs of
current and future generations of information users and producers in a networked society.
RDBCI| Campinas, SP | v.21| e023001 | 20236 FINAL CONSIDERATIONS
The results highlight the possibility of innovation through remote work in the federal
public service. We are facing an opportunity to innovate in the public sector with a promising
service that can be performed by public educational libraries in federal institutes in Brazil: the
appropriate infrastructure for remote workspaces.
We also observed an inseparability between the work agenda and the research agenda,
as well as between social development and digital transformation, from this century on, as far
as these educational libraries are concerned.
The study aims to contribute to the development of more assertive public policies for
this type of library, its public and its new work dynamics that are being constituted. It is possible
that solutions to real problems faced in the daily life of information professionals will be
proposed based on the research agenda that is being developed at the inter-institutional level.
The fruitful path that Science-Action has been building in Information Science in Brazil, with
studies that bring together the theories in use in the professional context with the theories
proclaimed by the scientific field, shows the possibilities of innovation that are to come.
The alignment of studies on educational library infrastructure with the development of
smart cities in the context of creative economy, entrepreneurship and digital transformation will
reveal new possibilities and solutions in the core of the field of Information Science to meet the
emerging demands of the network society. It  is, therefore, a promising theme for us to start
thinking about the construction of a Brazilian Digital Agenda based on the contributions of this
scientific field.
We conclude that the paths to digital transformation in the world of work can become
even more productive, innovative, profitable, and sustainable when we seek continuous and
adequate investment in infrastructure and innovation of libraries that fulfill an educational
function and are of a public nature, following the high level of social relevance of the federal
| 16
institutes in the context of inclusion through professional, scientific, and technological
education in Brazil.
It is necessary, still, continuous investment in the formulation of public policies,
especially information policies, to ensure the role of the librarian as an agent of innovation in
federal institutes. As the next step of the authors of this research, considered as a fruit of the
research, a scientific article will be communicated on how the information policy correlates
with the innovation policy in federal institutes, covering in its discussion the theoretical-
pragmatic model for the development of information policies of Brandão (2022), and the
challenges arising from the post-pandemic scenario from the Digital Agenda eLAC 2022 and
the recent actions occurred in Brazil that favor the development of the Digital Society.

Background
The UK construction industry has been frequently berated for its problems of low
productivity, delays, unsafe work practices and the delivery of projects that exceed planned
costs1 . To tackle these problems, the Government2 has ramped up efforts to drive an
increase in the use of digital technologies and manufacturing approaches for delivering
construction projects and managing built assets. Building Information Modelling (BIM)3 and
Offsite Manufacturing (OSM)4 have been put forward as the two key innovations that can be
used to deliver projects faster, cheaper, safer and at higher quality. The current Industrial
Strategy (IS), the Construction Sector Deal5, outlines the Government’s partnership with
industry to promote the use of BIM and OSM to reduce construction and whole lifecycle
asset costs by over a third, reduce delays in construction project delivery and greenhouse
gas emissions by half in 2030. The Construction Playbook, recently published by the Cabinet
Office6, sets out how the Government is prioritising the deployment of these innovations
through public sector procurement in order to make their use mainstream in the
construction industry.
For any of these goals to be achieved, the construction industry needs to embrace the use of
BIM and OSM on a large scale. However, this will only happen if construction firms (i.e.,
consultants, general contractors, specialist subcontractors) are able to adopt and use BIM
and OSM successfully. Despite this critical need for engagement, both take up and use
remain low. There are several reasons for this7, and the lack of evidence of the ‘real’ benefits
of the use of BIM and OSM  has made construction firms reluctant to embrace their
adoption8.

1Despite this, some construction firms are successfully using BIM and OSM. The experiences
of these firms can provide useful learning for other construction firms.
About this guidance
This guidance document describes six key factors that will help construction firms to
transform their project delivery through the adoption and use of BIM and OSM. Our
research has shown that construction firms that have successfully adopted and are using BIM
and OSM share six common characteristics:
 committed leadership and management;
 a digital transformation strategy with realistic objectives;
 competent supplier networks built through a ‘growing together’ approach;
 trust-based relationships with their clients;
 well-developed training and skills development initiatives for employees; and
 robust structures for effective collaboration and communication.
The insights shared in this guidance draw on interviews with over 40 construction industry
stakeholders in the UK (contractors, consultants and clients) who have undertaken
commercial, residential and infrastructure projects across the country and overseas.
Nine recommendations are put forward in this guidance document. Designed to guide
construction firms taking steps to adopt and use BIM and OSM, the recommendations are
specifically targeted at senior executives and managers of construction firms, regardless of
size, who can implement initiatives to enable their firms to adopt and use BIM and OSM, or
improve what is already in place.
2What does it take to successfully adopt and use digital
technologies and offsite manufacturing?
Figure 1 illustrates how the leadership and management of a firm is crucial for creating a
framework within which all the other factors can be implemented. It also shows how
implementation of  these factors has both internal and external implications for firms.
Figure 1: Enabling factors
In the sections that follow, each factor is described and supported by relevant industry
examples and key recommendations for implementation by other construction firms.
3Committed leadership and management
A firm needs committed leadership to support the process of change. Having a leader who
will champion the digital transformation vision within a firm is essential for success9.
A transformation agenda cannot focus solely on technology but must consider individual
practices and internal culture in order to successfully establish new ways of working among
employees. For a transformation strategy to ‘trickle down’ through a firm, leaders need to
believe in the strategies they are implementing. A leader-champion can be an executive or
manager who believes in the urgency of digital transformation, its long-term benefits and
who is committed to implementing the necessary strategies to achieve the vision. This will
involve communicating the digital strategy and vision in ways that appeal to employees and
their work-related aspirations. Engagement needs to be personalised and people-focused,
and spearheaded by a manager (or committee) who understands this and is able to
communicate clearly and coherently across all areas of the firm and its supply chain.
A supportive leadership culture values employee suggestions. Ensuring that input from
employees is treated in a way that shows that they are valued is important, because this has
a direct impact on employees’ willingness to be a part of the transformation – a factor that
can either constrain or facilitate digital transformation. When employees see that their
suggestions have been implemented in a company’s practices, it can boost their
participation in the digitalisation agenda. To ensure that employees are genuinely involved in
the transformation journey, it is crucial for management to communicate regularly and
clearly with employees, and be open to receiving feedback. This is important for successful
digital transformation.
Leadership training resources are available through the Construction Industry Training
Board’s (CITB) three-years funded scheme, ‘Giving leaders the skills to drive digital
transformation’10, the National Construction College’s (NCC) Management and supervisory
courses11, and the Supply Chain Sustainability School’s range of courses,12 all designed to
give leaders in construction firms the skills to drive digital transformation.

4Industry example 1: Multiplex
Multiplex is a leading  global construction company operating in Australia, India, Canada,
Europe and the Middle East that uses innovative technologies to execute large-scale and
complex projects in residential, mixed-use, education, health and civil infrastructure
developments. The firm employs over 6000 people13. Based on its latest turnover, it ranks
19th in the top 100 UK construction companies list14. In 2019, Multiplex were judged to be
the ‘Most Innovative Contractor’ at the Building Innovation Awards15.
According to their Digital Transformation Executive, Fred Bloggs, much of Multiplex’s efforts
have focused on employee engagement and cultural change. Multiplex’s leadership strategy
is people-focused and guides their digital transformation agenda. Where new technologies
and practices are introduced, employees are treated as individuals and their career
aspirations are taken into consideration in parallel with the task changes that will need to
take place.
Internal and external innovation competitions are used as a strategy for motivating
employees to gain recognition for digital innovation. Internal competitions recognise project
teams that have, over a year, been able to meet specific targets related to the use of digital
technologies. Recognition by external industry awards also ‘serves as a big boost for the
team since they know they are working in one of the best firms in the industry when it comes
to using these digital innovations’.
Recommendations
Appoint a digital transformation leader-champion
It is crucial for construction firms to appoint a person (or team) who will champion the
transformation vision and who is committed to the urgency of digital transformation and
who will drive and oversee the implementation of a digital transformation plan. The leader-
champion needs to hold an executive or management position, as this creates employee
confidence in the transformation vision and agenda.

5Lead by example
Senior executives and managers in construction firms implementing a digital transformation
plan should aim to drive the vision internally at every opportunity and on all projects.
Leadership by example demonstrates commitment to the digital transformation agenda,
showing how the vision can be realised through everyday internal and project-related
activities. Leaders should foster employee confidence in the vision, the implementation
strategy and the expected outcomes from the transformation journey.
Lead people, don’t focus solely on technology
Whilst getting the right technology is important, focusing attention solely on technology
tends to relegate an important aspect of achieving digital transformation – changing
people’s perspectives.
It is important to develop a leadership  plan that focuses on enabling people to fulfil their
potential whilst embracing the use of new technologies. Leadership that focuses on
changing the minds of people by appealing to their individual, work-related aspirational
goals enables employees to achieve goals for the use of digital technologies.
6A digital transformation strategy with realistic
objectives
A digital transformation strategy is a plan that shows where a firm is at, outlines a vison of
change and provides guidance for how that change will be achieved in the future. A clear
digital transformation strategy should be developed and implemented by construction firms
seeking to make greater use of digital technologies and OSM16,17.
A successful digital transformation strategy provides a step-by-step map of how to create a
new firm culture around the use of new technologies18. Tools are available to help firms
assess their current digital capabilities and competencies and to benchmark them against
potential competitors so that future actions can be improved19,20. Construction firms seeking
to undergo a digital transformation will benefit from undertaking such an assessment prior
to developing their digital transformation strategy21.
A digital strategy should be geared towards establishing new routines and practices and
creating a new firm culture, with a focus on people, processes, routines and technology22.
Our research suggests that a digital strategy that achieves transformation:
 uses simple language to communicate the goal of transformation;
 gives employees a sense of ‘shared ownership’ in what is to be achieved;
 is consistent and can be repeated across the firm;
 considers the needs of people (employees) in introducing new technologies and
processes; and

strategy is the use of BIM as Business-as-Usual for all projects, regardless of clients’ requests.
Divisional and regional managers are responsible for adhering to this and are tasked with
effectively and consistently communicating the strategy to their teams. Digital managers
from its six regional Local Construction Offices (LCOs) contribute to this strategy by
proposing additional local strategies that align to the national digital.
This approach enables direct employee input to feed into the development of the national
Willmott Dixon digital strategy, given the large size of the firm, and allows LCOs to
incorporate any unique digital needs of clients and projects into the overarching national
digital strategy through the local strategy. The national and local strategies are therefore
aligned to achieve the same transformation objectives.
The incorporation of local digital strategies by the LCOs has created an avenue for
employees to propose new digital technologies for consideration. Prior to adoption, new
technologies are examined to ascertain their fit with the company’s strategic goals and
processes. This step provides an opportunity to establish the individual and collective
benefits for internal operations and on projects. This creates an awareness among employees
of the positive benefits yielded by the digital strategy at the local level and across the entire
firm.

8Recommendation
Design a simple, clear and people-focused digital transformation strategy that can be easily
communicated
Construction firms, regardless of size, need to develop a digital strategy that sets out realistic
transformation objectives in plain language. It should be simple, easy to understand and
consistent. It should be consistently communicated across all levels and areas of a firm, and
repeated until a new firm culture has been established.
It is very important that senior executives and management support and drive the
development of the strategy alongside their employees. Jointly creating a digital
transformation strategy is critical for ensuring that employees have shared ownership of the
vision and objectives that the strategy articulates.
9Building a capable supplier network through a
‘growing together’ approach
Construction firms need to ensure their supply chain has the necessary  skills and capabilities
to deliver projects using BIM and OSM. To achieve this, they may need to support their
supply chain to develop these capabilities.
Firms operating as suppliers in the construction supply chain are critical for successful project
execution as contractors are heavily reliant on their supplier networks, including
general/specialist (trade) subcontractors. Whilst some contractors have developed
capabilities to use BIM and OSM, not all of the firms they work with in their supplier
networks will have such capabilities. The successful use of BIM and OSM on projects requires
that suppliers also have the necessary level of skills and capabilities. This may involve firms
helping to equip subcontractors so that they can use the same or similar hardware and
software or tools when working on projects using BIM and OSM. There are resources
available for construction firms to assess their supplier network needs25,26 as part of their
digital transformation programmes.
Some of the large contractors interviewed are adopting a ‘growing together’ approach to
build and upskill a supplier network with the necessary capabilities for working on projects
that involve the use of BIM and OSM. This supportive approach involves hosting workshops,
training sessions and company visits to learn of capability challenges and to offer training
support to suppliers. By adopting this approach, firms have learned about the challenges
faced by their suppliers in terms of the digital skills of their staff, hardware, software and
training needs, and as a result they have offered bespoke assistance to address these needs.
This approach has also enabled contractors to share the digital and manufacturing
capabilities needed for future projects. This transparency ensures that supplier firms aware of
what they will need to keep working on projects with the contractors, and is considered to
be a ‘win-win’ approach to building a competent supplier network. The ‘growing together’
approach has proven to be particularly useful for construction firms seeking to make the
transition to using BIM and OSM with their supplier network, building on working
relationships that have developed over the years.

10Industry example 3: Skanska
Skanska is one of the world's leading construction and project development companies,
operating in the residential and commercial property sectors in the Nordic region, Europe
and USA; Skanska has around 34,000 employees27. Based on their latest turnover, this multi-
award-winning company ranks 13th among the UK Top 100 construction companies28.
With their supply chain delivering around 80% of the company's turnover, Skanska’s digital
capability relies heavily on supply chain transformation. Skanska recognises the need  to
support its supply chain as part of successfully implementing its digital transformation
strategy. The firm is eager to maintain their longstanding working relationships with these
suppliers because they have built a lot of trust with them. Part of their approach involves
providing their suppliers with access to training offered by the Supply Chain Sustainability
School29 – of which Skanska is a founding member, in partnership with the CITB. The fact that
the resources provided are free to use removes one of the major barriers to upskilling the
supply chain.
Another of Skanska’s strategies involves increasingly challenging their supplier network
partners to explore the use of new technologies on projects. Skanska encourages their
suppliers to develop the capabilities needed to work with them using these technologies,
using a strategy called ‘innovation-push’.
A ‘growing together’ strategy involves providing the requisite training, workshops and
regular communication necessary to inform firms in their supplier network about digital
technologies that can be adopted for doing things more quickly and with less labour, as well
as how to use more off-site approaches. This provides Skanska with opportunities to keep
their supply chain partners informed about the digital capabilities required for specific
projects. Continuous engagement with their supplier network partners means that Skanska is
able to learn about capability gaps and support them in a learning process towards
improvement. This focus on developing their supplier networks has been a key component
for the successful implementation of projects using BIM and OSM.

11Recommendation
Support your supply chain to develop their digital and OSM capabilities
Large contractors should aim to assist firms in their existing supplier networks to improve or
build capabilities in using BIM and OSM for projects. Doing so will save time and resources in
establishing new working relationships and in building trust with other firms they may not
know well. It is therefore helpful to support trustworthy and high-performing suppliers to
develop relevant capabilities for using digital technologies and OSM.
This ‘growing together’ approach can be achieved through the hosting of workshops and
training sessions with subcontractors in order to understand their needs and jointly develop
plans to help their development. There are mutual benefits to be gained in doing this. A
strong supplier network equipped with digital and manufacturing capabilities is crucial in
demonstrating relevant capacity at the tendering stage of projects, and critical for successful
project delivery.
12Building trust-based relationships with clients
Clients are key players who can drive innovation in the industry, and obtaining their buy-in is
crucial in order  to increase the use of digital technologies and offsite manufacturing. This is
particularly important for private sector clients who are under no obligation to use any
specific technology or approach for their projects, unlike public sector clients who are
obliged to require the use of BIM30, and to give a presumption in favour of using OSM,
where it could lead to value for money31.
Clients are typically concerned about getting the job done at the lowest price in order to
maximise returns on investments, and using digital technologies and OSM is often seen as
generating additional costs which clients are usually not willing to bear32. Convincing clients
about the use of BIM and OSM therefore begins with winning trust. Building a trust
relationship usually takes time and involves honest communication, offering reliable
information about the inherent risks and the benefits associated with these innovations. It
also involves meeting agreed expectations regarding the use of BIM and OSM, having
mutual respect for values, and maintaining a good reputation by following contractual
requirements33.
Industry example 3: Multiplex
At Multiplex, a combination of approaches is used in order to educate clients and to present
them with the business case for the use of digital technologies. Fundamental to all the
strategies used is building trust. At Multiplex, building trust with clients is achieved by being
transparent at the outset about the suitability of specific digital technologies for projects and
their possible benefits, and by offering critical professional advice on suitability. For every
project, they actively engage with clients to assess which aspects would benefit most from
the use of specific digital technologies and involve them in selecting suitable technologies
for the job, from an early stage in the project. This approach enables otherwise reluctant
clients to see the usefulness of the technologies for their projects.
Multiplex relies on visual communication tools, including 3D modelling and virtual reality in
order to demonstrate the benefits of digital technologies. Regularly updating clients on

13project progress using these same tools (as well as drone footage of ongoing work) helps to
boost client trust and increase confidence in the use of innovative technologies for future
projects.
Recommendation
Build transparent, long-term trust-based relationships with clients
Construction firms should make deliberate efforts to demonstrate the  value of using digital
technologies and OSM for project delivery to clients. This requires building relationships
based on mutual trust over time through professional advice and clear and consistent
articulation of the potential financial and sustainability gains to be made from using digital
technologies and OSM. Being able to demonstrate that the promised benefits and savings
were delivered is crucial to maintaining that trust.
14Training and skills development initiatives for
employees
Employees need to be supported to develop the necessary skills and competencies to enable
them to engage with digital technologies and OSM. Rather than assuming a particular level
of digital competency, firms need to establish a baseline of individual competencies so that
employees can start their skills journey at the right level for them.
The digital competency scale provided by the CITB34 is a good resource for undertaking this
task as it helps to identify which groups of employees need which specific skills and
competencies. The Supply Chain Sustainability School35 also has a wide range of programs
available for training employees at different levels of competencies.
To complement these, bespoke or one to one training which is tailored to individual digital
literacy is crucial. In addition, it is useful to provide all employees with the basic skills for
operating any underlying platform prior to introducing application software as part of a
digital transformation programme. Companies should bear in mind that soft skills training
including collaborative skills, system thinking, and communication are as fundamental as
hard skills.
Industry example 4: Kier
Kier is a leading UK construction and infrastructure services company, with almost 20,000
employees36, ranking second37 among the UK Top 100 construction companies. This multi-
award-winning company38 was also shortlisted for recognition under the category of the Best
Skills & Training Innovation at the Building Innovation Awards 201939.
As part of their digital competencies training, Kier provide in-house training, designed in line
with Kier’s digital transformation agenda. The training involves regular one-to-one meetings
between BIM Coordinators and design and project employees and aims to identify digital
learning needs and assign employees to learning sessions that will provide them with the
requisite skills and knowledge about software, programmes and processes. These sessions
are designed to take account of individual knowledge and skills. Regular drop-in sessions

Recommendations
Upskill employees in the use of new software and adapting to modified processes
Upskilling employees is a priority for construction companies in the journey from
conventional methods of working to the use of digital technologies. Attention needs to be
paid to helping employees adapt to new technology-driven processes and software
changes40.
Creating opportunities for employees to take the initiative in learning about the use of digital
technologies is also critical. To this end, companies should support their employees to
undertake relevant training courses provided by relevant institutions, including the CITB41,
British Standards Institution (BSI)42, Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS)43 and
Supply Chain Sustainability School44.
Provide tailored training based on employee digital competency levels
Employees need to be equipped with soft skills, and generic and role-specific competencies.
Not everyone needs to know everything, but all employees should achieve competencies in
the use of certain ‘basic’ digital platforms (e.g., Microsoft Teams, Skype and Microsoft Office).
Incorporating clear competency profiles into role descriptions ensures that employees
understand the skills they are expected to have and the tools they are expected to use.

16Robust structures for effective collaboration and
communication
As construction firms seek to make more use of BIM and OSM, they need to establish new
ways of communicating that facilitate greater collaboration and the sharing of data and
information45.
Collaborative work (e.g., design and model analysis) based on shared information systems
requires changes to traditional work practices and routines; these become more complicated
where multiple firms work on a project46.
Collaborative design practices require different professionals coming together to work
together in cross-functional teams47. Firms should aim to develop team structures that place
less emphasis on control and strict differentiation in the functions of teams (e.g., IT analysts,
designers, project managers). Rather, creating cross-functional teams with structures that
promote freer communication encourages collective creativity in problem solving and
encourages employees to take the initiative when working with new tools, technologies or
implementing new processes. Teams need to work with software platfor ms that can ‘talk to
each other’ and are interoperable as easy communication can reduce the likelihood of
conflicts and enhance collaboration.
Effective collaboration and communication using BIM are not compatible with traditional
methods of organising and sharing information, such as physical files, and construction firms
will need to change their systems of data capture, storage and sharing of quality data.
Implementing changes to how data is captured, shared and stored should be preceded by
the dissemination of clear documentation in a digital format. This should set out the
deliverables and data expected from each department inside the firm and from each party in
the project supply chain. Construction firms need to embrace electronic means of sharing
information in order to facilitate seamless work with others effectively across multiple teams.
Guidelines for data integrity and accuracy need to be established, as well as clearly defining
the responsibility of each employee regarding data input and security. Putting such

17protocols in place is essential to establish new practices and greater collaboration and
communication that will support wider use of BIM and OSM.
Industry example 5: ISG
ISG, one of the world’s most dynamic construction services companies, is ranked 7th in the
UK Top 100 construction companies48, and was the winner of the Construction News Award
2018 for Supply Chain Excellence49. Their 2,800 worldwide specialists in fit out, technology,
and construction deliver buildings in Europe, the Middle East and Asia.
To facilitate effective communication, ISG operate a ‘horizontal structure’ that has two senior
managers leading two teams of twenty-four members. This structure enables BIM managers,
BIM coordinators and BIM technicians to raise different issues among themselves and to
support each other as well as other stakeholders. As part of this structure for communication,
employees write weekly reports to a senior manager about the challenges they have
encountered when using BIM or other digital technologies.
Teamwork is fundamental to ISG’s digital strategy, and employees are encouraged to
communicate with each other regularly. Quarterly gatherings allow employees to share
information with colleagues about projects, about new technology or software being used,
or  about challenges faced.
To ensure effective communication with firms in their supply chains, ISG provides its supply
chain partners with detailed documents outlining expected deliverables and timelines as part
of the project communication ahead of meetings. They also hold regular meetings with their
project partners to assess the deliverables at each stage and to discuss next steps.
Recommendation
Create enabling structures for effective communication and collaboration
Developing structures that will facilitate effective communication and collaboration, both
internally and with supplier networks, involves the creation or restructuring of cross-
functional, interdisciplinary teams. Establishing inter-disciplinary teams will enhance
collaborative working and needs to be prioritised. It will have the added benefit of helping
professionals from different disciplines learn how to work effectively with others using the
same or similar digital tools and software. Firms need to ensure that BIM and OSM platforms

18and systems used for design functions can ‘talk to each other’ in ways that do not result in
any data loss, as this could lead to miscommunication and potentially create conflict.
Furthermore, construction firms should convert data and information formats into digital
versions for easy sharing across platforms, internally and across project supplier networks, in
a timely manner and at different project stages (e.g., RIBA Stages)50.

19Conclusion
This guidance has presented six factors, identified through research and industry examples,
that are critical enablers for construction firms to adopt digital technologies and to make
greater use of OSM:
 committed leadership and management;
 a digital transformation strategy with realistic objectives;
 building capable supplier networks through a ‘growing together’ approach;
 building trust-based relationships with clients;
 training and skills development initiatives for employees; and
 robust structures for effective collaboration and communication
The guidance emphasises the importance of having a clear digital transformation strategy
guiding a journey of change, backed strongly by leaders who believe in the transformation
vision and who work with and train their employees in order to achieve the goals of the
vision. Building transparent, trust-based relationships with clients by offering reliable,
professional advice about the use of digital technologies and OSM is also important. Building
structures that enable collaboration, enhance clear communication and prioritise feedback is
also crucial for construction firms seeking to successfully adopt and use BIM and OSM.
We have outlined nine key recommendations to guide construction firms in taking st eps to
adopt and use building information modelling (BIM) and offsite manufacturing (OSM):
 appoint a transformation leader;
 lead by example;
 lead people, don’t focus solely on technology;
 design a simple, clear and people-focused digital transformation strategy that can
be easily communicated;
 support your supply chain to develop their digital and OSM capabilities;
 build transparent, long-term trust-based relationships with clients;
 upskill employees in the use of new software and adapting to modified processes;
 provide tailored training based on employee digital competency levels; and
 create enabling structures for effective communication and collaboration.
20Implementing these recommendations will allow construction firms to successfully make the
internal changes that will allow them to adopt and use BIM and OSM for project delivery.

Abstract
The project explores the possible impacts of digital transformation on journeys to work through the
development of a city-level digital twin (CDT) prototype that integrates data, models and insights from
multiple disciplines and sectors. The research includes three work packages, 1) empirical investigation
of key factors affecting worker’s choice on place of work (e.g. fixed workplace, work at/from home) and
on travel mode in the Cambridge sub-region; 2) developing a digital twin prototype including a web-
based interface for simulating journeys to work and testing two digital transformation scenarios
(prevalence of teleworking, large-scale adoption of electric vehicles); 3) engaging with local
authorities, modelling experts and other key stakeholders to collect feedback on the application and
future development of CDT. A productive partnership has been established between the local
authorities and the project team for the co-development of the digital twin prototype. The project also
collaborates closely with academics at UCL and Cambridge. Key research outputs are discussed in
detail and a series of working propositions are proposed, which may guide the future research on
CDT.
2A City-Level Digital Twin Experiment for Exploring the Impacts of Digital Transformation on
Journeys to Work in the Cambridge Sub-region
1 Introduction
We are living through the “4th Industrial Revolution”, moving from a period of relative data scarcity to
an era of ‘digital abundance’. The sheer size of investments and efforts for building “smart cities”
across the globe has epitomized the inspiration for future better cities in the digital era. In the UK, the
National Infrastructure Commission has outlined an ambitious plan of building a national “digital twin”
of UK infrastructure, which aims to demonstrate UK’s global leadership in smart infrastructure. The
digital twin brings together individual infrastructure models and the interdependencies between them
through a federated system, thus represents a coordinated approach for planning, constructing and
managing national infrastructure. The potential benefits of the national digital twin are apparent –
optimising use of resources, reducing service disruption, increasing resilience and boosting quality of
life for citizens, but how to materialise such benefits through effective policy making remains a big
challenge ahead.
While the digital twin technology is making great strides in the UK with several large-scale pilots under
construction (e.g. Exeter, Bristol, Queen Elizabeth Park in London) or being considered (e.g. Smart
Cambridge), the varying and changing socio-economic and political context of the UK cities implies
that the digital twin alone is unlikely to be a one-size-fits-all solution to city challenges. For example,
wh ile congestion has been regarded as a prevailing issue across major cities, there are actually 20%
fewer commuting journeys per person per week in the UK in 2016 than the mid-19901. This trend has
often been attributed to a wide range of transformations regarding the nature of employment such as
more part-time work, more people working from multiple places (e.g. teleworking), increasing self-
employment (e.g. the “gig” economy), etc. Such behavioural changes are complex and will have
profound implications on how we plan, use and manage our future infrastructure. However,
understanding such changes requires an inter-disciplinary and collaborative approach. The digital twin
has great potential for bridging the disciplinary and professional gaps by incorporating data and
insights from multiple sectors, thus fostering stakeholder debates over complex trade-offs.
The project represents an early trial to address the research gap on city-level digital twins. It aims to
develop a digital twin model prototype for examining the potential impacts of digital transformation on
journeys to work in the Cambridge sub-region. The report is organised as follows. Section 2 introduces
the study area. Section 3 discusses the key research outputs. Section 4 summarises the potential
contributions to a digital built Britain through proposing a series of propositions for guiding future
research.
2 Overview of the study area
The core study area for this study is the Cambridgeshire and Peterborough Combined Authority, which
consists of 6 Local authority districts2. Given the relatively large commuting catchment of Cambridge,
the modelling area is expanded to cover the former Greater Cambridge and Greater Peterborough
LEP area, which consists of 14 local authority districts. The study area features the fast-growing
southern areas (i.e. Cambridge and South Cambridgeshire) and the deprived northern areas in the
Fens, which represents a typical UK city region of significant spatial inequality. A map of the study
area is presented in Figure 1.

workers than employed residents, indicating that workers from other local authorities may have to
commute to Cambridge and Peterborough for work.

3 Key research outputs
3.1 Trend in employment growth
The investigation of historic data on employment growth by type (see figure below) shows that, the
part-time employees and the ‘self-employed without employees’ have been growing faster than other
employment types in the Cambridgeshire and Peterborough Combined Authority. Compared with
1981, the number of self-employed without employees has grown 2.6 times and the part-time
employees have nearly doubled in 2011. In particular, the self-employed without employees (who may
be closely related to the ‘gig economy’) see an ever-quicker growth during 2001-2011 in the study
area. The full-time employees, who account for 65% of the workforce in 2011, have seen a steady
growth since 1981. It can be anticipated that the share of part-time workers including both employees
and the self-employed is likely to raise in the study area, supposing the observed trend continues. As
more people start to engage flexible working (e.g. flexible working hours, working from multiple
places), it is important to investigate the associated impacts on the choice of place of work and
journeys to work.

3.2 Understanding the choice of place of work
Our statistical analysis using Census 2011 microdata for the study region confirms that being a self-
employed (either as a freelancer or with employees) is more likely to ‘work at/from home’ or have ‘no
fixed place’ than being an employee, after controlling the cross-sample differences on age, socio-
economic status, industry of work, broad residence location, length of working hours, possible
childcare duty and housing condition (measured by number of persons per room). Specifically, the
positive correlation between the age of individual sample and the choice of working at/from home
indicates a propensity for working at/ from home when workers get old in the study area. Higher socio-
economic status would increase the probability of choosing home working. It suggests that high-skill
jobs (e.g. managerial and professional) are more amenable to working at/from home than relatively
low-skill jobs (e.g. semi-routine and routine). Low-skill jobs are more likely to have ‘no fixed
workplace’. We also find that the choice of home working is subject to the availability of space in the
house – as the number of persons per room increases, i.e. higher occupancy level, the likelihood of
working at/from home decreases in the study region. The interdependence between home working
and housing provision, subject to further tests using up-to-date data, may shed a new light on
understanding worker’s choice of place of work.

3.3 Understanding the mode choice for journeys to work
The figure below shows the mode share for commuting from the CPCA area to Cambridge as the
workplace using 2011 Census data, segmented by a 2-km distance interval. Note that ‘Driving Car’
includes only ‘driving in a car/van’ and exclude commuters who are passengers in car3. The figure also
omits other modes of travel ('motorcycle; scooter or moped', 'taxi' as by Census 2011 definition)4.

It shows that for distance under 6 km, the predominant mode for commuting to Cambridge (including
those commuting within Cambridge) is bicycle (around 45%), followed by walking and driving.
However the mode share for driving increases sharply from 4 km, reaching about 50% for 6-8 km and
a striking 70% for 10-12 km. This is accompanied by the quick drop of bicycle mode – it is not
surprising as cycling over 8 km (about 24 min one-way for an average speed of 20 km/hr) on a daily
basis may become physically undesirable. Less than 10% of commuters use bus for communing
within the 0-4 km range. The share of bus increases from 4 km but is capped around 17% at around
15 km. The share of train for commuting remains under 10% for distance under 27 km, with a spike
around 12-14 km range (e.g. Waterbeach - Cambridge), and increases to about 20% for 26-28 km
(e.g. Newmarket/Royston – Cambridge) and 30-32 km (e.g. Ely – Cambridge).
Given the local policy goal of reducing car  dependence and promote sustainable travel, the shift from
car to bus and other non-motor modes has been the overarching focus in local transport strategy. The
figure below shows the ratio of mode share between bus and car around Cambridge – the purpose of
producing the map is to emphasize the spatial heterogeneity in terms of the mode choice of car and
public transit. To address the desirable shift from car to bus, the 5-15 km commuting distance range is
selected, within which the bus remains a feasible substitute to car for commuting purpose. For
3 Commuters as passengers in car account for about 3.9% of all commuters to Cambridge including those
commuting within Cambridge.
4 All other modes account for about 1.6% of all commuters to Cambridge including those commuting within
Cambridge. The exclusion thus does not change the analysis results significantly.

A red line indicates that there is less than one bus
commuter by every 100 car commuters along the
commuting corridor.
An orange line indicates that there are less than ten
bus commuters by every 100 car commuters.
For major employment sites in central Cambridge, the mode ratio between bus and car is around 0.5-
1.0, indicating that there are more than 50 bus commuters for every 100 car commuters – there is
room for further improvement. For employment sites on the fringe, e.g. Science Park and the
Biomedical Campus, the mode ratio between bus and car is generally under 0.1, indicating less than
ten bus commuters by every 100 car commuters. The empirical finding suggests that, to shift
commuters from car to public transit, the mobility solutions need to be more targeted in relation to
specific locations and commuting corridors, and socio-economic background of commuters. The
spatial and social dimension is very important in policy making, without which the behavioral changes
expected from policy interventions (e.g. shift towards public transit) are difficult to fulfil.

3.4 Insights from a big data set – Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR)
In addition to the conventional data sources, this research taps into a new big data set, namely the
Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) records, to understand the hourly journeys-to-work
patterns in Cambridge. The local authority is acknowledged for providing the anonymized ANPR data.
The ANPR data set applied covers a whole week (Mon-Sun) in June 2017. To link the data with
aggregate Census data, each ANPR camera is assigned to a Middle-layer Super Output Area
(MSOA)5, which is the spatial unit of analysis used in our study. During the one-week data collection
period, around 510,000 vehicles per day can be identified that pass through or stop by Cambridge.
A set of rules are proposed to differentiate commuting cars from non-commuting car journeys (e.g.
tourism and logistics). The following rules are applied for detecting a commuting car, which are
derived from our own tests.
• A broad travel direction towards the city centre, determined by the captured trajectory of the
vehicle;
• First-appearance time stamp between 6am-3pm;
• Duration of stay in Cambridge area no less than five hours.
Based on the rules reported above, approximately 21,000 vehicles per weekday on average are
recognized as commuting vehicles. The following figure depicts the total number of commuting
vehicles in Cambridge by the hour, which includes both stationary and on-road vehicles. It shows that
the total number of commuting cars peaks at noon in Cambridge.
Figure 6 Hourly total number of commuting vehicles in Cambridge (including both stationary and on-road vehicles)
Commuting load by the hour excluding stationary cars can also be obtained from the records (see
Figure 7). The processed data shows that morning peak in Cambridge is between 7-8am, while the
afternoon peak is 4-5pm. The commuting pattern on Friday is slightly different from the other
workdays, with lower volume in both morning and afternoon peak. A detailed investigation into the
Cambridge Biomedical Campus (CBC) yields some local insights (see Figure 8). For instance, majority
of workers at CBC tend to come to work at 7am, leading to a single-point morning peak. However, the
afternoon peak at CBS seems to be more spread than the city as a whole, with more workers remain
at workplace after 5pm. We deem that such a load pattern is related to the particular working schedule

of hospital workers, such as changing shift in the morning. To further understand the pattern, the
mode share by socio-economic group (SEG) at the Cambridge Biomedical Campus (CBC) in Census
2011 is presented in Figure 9. Although the two data are for different years, the composi tion of car
commuters by SEG in 2011 suggests that the SEG4 (semi-routine and routine workers, such as
carers, cleaners) accounts for a rather small share of car users – it is the medium-to-high skill workers
contribute to the observed commuting pattern as revealed by the ANPR data. Cycling seems to be a
privilege for the high-skill workers, which is in line with the findings in London. The low share of bus
implies that, to encourage public transit, local bus services need to be tailored to meet the particular
mobility requirements of CBC workers.

The ANPR data represents one of the emerging big data sources in cities, which sheds a new light on
the spatial-temporal heterogeneity of vehicle use. The typical challenge of working with similar data
(e.g. traffic count data, travel card data) remains – the lack of socio-economic information of the
samples makes it difficult to understand the underlying causes of the observed pattern. Linking the
data with more structured data such as the Census may help address the analytical difficulty.

of the travel data – travel origin, destination, mode, distance/time, social-economic classification,
household profile etc. As proposed in the proposal, a web-based digital platform is developed to
visualize the multi-dimensional journeys to work data. To prepare the data set, we build on the open-
access Census 2011 flow data for the study area, which include origin and destination by travel mode
or National Statistics Socio-economic Classification (NS-SEC)6. The original flow data is then
expanded by adding the breakdown of NS-SEC by mode through an established land-use and
transport model application for the Cambridge sub-region7.  The expanded data set thus include origin,
destination, travel mode and socio-economic classification. The socio-economic segmentation in the
data set, which is aggregated from NS-SEC, is summarized in the table below. From SEG1 to SEG4,
it indicates a decreasing ranking in grade.
6 Detail information about the structure and methodology of NS-SEC can be found at ONS website.
7 The model application is developed for the Cambridgeshire and Peterborough Independent Economic Review
(CPIER) and funded by the Cambridgeshire and Peterborough Combined Authority and Cambridge Ahead. The
CPIER final report, which summarises the model-based policy analysis, can be downloaded here.

Based on the expanded journeys to work data set, a web-based digital platform is developed. Users
can view the commuting flow departing from or arriving to any Middle-layer Super Output Area in the
Cambridge sub-region and examines the breakdown by travel mode and socio-economic group. A

3.6 A digital twin model for simulating future journeys to work
As informed by the workshop outcomes with local authorities, the purpose of the Cambridge Digital
Twin (CDT) model is to bridge the sectoral silos of transport, housing, environment and energy in local
policy making. These policy themes are jointly selected by the local authorities and the research team
as cross-cutting policy issues with local urgency.
The model development follows a policy-oriented approach (see Figure 11). In terms of time horizon,
the proposed CDT prototype is focused on the medium-to-long term policy scenarios. In terms of
modelling scope, the CDT prototype aims to quantify some of the interdependences among transport,
air quality, housing and energy infrastructure in the Cambridge sub-region in relation to background
changes in employment and technology. It has been identified through workshop and interviews that
the future location of businesses, employment, households and their travel choices is the pivot
variable set that connects the selected policy themes.

Figure 11 A policy-outcome-oriented approach for d eveloping the Cambridge digital twin prototype on journeys to work
The CDT pilot is focused on commuting trips (e.g. journeys to work) which is a key determinant of
peak-time travel demand. Based on the journeys to work data, a computational digital twin model is
developed. The proposed digital twin model builds on established transport modelling methods and
incorporates new explanatory variables relating to the type of employment and the built environment.
The modelling workflow is summarized in Figure 12.

The digital twin mode consists of two inter-connected components, the residence location choice
module and the mode choice module. The proposed model builds on established transport modelling
method, and is expanded by adding new location-specific variables relating to local employment
profile (e.g. share of the self-employed/part-time workers), dwelling density and occupancy level.
Statistical analyses are applied to inform the selection of variables. The goodness of fit of the
calibrated mode choice module is presented below.

The calibrated model is then used in forecast mode to produce future journeys to work scenarios in
the study region. Informed by the discussion with local authorities, two future scenarios are proposed
to demonstrate the functionality of the digital twin model, 1) prevalence of teleworking, and 2) future
electric vehicles charging demand, which are introduced in turn below.
Scenario 1: Teleworking
Teleworking or remote working represents a flexible way of working without commuting to a central
workplace. Teleworking enables workers to work from home or other locations for some days of the
week, which thus may reduce the overall commuting demand. One of the key modelling assumptions
pertains to what kinds of employment are amenable to teleworking in the future (see Table 2). It is
assumed that medium-to-high-skill jobs, self-employed jobs and clerical and administrative jobs are
more prone to teleworking. Based on this assumption, the percentage of jobs subject to teleworking in
the study area is summarized in Table 3 – a total of 14% of jobs (about 19,000 jobs based on the
presented employme nt projection for Cambridge) are amendable to teleworking in Cambridge.

16A City-Level Digital Twin Experiment for Exploring the Impacts of Digital Transformation on
Journeys to Work in the Cambridge Sub-region
To test the possible impacts on commuting due to teleworking, a comparative scenario analysis is
conducted. We first run the digital twin model to generate a baseline 2051 scenario for the study
region, using the assumed employment projection summarized in Table 3. The baseline scenario
serves as the basis for comparing the relative changes across scenarios. Recall that the proposed
digital twin model can predict both the residence location choice and the mode choice. In the baseline
scenario, both the residence location and the mode choices are simulated by the model.
Technically the prevalence of teleworking would affect both the residence location choice (for reduced
overall commuting cost per week) and the mode choice (for likely increased flexibility in working
hours). Nonetheless, there is no empirical data available for estimating the elasticity of household
relocation with respect to the reduced weekly commuting cost. We thus do not consider the possible
residence relocation and assume that in the teleworking scenario, all employed residents remain their
original home location as in the baseline scenario. The scenario result is shown in Figure 14.

It shows that the possible impact on commuting is not evenly distributed across the study area. The
teleworking may reduce the journeys to work both within the City and across city boundary. In
particular, the commuting flow from Cambourne, Comberton, Northstowe and Impington to Cambridge
may see a significant reduction. Two policy implications may be drawn from this preliminary impact
study of teleworking on commuting. First, the fast growth of self-employed and part-time workers in the
study area since 1981 suggests that flexible working arrangement such as teleworking may become
prevalent in the study area. The possible impact on journeys to work could be significant in magnitude,
17A City-Level Digital Twin Experiment for Exploring the Impacts of Digital Tra nsformation on
Journeys to Work in the Cambridge Sub-region
which poses new challenges to transport demand forecast. Second, the prevalence of teleworking
may bring radical changes in terms of the relationship between work and location. On the one hand,
the emerging co-working space is blurring the boundary between jobs and workplace – teleworkers
search for a suitable place to work and fill that workspace but not necessarily a job. On the other hand,
planners, developers, architects and employers need to consider new models of providing and
managing workspace (e.g. hotdesking), not simply reducing the floorspace per worker, but considering
the flexibility and adaptability of space and the wider impacts on workers’ productivity and welfare.
Some caveats should be noted. First, literature on tele-/remote working suggests that the reduction of
commuting trips may result in the increase of non-commuting trips, and the total time budget for
travelling in fact remains quite stable over time and among population8. Although teleworking may
reduce the demand for commuting for certain types of jobs, the impact on overall travel demand is not
clear. Second, digital technology is likely to be a key enabler for teleworking – it involves a wide range
of technology, such as cloud platform, immersive technology and the underlying physical infrastructure
such as fibre broadband, mobile connectivity. The teleworking scenario in this study does not consider
the availability of such technology in specific locations.
Scenario 2: Electric vehicles charging demand
The design of this scenario is inspired by one particular finding from the workshops and interviews
with local authorities - replacing the existing combustion-engine vehicles with electric vehicles (EVs) is
deemed as the ultimate solution to air pollution as it addresses the root of the issue. However, the
large-scale take up of EVs is subject to the capacity of local electricity grid, which is already under
considerable strain (e.g. the Addenbrooke’s hospital area). This scenario thus aims to address the
interdependences between the environment, transport, land-use and energy system in local policy
making.
This scenario assumes that all vehicles commuting to Cambridge including those commuting within
Cambridge are EVs. To simplify the energy simulation, we do not differentiate the types of EVs and
assume a uniform electricity consumption per km travelled by EVs (0.151 kWh per km; source: DfT-
WebTAG, 2018, A1.3.8). The electricity charging demand for non-commuting use of EVs is also not
considered. The key policy variable in this scenario is the spatial distribution of future housing and
employment growth in the study region (see Figure 15). A total of three alternative spatial
development strategies are tested, which are in line with the scenario setting in the CPIER report (see
footnote 5 on page 9 for more information about the CPIER report). The digital twin model predicts
how alternative spatial strate gies may affect the distribution of EVs charging demand across the study
region.
The prediction for the 2051 Baseline is presented in Figure 16. To highlight the possible impact of
nudging people in terms of where to charge the EVs, we further assume that all commuting EVs can
only be charged at either workplace or home place. The results for the Densification and the Fringe
Growth are presented in Figure 17 and Figure 18 respectively.

Policy implications of the EVs charging scenario are summarised as follows.
• A high level of spatial variance is observed in the distribution of charging demand for
commuting EVs. The further concentration of employment in Cambridge (as in the
Densification scenario) results in the highest charging demand in Cambridge if commuting EVs
are all charged at workplace.
• Upgrading the energy infrastructure in the dense centre of Cambridge is likely to be expensive
accompanied with severe disruption to local businesses. Nonetheless the increased electricity
demand may be shifted away to other locations in the short term through pro-active pricing
policy on charging and/or parking at workplace, as suggested by the comparison between
100% charging at workplace and home place in the figures. To make it possible, it requires
better collaboration between transport, housing and energy team in local government.
• The feasibility of shirting EVs charging demand between workplace and home place is less in
the Fringe Growth scenario, as  more workers live in proximity to their workplace. The improved
job-housing balance on the fringe also indicates a reduced average commuting distance
compared with the Baseline.
It should be pointed out that the scenario results are rather crude due to the various simplifications in
scenario design. The purpose of this scenario is thus not to provide an engineering solution for
optimizing the distribution of future EVs charging demand, but to demonstrate the potential of city-level
digital simulation tools for facilitating cross-boundary collaboration in policy making in local
government.
4 Potential contributions to a Digital Built Britain
Inspired by the UK National Infrastructure Commission’s recommendation for a national digital twin
and the recent progress of the Digital Framework Task Group and Centre for Digital Built Britain, this
short project explores the concept of a city-level digital twin in terms of the design, development and
application through a modelling case study in Cambridge. In light of the Gemini Principles, this project
also aims to test and verify the high-level principles in a real policy context, and generate transferable
knowledge on city-level digital development.
In additional to the key research outputs discussed in the last section, we summarize a series of
working propositions regarding the development of city-level digital twins, which are derived from the
Cambridge digital twin exercise. An early version of these propositions has been presented on the
2019 International Conference on Smart Infrastructure and Construction (ICSIC) in Cambridge9. It is
expected that these propositions will guide the future research and practice on city-level digital twin
and thus contribute to a Digital Built Britain.
Proposition 1: The upscaling from an engineering digital twin to a city-level digital twin is not
straightforward. For a city-level digital twin application to be useful and the associated discussion to
be meaningful, key dimensions of the digital twin need to be articulated pertaining to the purpose,
boundary, context and resolution of the specific digital twin as well as the interdependences among
twin models. Three dimensions of such are proposed in Figure 19. ‘Policy domains/stakeholders’
denote the subject and representation of the digital twin (i.e. about what and for whom); ‘locational
context’ includes the social, economic, political and geographic background; and ‘spatial-temporal
scale’ indicates the resolution of the twin model.

Proposition 2: Digital twin development is a progressive process; the digital twin and the social
system that creates and uses it must co-evolve with each. This proposition relates to the
intellectual relationship between the digital twin and the human society. On the one hand, our existing
knowledge about cities and societies defines how well we could development and use a city-level
digital twin. On the other hand, artificial intelligence (AI) may eventually become comparable to or
even surpass human intelligence in terms of knowledge production and decision making. In the wake
of recent data misuse and privacy breach incidents (e.g. the Cambridge Analytica case), the co-
evolving proposition addresses the imperative for harnessing the power of AI through pre-emptive
measures.
Proposition 3: Real time is a relative term. The temporal scale of the digital twin should reflect
the rate of change of the subject in reality. The real-time feature as in engineering digital twin
applications denotes the low latency in updating the twin model against the reality. The transition from
a manufacturing product as the subject of a digital replica to a city entails the term ‘real time’ to be
redefined. It contests to the simplistic pursuit of high-frequency data regardless of the purpose of the
digital twin.
Proposition 4: To advance the city-level digital twin agenda, digital twin applications should be
focused on enabling more frequent and effective feedback loop between the twin model,
stakeholders and the public. One major problem of using urban computational models in policy
making is the lack or inefficiency of feedback, which can manifest itself in various ways, e.g. model as
a ‘black box’, no post-analysis validation and the detachment from public engagement. From a
modelling perspective, the implication is that the interaction between the model and the users is far
from perfect even for modelling experts. New interface thus needs to be explored which can translate
data analytics into cogent narratives targeted to various stakeholders. To achieve it, modellers may
have to think beyond models, which is apparently more than a technical request.
Proposition 5: To help solving complex policy challenges, a realistic use of a city-level digital
twin is to identify system-level risks and inefficiencies of policy interventions and to foster
cross-disciplinary/professional collaboration, as opposed to providing a singular model-based
22A City-Level Digital Twin Experiment for Exploring the Impacts of Digital Transformation on
Journeys to Work in the Cambridge Sub-region
optimization. System-level optimization, though being the explicit purpose of some digital twins in the
engineering sphere, may not be an effective approach to address “wicked” urban problems. One of the
reasons is that developers of the digital twin, given their technical background, often do not have
enough understanding of the non-tec hnical factors (e.g. election cycles, hierarchies of decision
making, institutional constraints). These non-technical factors are usually highly influential but tend to
be very difficult to be incorporated in the model. A model-based optimization which does not consider
such non-technical constraints would have little meaning.
It should be noted that these propositions are neither conclusive nor exhaustive. It is expected that the
propositions could be further tested and expanded through more empirical research.
Conclusions
The digital twin technology represents one of the latest technical trends for smartening our cities.
However the roadmap to develop a city-/national-level digital twin is not yet clear. This project
represents a timely effort to explore a policy-oriented strategy for developing a city-level digital twin
prototype for the Cambridge sub-region. Key research outputs are discussed and a series of
propositions are proposed for guiding the future research on city-level digital twin.
The project is nothing but a small step towards the ambition of creating a national digital twin for the
UK infrastructure. It is expected that more and more empirical evidence will be gathered to establish a
new body of knowledge for leveraging and regulating the power of digital twins. As discussed in one of
the propositions, the development of a digital twin is a progressive process, where the digital twin and
the social system that creates and uses it must co-evolve with each. Much remains to be done.

The finance industry has long been at the forefront of using data and technology
to make better decisions, to de-risk, to improve return on investments, and to
create better outcomes. Tackling the big challenges of our day – climate change
and resilience, energy, healthcare – relies on having the right technologies and
data to make the right interventions.
At Centre for Digital Built Britain (CDBB), we have seen how digital twins can
improve decision-making in the planning, design, build, and operation of assets.
We have also seen the benefits of connecting digital twins across organisations
and sectors. The finance community has a huge opportunity to realise the
benefits of digital twins by using them to add value, track sustainability targets,
attract new investments, and manage risk better. However, collaboration across
the industry is key. When we collaborate, across boundaries, across borders, we
can do amazing things. We can make better business decisions that drive better
economic, social, and environmental outcomes.
On behalf of CDBB, I would like to thank everyone involved in this paper;
Mark Coates and Bentley Systems for their leadership, which was key to
making this paper a reality; and all who so generously shared their expertise,
experience, and knowledge.
I am excited to see how the finance community will join with the wider
infrastructure community and solution providers to use higher quality data
and digital twins to improve investment returns, meet ESG goals, and create
the sustainable future we all want to see.
How Finance and Digital Twins Can Shape a Better Future for the PlanetDIGITAL TWINS1
Centre for Digital Built Britain (CDBB) describes a digital twin as “a digital representation of an asset,
system, or process.”
What distinguishes a digital twin from any other digital model is its connection to the physical twin.
Based on data from the physical asset or system, a digital twin unlocks value by supporting improved
decision-making, which creates the opportunity for positive feedback into the physical twin.
A digital twin can be:
• dynamic, capturing current performance data
from the physical twin, or
• static, a model of a system, with input of
long-term condition data from the physical
twin via corporate reporting systems and the
capital investment process.

the Future of Digital Twins
At the heart of the Transforming Infrastructure Performance Programme lies the
need for a step change in productivity. […] It will require data from all parts of the
syste m to inform decision-making, from improved information management in
delivery to the creation of digital twins for asset maintenance and optimisation.
Nick Smallwood, CEO, Infrastructure and Projects Authority2
In recent years, there has been an explosion of interest in the potential role of digital twins in the
transformation of how infrastructure and the built environment are planned, designed, constructed,
and operated.
Modern digital approaches are at the heart of an emerging government-industry change programme
captured in the work of the Centre for Digital Built Britain (CDBB) and in key documents, such as the
Construction Playbook3, Transforming Infrastructure Performance Road Map to 2030, and the Gemini Papers.4
During the five years of the CDBB programme, we have seen a step change in the quality of the dialogue
between industry, academia, and the public sector. It has created a greater shared understanding of the use
cases and benefits of digital twins at all stages of the asset lifecycle, as well as having unlocked increased
investment in digital solutions that have generated ever more economic, social, and environmental benefits.
The catalyst for this paper was to ask if the same has been true for the dialogue between an increasingly
tight-knit industry, driving the digital transformation of infrastructure, and the investors, insurers, banks,
and other institutions who provide much of their funding and finance.
To answer this question, we have spoken with a wide range of investors to get a better understanding
of how and why they are currently using infrastructure-related data, as well as their level of knowledge
and interest in the potential of digital twins.
Our conclusion is that there is huge untapped potential for investors to influence how data is used to
improve infrastructure decision-making—and that taking on a greater role in the digital transformation
of infrastructure will provide better outcomes for businesses, people, and nature.
There is also a significant opportunity to leverage digital twins to support key challenges facing the finance
community: where to allocate capital; screening and managing risk; enhancing asset value by improving
performance and reliability; and complying with environmental, social, and governance (ESG) requirements.
The key to unlocking this potential is to apply the fundamentals of the information value chain.
The finance community can collaborate with the wider industry to develop practical use cases that
help them use the insights derived from data to solve their most pressing problems, make better decisions,
and create more value.
The infrastructure sector needs to play its part and approach this dialogue with openness and flexibility.
Infrastructure professionals need to understand that investors generate their return on investment (ROI) in a
variety of ways, via different types of assets and at different stages of the infrastructure lifecycle. Some of their
use cases overlap with those al ready developed for supply chain businesses or operators while others will not.
In the remainder of this paper, we set out three steps for improving the quality of the dialogue between
investors and other parts of the infrastructure sector, re-imagine the information value chain from an investor’s
perspective, explore how investors can expand their leadership role, and share some use cases investors are
currently pursuing.
Finally, in the spirit of encouraging dialogue and collaboration, the paper ends with a series of open questions
that we hope will kick-start a debate that will bring investors into the heart of the effort to digitally transform
infrastructure performance.
How Finance and Digital Twins Can Shape a Better Future for the PlanetIMPROVING COLLABORATION BETWEEN THE FINANCE COMMUNITY
AND THE WIDER INFRASTRUCTURE SECTOR
STEP 1 – UNDERSTANDING THE VARIETY OF INFRASTRUCTURE
INVESTORS AND WHAT THAT MEANS FOR THE DIFFERENT WAYS
THAT THEY CAN BENEFIT FROM DIGITAL TWINS
The first step to bringing investors into the heart of the debate on digital twin adoption is simply to recognise
that they are not a homogeneous, undifferentiated group.
Infrastructure investor is a broad term that embraces a range of institutions that invest in the debt or equity
of infrastructure assets or businesses. Investors may fund the construction of new (greenfield) assets or acquire
operational (brownfield) assets.
There are numerous types of infrastructure investors pursuing a variety of strategies to achieve ROI.
• Private equity firms and asset managers typically invest pools of funds on behalf of institutional investors,
such as pension funds, insurers, or sovereign wealth funds. Funds will hold these stakes for different lengths
of time, depending on their investment strategy, but it will normally be at least three to five years. Fund
managers use their expertise to support asset managers to maximise performance, revenues, and re-sale
value. They will normally receive an annual management fee based on the value of the fund and be entitled

• Institutional investors (pension and/or sovereign wealth funds) may also employ their own

as Abu Dhabi and Singapore.

their entirety by private markets. Development banks are typically set up by governments or non-profit
organisations and normally operate to policy mandates, setting out the social, economic, and environmental
objectives to be supported by the bank’s activities. Examples include the European Bank for Reconstruction
and Development. The new U.K. Infrastructure Bank has many of the characteristics of a development bank
and is providing GBP 22 billion of finance to support climate change and levelling up objectives.
• Others key stakeholders include insurers, advisors, and guarantee providers.
How Finance and Digital Twins Can Shape a Better Future for the PlanetSTEP 2 – UNDERSTANDING HOW INVESTORS
CATEGORISE INFRASTRUCTURE
A second step is to understand how digital twins are likely to relate to how the finance community
typically categorises infrastructure. Many investors divide the sector into four categories of opportunities
(see figure below7).

How Finance and Digital Twins Can Shape a Better Future for the PlanetSTEP 3 – RELATING DIGITAL TWIN USE CASES TO
DIFFERENT INVESTOR STRATEGIES
A third step is to link potential use cases for digital twins to how investors build investment strategies.
At the most basic level, infrastructure is seen as an attractive investment because it offers stable, reliable
returns, often backed by a government counterparty. In times of economic uncertainty, investments in real
physical assets that provide essential, government-supported services are unsurprisingly particularly attractive.
Behind that general rule, however, lies a variety of approaches to generating an acceptable ROI. Figure below
(Source: Preqin8) shows how the four categories of infrastructure can form the basis of strategies based
on expected ROI, risk appetite, and the balance between generating returns from maximising  revenues or
profits from the re-sale of assets.

Social Infrastructure
REIMAGINING THE INFORMATION VALUE CHAIN FOR INVESTORS
The use cases for a digital twin will vary for different types of infrastructure investors pursing
different strategies.
The fundamentals of building a use case for deriving value from data are, however, no different for
investors than for any other organisation.
Collecting data has no inherent value. It must be used to make better decisions that lead to improved
outcomes. Sense-making is needed to convert data into insights that can support this process.
This simple idea can be captured in the information value chain.
The figure above sets out how the information value chain could look for infrastructure investors.

ESG: THE BIGGEST DATA CHALLENGE FOR THE FINANCE COMMUNITY?
The U.K. government has set out detailed plans for Greening Finance to support its ambitious
2050 net-zero carbon target.
The plan includes the Sustainability Disclosure Requirements announced by the Chancellor in July 2021.
In October 2021, the Chancellor also confirmed that the U.K. will adopt in full the recommendations
of the Task Force on Climate Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD).
The goal is to ensure that the financial flows across the economy shift to align with the net-zero
commitment and wider sustainability goals.

The Sustainable Disclosure Requirements will create a single integrated framework for “decision useful”
disclosures on ESG related issues.
It will cover three categories of disclosures:
1. Corporate Disclosures: Requirements for companies, including financial services businesses
to make sustainability disclosures. This reporting will adhere to agreed international standards.
2. Asset Manager and Asset Owner Disclosures: New requirements for asset managers and asset
owners (including occupational pension schemes) to disclose how they take sustainability into
account in their decision-making.
3. Investment Product Disclosure: New requirements for creators of investment products to report
on the products’ sustainability impact and relevant financial risks and opportunities. This information
will also form the basis of a new sustainable investment labelling regime.
How Finance and Digital Twins  Can Shape a Better Future for the Planet 8In addition, despite Brexit, the EU Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation will affect anyone raising
money from investors inside the EU, and there are signs that the U.S. is moving in a similar direction.
In a recent article on Infrastructure’s ESG Revolution,6 Gordon Bajnai, head of global infrastructure
at private equity business Campbell Lutyens, summed up the current situation. “Sectors such as energy
and transportation have a measurable impact on our efforts to decarbonise the world, while sectors
such as digital have a huge role to play in bridging divides in society. ESG measument, reporting,
and benchmarking have become standard in infrastructure. If you want to raise money, these things
are must-haves and not nice-to-have.”
This situation is creating a big demand for processes and technology to monitor, measure, and report
on ESG risks across an investor’s portfolio. It also means that ESG assessments are playing a greater role
in due diligence processes for lending, as well as for the buying and selling of assets by equity investors.
Unfortunately, as a recent survey published by Preqin demonstrates, the finance community
is being held back by a lack of consistent, high-quality data.

The need for a step change in the quality and usefulness of ESG-related data looks like one of the greatest
information challenges facing the finance community—and perhaps the single biggest use case for a
digital twin that can create a bridge between financial data, physical assets, and the natural environment.
HOW CAN INVESTORS TAKE A MORE ACTIVE LEADERSHIP ROLE?
It is necessary for the infrastructure sector to improve how it engages with infrastructure investors.
In fact, it is vital if we want those investors to play a bigger role in driving the roll out of digital twins
of built environment assets.
Investors themselves need to take the initiative and use their leverage to encourage creating
digital twins in ways that align to their interests.
Talking with investors, it was once again clear that different types of investors have different opportunities
to take this leadership role. One way to think about this is through the lens of investors’ different
relationships with the organisations planning, constructing, and maintaining infrastructure assets.
How Finance and Digital Twins Can Shape a Better Future for the PlanetDebt – Incentivising the creation of be tter-quality data
Banks providing debt to infrastructure businesses or project-based special purpose vehicles have a very
transactional relationship. They lend money to support the creation, expansion, and maintenance of assets,
and then receive repayment at an agreed rate of interest in an agreed upon time frame.
These loans are normally secured against assets, and lenders have first call on their revenues or resale value
if things do not go according to plan. However, they will not receive any share of the upside if the assets
outperform. Therefore, lenders’ opportunities to influence digitalisation are generally shorter term and linked
to their need to de-risk lending and meet their reporting and regulatory requirements as efficiently as possible.
One public-private partnership (PPP) equity investor talked us through how they used a spatial-temporal
digital twin developed for a mega-project to demonstrate to their banks that risks were being managed
effectively during the construction and commissioning phase. This technology allowed the investor to secure
market-leading rates from the consortia of banks, providing the debt finance for the project.
We are also aware of cases like that of Great Portland Estates (GPE)5, who in 2020 signed a GBP 450 million,
ESG-linked, revolving credit facility (RCF) as part of its plan to become net zero by 2030. This innovative facility,
the first to be issued by a U.K. real estate investment trust, incorporates three ESG-linked key performance
indicators (KPIs), aligned to GPE’s sustainability strategy.
These KPIs include annual pre-agreed targets and are based on:
• Supporting GPEs target to decarbonise its existing buildings and reducing the energy
intensity of its portfolio by 40% by 2030
• Supporting GPEs target to build net-zero carbon new buildings from 2030
• Providing better quality urban greening measures by increasing biodiversity across GPEs portfolio
GPE’s lenders have agreed that a decrease or increase of up to 2.5 basis points will be applied to their
headline margin based on performance against the KPIs.
In both cases, the bank’s goals were not to drive the digital transformation of buildings and infrastructure.
These targets incentivise GPE to accelerate the decarbonisation of their business and will support continued
behavioural change across their supply chain.
However, it is easy to see how the existence and use of high-quality, up-to-date data linked to the physical
assets increased their confidence that construction was being de-risked and that ESG KPIs were being met.
These examples demonstrate that there is a case for big lenders to get on the front foot and be more vocal
about the digital information that they want to see alongside the physical assets that they are financing—
and translate it into competitive interest rates and other returns.
As one interviewee told us, “When people price big infrastructure jobs, they price what they don’t know.
As the information improves, they’ll have  to ‘go lean’ because the risks are known.”
Equity – Maximising the value of assets
Equity investors, on the other hand, usually take a higher risk but share in increased revenues during the
lifetime of their investment and can sell on their stakes at a profit. Therefore, their business model typically
already involves working closely with owners and operators on improvement plans. This situation opens
up many more opportunities to drive progress, including through digital transformation initiatives.
It is particularly true for investors with larger portfolios, often spread across many counties. One such investor
explained to us how they sought to ensure at least a base level of digitisation across the businesses in which
they had equity stakes, telling us:
“If you have two wind farms, and one has some form of digital twin and one just a PDF with some annual
performance reporting, it’s obvious that, for the owner and their engineers, the former is less risky and it
is clearer where we can add value. Then, when it comes to re-sale, assets that have a transparent life history
are more transactionable.”
How Finance and Digital Twins Can Shape a Better Future for the PlanetThis investor explained that they helped local managers to exploit the benefits of being part of the fund’s
portfolio; for example, helping a smaller local utility in one country work with larger businesses in the same
sector to access digital expertise and share knowledge.
The construction and infrastructure sectors have, for decades, talked about the importance of intelligent
clients. Many of the equity investors that we spoke with talked about the importance of being an intelligent
shareholder, a big part of which is having plans to increase the digital maturity of their assets.
Government – Catalysing data sharing for the public good
One final category of investor that has a leadership role to play is government. The public sector provides
much of the finance that goes into the U.K.’s infrastructure.
Many of the wider benefits from better infrastructure data derive not solely from digital twins of individual
assets, but also from the ability to share data safely and securely across organisational and sectoral
boundaries. To realise the systematic benefits of better data and connected digital twins, governments
must play a catalysing, convening, connecting, and co-ordinating role, as demonstrated by such initiatives
as the CDBB’s own National Digital Twin programme and the National Infrastructure Commission’s
Data for the Public Good9 study.
Our interviews highlighted several intriguing opportunities for government.
Seeing benefits The government of Queensland in Australia is sponsoring the Cross River Rail project to build a new
10.2-kilometer rail line in Brisbane. Influenced by its conversations with the U.K. Crossrail Project, Cross River

certain areas and make investments in the right infrastructure. Our view is that the model has the potential
technology. to form the basis of a city-wide digital twin, a connected ecosystem, that can deliver benefits by supporting
investment decision-making on a city-wide basis. This type of digital twin would deliver value greater than the
sum of its parts, especially in the run up to Brisbane’s hosting of the 2032 Olympics. Other publicly funded
mega-projects have leeway in their budgets to make these kind of anchor investments. They can also use their
influence to establish de-facto norms for data management and interoperability.
Elsewhere, investors are looking to exploit public data sets that might not normally be associated with an
infrastructure digital twin. We spoke to one investor who is exploring how they could align their in-house
corporate data with public data sets relating to measures such as educational attainment, crime, and local
economic development. This application would open opportunities for investors to demonstrate how their
activity was contributing to policy goals, with the potential for more effective allocation of resources and the
creation of new income streams for investors. The quality, accuracy, and accessibility of these data sets
remain a barrier to realising this vision, despite the efforts of the Office of National Statistics, Cabinet Office,7
and others. However, our investor was convinced that if government worked to make better quality data
openly available, private sector players would lean in and develop new solutions to help meet national
goals like net zero.
What kind of use cases are investors interested in? In our conversations with different types of investors,
we heard about a variety of current and potential use cases. Here are just a few examples.
How can I use data and digital maturity to help increase the value of assets? While equity investors
have different strategies for how long they want to hold on to assets, they will look to sell on at a profit at
some point. Several interviewees told us that they are developing strategies to ensure that assets are more
digitally mature at re-sale. They are confident that it provides an objective demonstration of high performance
and reduced risk that will increase re-sale value. Enhanced performance will also increase revenues during the
period of ownership and can help crowd in further value enhancing investment.
How Finance and Digital Twins Can Shape a Better Future for the PlanetHow can I use data and digital maturity to screen ESG impacts and comply with regulations?
Multinational development banks explained to us  that they have a fundamental need to demonstrate the
impact of their investments against a variety of economic, social, and environmental metrics. They told
us that they are exploring actively how digital technologies can improve the efficiency and transparency of
how impact is measured.
We also heard from investors in social and economic infrastructure about an opportunity to go beyond ESG
reporting and open up potential new revenue streams by demonstrating a direct correlation between their
investments and government policy goals, such as crime reduction or educational attainment. These investors
are looking to work with digital specialists to blend publicly available data such as crime figures with their own
in-house data.
More broadly, investors also face a host of ESG and safety-related reporting requirements, these
demands are creating one of the most powerful use cases amongst investors for better data.
Safety
The Grenfell Tower tragedy has ushered in a renewed focus from government and regulators on the
safety of higher risk buildings.
The Buildings Safety Act is expected to receive royal assent in the first half of 2022, with significant changes
to duties around risk management being phased in over the subsequent 18-month period.
The act builds on the findings of Dame Judith Hackitt’s review of building regulations and fire safety.
Dame Judith recommended the introduction of a “robust golden thread of key information to allow all parties
to use information to safely and effectively design, construct, and operate their buildings.” She stated that
this data must be passed to future building owners to underpin more effective safety management. The
recommendations and the subsequent legislation are intended to address the problems within the industry
of vital information not being effectively managed—or sometimes not even available in a usable form—
to ensure that the right people have the information that they need to ensure the safety of buildings.
The act also requires that the data be used to create a safety case owned by an accountable person.
In practice, it means accountable persons—normally, the landlord or freeholder—will need to demonstrate
that risks have been identified and assessed, and that a credible plan is in place to reduce or control them to
an appropriate level. These plans must be maintained, and regular reports must be submitted to regulators.
How can I optimise energy performance? Real estate equity investors told us that improving energy
performance was the single most appealing use case for digital twins in their world. Success would tick ESG
and carbon reduction boxes, while promising to enhance ROI via performance improvements and enhanced
user experience. These investors are actively exploring how scenario modelling and analysis can help identify
the interventions with the greatest energy performance benefits.
How can I mitigate risks created by bad data? The Grenfell Tragedy is educating the whole built
environm ent sector on the human, reputational, legal, and financial risks created by poor or incomplete data.
The Building Safety Act will be phased in over the next 18 months, introducing the requirement to maintain
a golden thread of asset information through the lifetime of the highest risk buildings. It shows how better
data practices, up to and including the creation of digital twins, can mitigate the risks created by poor data,
which is an increasingly compelling use case for many investors.
How Finance and Digital Twins Can Shape a Better Future for the PlanetHow can I maximise my income from availability payments? Many investors have revenue streams
tied to payment mechanisms based on performance standards, such as lane availability on their roads or
classrooms heated in their schools. These investors are pursuing use cases for digital twins that help investors
maximise revenue by ensuring operational teams are alerted when action is needed to head off any drop in
service levels. This data can also provide a historic record of performance useful for proving compliance with
contractual obligations over the course of the contract.
How can I reduce my cost of capital? One PPP investor talked us through how they used a spatial-temporal
digital twin developed for a mega-project to demonstrate to banks that the construction and commissioning
risks were being managed effectively by the project delivery team. This situation allowed them to secure
market leading rates from the consortia of banks providing the debt finance for the project.
MOVING THE CONVERSATION FORWARD
The goal of this white paper has been to kick-start a dialogue that can bring infrastructure investors
closer to the centre of efforts driving digital transformation of the infrastructure sector.
Instead of finishing with a traditional conclusion, we decided to convert some of the themes explored
throughout the paper into a series of questions that initiate that conversation. These questions are by no
means an exhaustive list, and we are very happy to be told other questions are more important. The key,
however, is to start the conversation.

set some shared challenges?
As we have seen, there are many use cases already being explored by infrastructure investors.
Can a dialogue between the investor community and the infrastructure sector reach consensus on
what are the most pressing and promising? Can we set some shared challenges? What level of digital
information will really be needed to serve them? Is visualization the requirement or can needs be met,
at least in the first instance, by something simpler?
Should a digital maturity assessment be a standard part of investors’ due
diligence process?
We heard from several investors who have developed simple metrics to assess the digital maturity of
the people and organisations in which they are investing. They help with risk assessment and identifying
opportunities for adding value to the assets and barriers to their realisation. Should these steps become
a much more standard part of the due diligence process? Is there a role for non-commercial players
like CDBB and its successors to help codify and standardise digital maturity?
The sophistication of an infrastructure owner’s cyber security measures will be a key metric in any
digital maturity assessment. One development bank told us that many of the projects that they invest in
form part of developing countries’ critical national infrastructure. Supporting the digitalisation of these
nations’ energy grid or similar projects not only delivers real economic, social, and environmental benefits,
but also increases vulnerability to cyber-attacks. In response, the bank has taken a very top-down approach
to using its leverage to improve data security and standards, as well as ensuring that the maturity exists
to maintain them over time.
How Finance and Digital Twins Can Shape a Better Future for the PlanetIn the commercial market, we heard that fears about the additional complexity and risk created by
cyber-security can be a barrier to investors embracing digital innovation. How can solution providers
and the finance community collaborate more effectively to deal with the challenges of cyber-security?
Are there lessons that can be transferred from development banking into the commercial sector?
What will make providers of debt offer competitive interest rates for
assets with digital twins?
We heard from one investor who had secured highly competitive terms from banks that are providing debt
for a greenfield mega-project. The use of digital twins to de-risk the construction phase played a key role.
We know that some banks have been willing to offer competitive rates to projects demonstrating performance
against ESG targets, something that generates a strong use case for comprehensive asset and performance
data. Can we  encourage banks to be more proactive in offering competitive lending terms to projects
utilising digital twin technology to address these risks and opportunities? Are there other motivations that
the sector could tap into?
What more can governments do to help?
Cross River Rail in Brisbane is an example of where a publicly sponsored mega-project can provide
the catalyst for a city-level digital twin that can support better investment decisions.
As it’s the We also heard that some of the most useful data sets for building a use case are those held by governments
or agencies. It can include data needed to assess the impact of investments, such as changes to crime rates,
operational
educational attainment, and economic development. Unfortunately, many of these data sets are patchy
results that or out of date. Can government be encouraged to tackle this problem and then to challenge the industry
to lean into this data to drive progress towards big policy goals like levelling up and net zero?

to engage. THE TAKEAWAYS
The goal of this white paper has been to kick-start a dialogue that can bring infrastructure investors
closer to the centre of efforts driving digital transformation of the infrastructure sector.
The Value of Information Management in the Construction and Infrastructure Sector report estimated that
every GBP 1 invested in information management could potentially secure up to GBP 6 of labour time savings,
all while boosting government efforts to reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. Five takeaways are
proposed to advance digital twins and unlock their benefits for the finance community:
1. Adopt the Gemini Principles in your digital strategies: CDBB is calling on leaders involved in managing
and investing in the built environment to build the Gemini Principles into their digital strategies. The principles
enable a values-based approach for the development of digital twins and alignment for organisations.
2. Digital twins to support ESG reporting: There is a great data challenge facing the finance community
in terms of access, accuracy, and consistency of data. This challenge is on the critical path for ESG reporting.
Digital twins should be built on high-quality data, and there is large overlap between data required for
ESG reporting and data needed for managing of assets. Advancing the use of digital twins will drive better
data quality and improve chances for timely ESG reporting.
3. Open data to unlock its value: Data has value in isolation, and an increased value is realised when
it is shared and connected. Open data does not mean that everyone has access to the data, but rather
means that data is shareable within the ecosystem of partners, clients, and the supply chain. According
to the Gemini Principles, data must be as open as possible while remaining consistent with the principles
of holistic security to create maximum value for everyone. Including data from many sources is essential
to maximising value  of digital twins.
4. Assess and upskill digital capabilities: The changes brought by digitisation are driving a need for
new services across the industry, such as cyber resilience, data engineering, data science, and software
development. Organisations in the finance community should assess digital capabilities and upskill
as required to ensure a resilient and productive value chain that is fit for the future.
How Finance and Digital Twins Can Shape a Better Future for the Planet5. Collaborate: The finance community is core to the infrastructure industry and is positioned to reap
benefits of better communication and information sharing across the industry. Established communities
like the Digital Twin Hub are a great place to shape the future of digital twins in the industry by sharing
success stories and lessons learned, as well as connect to others involved with digital twins.
CDBB has worked closely with the industry, academia, and the government to explore and create solutions
for the challenges facing the built environment. The Gemini Papers present their learnings from the past five
years, capturing the consensus viewpoint of the connected digital twin community and serving as a blueprint
for future leaders. The finance community is in a strong position to lead the industry forward.
NEXT STEPS – JOIN THE CONVERSATION
This white paper is one of the final pieces from the Centre for Digital Built Britain, which completes its mission
at the end of March 2022. However, many of its activities will continue, including the Digital Twin Hub,
which has created a community of infrastructure professionals who are committed to change.
As members of that community, we are committed to working with colleagues to bring investors
into the mainstream of the movement and to drive the digital transformation of the infrastructure sector,
creating better outcomes for people and the planet.
If you would like to be part of that effort or have views on any of the questions or issues raised in
this paper, we would love to hear from you. You can get in touch via the Digital Twin Hub or reach out
to us individually on LinkedIn.
We look forward to hearing from you.

In alliance with:Develop a disruptive mindset
and designs the digital strategy for
your organization.About the Program
68% of CEOs express some type of concern about achieving success in
the implementation of digital transformation in their organizations, leading
in many cases to only develop a “digitalization of processes”, which is
very far from what said transformation truly means.
On the other hand, the situation that the world is currently experiencing has made the
virtualization and digitalization of processes within companies is
imminent, and the understanding of the entire digital ecosystem, of the new
work methodologies and their cultural adoption are part of the challenges they have
managers and executives.
And these elements make up the purpose of this course, providing a vision
strategic and managerial on the fundamentals of digital transformation and
implementation in organizations. Objective
This program seeks to provide managers, businessmen and directors of organizations
from different economic sectors, the knowledge and foundations about
digital transformation, helping them develop key competencies for design
strategic and effective implementation.
Likewise, it is expected to develop solid leadership in the participants to achieve
a cultural change, which involves the implementation of new methodologies to enable
innovation processes, under a demanding provision that stimulates experimentation,
taking risks and capitalizing on learning. In addition, to promote the
transformation of traditional thinking into a disruptive one, focused on
value proposition and customer experience.
In conclusion, we want to train digital leaders and not followers. Additionally, you will have the
opportunity to interact with executives from all over Latin America, which will enrich the
conversations and experiences during the development of the training. Module 1: Digital Mindset

4Change Models
A change model is used to describe how an organization adapts in a dynamic environment to
stay profitable. There are four types of change models: realization, renewal, extension and trajectory. A model of
Realization seeks to exploit the full potential of the current business, rather than a change in the model, it uses strategies to optimize its
operation with the same resources, generally, their strategies are geographic expansion and growth of the customer base. A
renewal model seeks to revitalize its products, platforms and operations, either by creating new products or services or
developing new capabilities and attacking new markets. An extension model seeks to expand industries to monopolize
new unexplored market segments, functions and operations, existing product lines are not changed, but rather
They add new ones which means the business model generally becomes broader. A trajectory model means a
new business model, this drastic change is a response to a drastic change in the environment. These changes are
crucial for the survival of a company over time.

Business Model Functions
A business model functions as a framework to integrate internal and external elements of a company, in order to
obtain economically favorable results. The functions of a business model are to articulate the value proposition, identify
market segments, define the value chain structure, estimate the cost structure and revenue potential, describe its
position in a value network and formulate the competitive strategy. The process to design a business model consists of defining a
value proposition that solves a problem, with a defined product, the way the customer would use it and how big that is
problem for the client. The market segment depends on the problem that the value proposition solves and they are the ones that are
willing to pay to solve that problem. The value chain is extremely important because n or is it enough to create

Traditional bank vs digital bank
Before describing the business model of our case study, we will highlight the differences between a traditional bank and a
digital bank, this will help us understand the phenomenon of fintech and the digital transformation of banks.

man from the beginning of his history, without However, money has also been evolving and is becoming less and less necessary.

Fintech came to transform the financial sector, forcing traditional businesses to adapt or die.
It is increasingly common for traditional banks to create strategies with a high technological component, to
maintain their clients and prevent them from migrating to Fintech alternatives, it is also worth highlighting that Fintech
They enter the market with attractive conditions for the client, as in the case of NuBank and FC, which do not charge commissions
to the client for managing their money, contrary to what happens with traditional banks. Another phenomenon to take into account
The main thing is that Fintech makes products more accessible to all sectors of the population, reducing the
barriers to entry requested by a traditional bank and simplifying procedures. Thus increasing the rate of
banking of the population.
FC, despite entering the business recently, already has recognition and a large user base, seeks
become a digital bank and for this, it is launching pr oducts once a year, future work is
then the consulting process for the development of your next product, which will be a virtual wallet, the end
The last of this is for this virtual wallet to function as a savings account, and thus begin to offer the
products offered by a bank.
Finally, we can conclude that new business models emerge from existing models. In the present,
The new business models that emerge have a high technological component and even depend on the
technology to function, as is the case of Uber or Airbnb, for this reason, we can say with complete certainty that the
financial sector in the not too distant future, will depend on technology as happened with the
advertising or entertainment, and even the figure of cash will be eliminated.References
