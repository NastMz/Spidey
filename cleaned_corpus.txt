the initiative was presented to the university community and its main purpose is to contribute to the digital transformation and the development of this technology impacting chile and latin america on the occasion the academiaia platform was shared which includes learning resources as well as information about events and tools always related to the use of artificial intelligence conect ia is the name of the new collaborative alliance developed by the catholic university and microsoft as its motto indicates the purpose of this initiative is to promote artificial intelligence in chile and also in latin america in a presentation held in the uc hall of honor the progress of this joint work was shared with the university community and academiaia was presented a free platform for those who study teach and work at this higher education institution and which includes resources and tools for the use of artificial intelligence ai artificial intelligence is one of the most transformative technologies of our time it has the potential to improve people s quality of life generate new knowledge and solutions to the most complex problems of our society and create new opportunities for economic and social development said uc rector ignacio sánchez the university authority valued the strategic alliance that has been articulated with microsoft a world leading company in technological development and emphasized that as a university committed to our society and academic excellence the catholic university cannot be left out of this technological revolution but it must be a leading actor and a regional reference in the development and research of artificial intelligence as well as in its responsible application to the various areas of our university mission the uc development plan has digital transformation among its main axes it is a process that seeks to enable people to interact directly with technology and data and also adopt a culture that takes advantage of the benefits of this transformation one of the challenges is also to increasingly integrate these technologies in teaching practices in research and also in organizational management as a university committed to our society and academic excellence the catholic university cannot be left out of this technological revolution but must be a leading actor and a regional reference in the development and research of artificial intelligence ignacio sánchez rector of the uc the prorector of the uc guillermo marshall who has been one of the main promoters of the conectia project maintained that the effects of this initiative can also be very significant in the educational field this alliance allows us to be protagonists and leader it is a technological revolution whose scope is difficult to measure today it is very likely that this will imply in the very near future reviewing the academic programs the teaching learning processes and the forms of evaluation for our students he stated this alliance allows us to be protagonists and leaders of a technological revolution whose scope they are today difficult to size it is very likely that this will imply in the very near future reviewing the academic programs the teaching learning processes and the forms of evaluation for our students guillermo marshall uc pro rector incorporating ai in education entities bruce thompson director of microsoft education for the americas and an expert in technological matters spoke about how higher education institutions today can efficiently take advantage of artificial intelligence sharing different international examples and initiatives artificial intelligence is going to change the way students receive information which has an impact on the curriculum and instructional design he stated he highlighted that in order to get the maximum potential out of ai it is important to unite the institutional strategy with the technological one which requires overcoming different challenges and also incorporating cultural changes prone to the adoption of these technologies in this sense the manager explained that it is essential to define specific objectives in the incorporation of artificial intelligence as well as goals at the level of academic units and central entities of the university administration artificial intelligence is going to change the way students receive information which has an impact on the curriculum and instructional design bruce thompson director of education microsoft for the americas for the incorporation of ai within the university thompson maintained that it is relevant to provide guidelines and aids to facilitate learning for example teaching how to ask precise questions to artificial intelligence tools so that they provide correct answers on the other hand he emphasized hackathons as another way to promote the introduction of ai in which students with programming knowledge manage to create solutions for certain challenges that are proposed to them the director stated that the uc through its leadership can also become a reference for both chile and the region on these issues to the extent that it successfully incorporates these technologies the microsoft expert shared different examples of how school entities and universities in the united states had managed to reduce the workload through the use of ai the new york city school system which has million students developed a tutor bot to assist them in the case of the university ad from michigan academics and researchers are supported by bots that help them carry out their research work more quickly and efficiently meanwhile seneca university in canada has developed a service to find work based on ai providing students with the possibility of training and carrying out simulations of job interviews for certain companies it is important to develop skills and above all for university students and academics to learn about ai said bruce thompson alliance progress the first step of conectia was taken at the end of last year when the catholic university signed an agreement with microsoft one of the main technology multinationals in the world the purpose of the collaboration agreement signed is to build and lead a cutting edge horizon in terms of digital transformation through the integration of artificial intelligence with the purpose of generating impact both in the university s own work as well as in chile and the region as explained by maría francisca yáñez director of the microsoft national technology office the alliance is not only focused on technology and ai but also on academic challenges research and educational experiences based precisely on the uc s own challenges initiatives were defined to work on over the next five years one of the great deficiencies that companies and institutions currently have in adopting technologies such as those related to ai is the fact that they lack trained teams therefore the role of the university in moving the frontier of knowledge and training students and work teams is key said maría francisca yáñez conectia considers common objectives between the uc and microsoft around understanding that digital transformation and the implementation of technologies such as ai must occur in stages in which artificial intelligence constitutes a key axis and where the university mission and vision one of the great deficiencies that companies and institutions currently have in adopting technologies such as those related to ai is the fact that they lack trained teams therefore the role of the university in moving the frontier of knowledge and training students and work teams is key maría francisca yáñez director of the microsoft national technology office mauricio bernabó director of uc digital transformation announced some of the initiatives that are being promoted in this phase of the alliance this is how a chatbot is being developed within the uc a program that uses artificial intelligence to understand questions and answer them similar to a human conversation we are working to take advantage of all the information that the university has rsity to be able to ask the chatbot questions and have very quick answers we hope to include all the regulations data related to academic units careers and other types of information which will be very useful for all people who will be able to access it from various devices explained bernabó we are doing various tests of how through all the university s data which is on the internet various analyzes can be done very quickly by degree and faculties mauricio bernabó director of digital transformation uc copilot a artificial intelligence developed by microsoft is another of the tools that are already being used at the university and when connected to the internet it allows you to always have updated information among its various functions it is used to search for data summarize conversations and request the creation of messages content image design similar to other platforms such as chatgpt a third initiative consists of taking advantage of all the information available to the university through ai with reporting systems we are doing various tests of how through all the university s data which is on the internet various analyzes by major and faculties can be done very quickly said the director of digital transformation and added that all members of the university community is invited to be active protagonists of this alliance under the approach that people are at the center of institutions and change processes it was determined that it is important to provide them with access to the multiple tools that exist to learn about artificial intelligence this is precisely why the academiaia platform was developed to which members of the university community can access courses generated by microsoft for free currently there are resources available among which there are courses for beginners people with intermediate and also advanced knowledge on basic concepts of ai content related to the adoption of responsible ai practices and principles training of learning models deep in software among others according to francisco quiroga deputy director of institutional technologies at the uc among the proposed goals is guaranteeing access to formal learning resources on artificial intelligence creating events and collaborative spaces that promote the exchange of ideas and experiences about ai and providing tools that facilitate the adoption of ai based technologies in daily activities academiaia is aimed at the academic body students and the university s professional and administrative team various events will also be organized associated with this platform the closest will be the talk on how to create with had with generative ai that will be given on may at p m by sylvie duchamp director of external communications at microsoft for south america on the other hand a course and certification on the fundamentals of azure ai another platform that the microsoft company has was also recently launched these are eight projects already enabled in their first phase to cover four key areas environment mobility security and enabling resources to carry out technological transformations within the san joaquín campus the idea is that they will then be replicated by different municipalities to move towards a smart santiago and improve the quality of life of its inhabitants what is meant by a smart city the inter american development bank describes it as a territorial space that puts people at the center of development that incorporates technologies in urban management and that uses these elements to stimulate the formation of an efficient government which makes cities more spaces resilient and efficient under this premise between and the first smart city on a national scale has been created at the uc san joaquín campus this thanks to an initiative led by an alliance between lab claro uc g innovation center and sé santiago a strategic program of corfo metropolitano and fundación país digital the project seeks to implement technological solutions enabled with g with the aim of improving people s well being the idea is to test different technologies so that they can later be replicated by municipalities the implementation work has already begun with eight technologies deployed on campus in areas such as environment mobility security and enabling resources to generate technological changes among others since work began on the smart city at scale it was known that it was a challenging project but despite its complexity as francisco pizarro deputy director of the r d area with industry at the uc anacleto angelini innovation center explains we had three fundamental items to put it into practice a demonstration space in which regional governments could see how to use these technologies a space to prototype and generate solutions from academia and a meeting place to work with entrepreneurs on open innovation models that is why not only the san joaquín campus its professionals and the portfolio of entrepreneurs were made available but also the ability to coordinate the challenge of delivering impact solutions that improve the quality of life of the inhabitants something that is the objective of smart cities says the professional this project also contemplates the deployment of infrastructure that combines technologies such as fiber optics g stand alone or independent g and iot internet of things all of them key elements to migrate from traditional management to the smart city finally it also has the support of the companies nokia and qualcomm a border initiative according to the rector ignacio sánchez the initiative responds to the current and future challenges that the d development of urban centers and the efficient use of technology developing proofs of concept that are scalable at the business and territorial level since they are enabling technologies that offer better coordination lower costs and above all better management of the territory this opportunity reinforces the importance of collaboration between academia industry and the public sector for the benefit of civil society which we have been strongly promoting at uc said the rector when the initiative was announced in august in the alliance will enter a second stage in which new areas such as energy lighting waste management entertainment education water management and economy will be integrated below are the eight technological solutions that have already come into operation on the san joaquín campus security technologies wcs it is a video analytics technology to support physical security in streets interiors such as companies municipalities factories among others with intelligence and data that allows security prevention at the san joaquín campus it will be integrated in real time into the campus s closed circuit cameras and thus immediate alerts can be obtained in the event of any unusual event smert solution that consists of collecting critical emergency response information and displaying it in a qr code at the entrance of buildings so that emergency teams can act quickly in this way on campus it will allow the management of firefighters quickly being able to quickly view the map of the facilities to effectively address the contingency enabling security resources juganu omniflow it is a lighting model created in portugal which is self sustainable through the use of wind and photovoltaic energy these are intelligent luminaires capable of performing video analytics in real time and providing network coverage to passers by specifically it is a lighting spotlight with artificial intelligence and environmental sensors which allows it to capture movements optimize traffic identify distress signals suspicious activity and population density environment iotree integration of complex high resolution environmental indicators on the health of urban ecosystems for monitoring through multispectral images specifically the solution will allow complex environmental indicators to be obtained about the health of the campus trees such as the quality of photosynthesis or diseases beewaze the initiative monitors environmental conditions inside and outside hives such as temperature humidity and weight generating forecasts and historical information about the location in this way the beekeeper will be able to take the necessary actions to help reduce the death of his bees thus increasing the productivity of the apiary smartfarming it is a solution for agriculture that consists of a soil monitoring station with plantations for control based on different data such as temperature humidity acidity and wind among others environment and mobility urbetrack project born in in argentina with a focus on traceability and logistics it is a digital platform that helps municipalities manage and coordinate work plans in public spaces thus seeking to increase resource efficiency it seeks to manage and make waste collection more efficient in addition to allowing the management of vehicle fleets knowing their geolocation and traceability in real time mobility geodata it is a system that allows projecting flows of people and cars based on the collection of anonymous data from people who connect to the cellular antenna network it is a tool that will carry out a continuous analysis of all the visits that occur daily on the san joaquín campus based on this information campus authorities will be able to make decisions regarding infrastructure and resource allocation among other issues likewise it allows citizens to plan routes and thus achieve greater efficiency in their transportation this november former undergraduate and graduate students will begin to exclusively use microsoft tools in mid november those who have completed both undergraduate and graduate studies at the catholic university will begin to use the email and email tools microsoft storage thus carrying out the migration process from the google platform the uc email and storage change project is an institutional initiative that seeks to unify the digital ecosystem through the microsoft platform in order to facilitate access to information promote collaboration between units and improve the user experience user it is a process that is carried out in three stages the first consisted of enabling alumni accounts in microsoft a phase that began in july and culminates on november with the deactivation of the google workspace platform for undergraduate and graduate alumni the second stage corresponds to the migration from microsoft exchange to microsoft of officials and academics the third phase will involve a self migration process of all google workspace accounts to microsoft between the end of the second semester of and the beginning of the first semester of an instance that will include academics students officials and other members of the uc community for mauricio bernabó director of uc digital transformation this implementation is relevant as it seeks to enhance collaboration coordination and the exchange of knowledge between units through a single platform that avoids incompatibilities and allows horizontal communication between the different members of the uc community bernabó highlights the need to advance digital transformation initiatives to effectively face current challenges and thus maintain the standards that allow us to be recognized as one of the best universities in latin america this project seeks to enhance collaboration coordination and exchange of knowledge between units through a single platform that avoids incompatibilities and allows horizontal communication between members of the uc community mauricio bernabó director of uc digital transformation as soon as possible the digital transformation department together with the it department has set up a help desk website suggestions tutorials and support material so that undergraduate and graduate alumni can rescue their information storing it on a device of your choice or by performing an automigration to microsoft for now efforts are focused on supporting the alumni community in this transition process and then providing detailed information on the beginning of the self migration phase of students academics and uc officials towards the new system at which time support will be offered and m helpful material for all members of the uc community the graduate school promotes saga a management system that will improve the experience and facilitate the supervision and support of doctoral students saga doctoral thesis management and support system is the name given to a modern online platform that will serve students academics authorities and administrative and professional teams that make up the uc doctoral community this is an innovative project that has been promoted by the graduate school of the vice rector s office for research and that responds to the need to have a system for the management and support of the doctoral thesis development process both academics and professionals with experience in the uc doctoral training model have participated in its design framed within the uc s digital transformation strategy saga began this project in january with the participation of the faculty of biological sciences and the digital transformation directorate this is a key moment for the project since the white march for the adoption of the platform began the platform is characterized by being a modern friendly standardized tool created tailored to the doctoral ecosystem that will contribute to improving the interaction between students and their thesis directors as well as between doctoral program authorities and management teams who support these duos the vice rector for research pedro bouchon explains that this project has had a seal that is the interaction and collaboration of the different doctoral programs which were fundamental to be able to access the challenges and particular characteristics which seek to be addressed by this platform this project has had a seal that is the interaction and collaboration of the different doctoral programs pedro bouchon vice rector of uc research the use of saga will facilitate the process of monitoring the doctoral research cycle providing timely and quality information for the decision making to program heads management teams local and central authorities of the university available from anywhere in the world it is the first platform interconnected with the different central systems of the uc through the institutional data warehouse storage system the saga platform has modules that are already operational and that allow you to manage and coordinate the activities related to each stage of the doctoral research cycle candidacy and annual follow up activities in august of this year the thesis defense module will also be enabled in addition the system promotes the use of the thesis direction support program tools which will be available throughout the research cycle to support the strengthening of the relationship between students and thesis directors diego cosmelli director of the graduate school ados highlights that saga facilitates the management and monitoring of students in the uc research cycle optimizing the times and workloads that are so valuable in this training cycle at the same time it will allow us to have key data and information for the accreditation processes of doctoral programs which has a positive impact on the image and prestige of the uc even internationally saga will allow us to have key data and information for the accreditation processes of doctoral programs which positively impacts the image and prestige of the uc diego cosmelli director of the uc graduate school the digital transformation directorate participated in the development of the platform a unit that is promoting the adoption of technologies within the uc to favor institutional management one of the advances in the uc digital transformation is expressed with saga a system that technologizes highly specific processes such as the tools for the management and support of the doctoral thesis in a friendly environment you can have information today updated and in a common and transversal format to all the academic units of the uc says mauricio bernabó director of digital transformation one of the advances in the uc digital transformation is expressed with saga a system that technologizes highly specific processes mauricio bernabó director of digital transformation students academics program heads management teams and authorities can enter to learn saga in this link and take advantage of its benefits in the development of the doctoral thesis framed in the digital transformation process the integrated continuing education management system sigec consolidates the regional leadership of the university which in had more than thousand enrolled students an important milestone was achieved a few days ago by the integrated continuing education management system sigec that the catholic university is promoting the incorporation of a new digital module for the commercial and financial management of the diplomas and courses of all the faculties of the university institution those who study at uc will now be able to expeditiously access their courses emails certifications evaluations payment and enrollment processes so their training experience will benefit this is an initiative framed in the digital transformation process of the uc which is led by the pro rector s office for institutional management the directorate of continuing education in collaboration with faculties teachers and other units such as the directorate of information technology directorate of digital transformation and digital management sigec is a large ecosystem of digital platforms that are automatically integrated for the entire management of continuing education which involves the entire life process of the student from the dissemination of the programs application and enrollment academic management processes financial the delivery of courses on virtual platforms certification among others explains luz montero director of continuing education sigec is a large ecosystem of digital platforms that are automatically integrated for the entire management of continuing education which involves the entire life process of the student luz montero director of continuing education the initiative that began to be devised in under the push from the authorities of that time such as paulina gómez former vice rector of communications and margarita guarello former director of continuing education will mean that the service will be totally digital and fast which will help not only improve its quality but that also internationalizes the academic offering of the uc currently more than of the courses offered are online which is why it is increasingly relevant for systems and processes to be digital during phase of the project had been launched with the implementation of an electronic certification system with an advanced digital signature the second stage recently completed includes in addition to the business administration module also an updated website and new registration and registration portals which will be integrated with salesforce a world class software for business management through a highly integrated and digital system the platform allows us to enhance key and strategic aspects of continuing education such as perfecting and increasing the academic offering enhancing the growth variety and competitiveness of the programs ta it is also possible to improve the positioning of the offer consolidate the organization and internal capabilities in this area and have the infrastructure technologies and investments to strengthen it and project it in the long term patricio donoso pro rector of institutional management points out that the implementation of sigec seeks to achieve a more dynamic clear and timely experience for students who are the main focus of this digital transformation he adds that for this we must accelerate a cultural change to which we are all called to get involved and adapt thus strengthening our own work capabilities we must accelerate a cultural change to which we are all called to get involved and adapt thus strengthening our own work capabilities patricio donoso pro rector of institutional management these changes are framed in the context of a great growth that continuing education has experienced in the uc during more than students enrolled many of whom also come from various regions of chile and other places in the world the increase is relevant if you consider that in there were just over thousand students the transformation is still underway since the implementation of phase of sigec both the teams that have directly participated in the operation of these new systems and the academic units of the university have strengthened their collaboration to comply with the new management standards we are very happy to have achieved this achievement after years of hard work we know that we must continue working intensely in this period of stabilization of the systems with a view to the next implementation of the academic module says the director of continuing education luz montero she emphasizes that the transformation of continuing education does not end with this project we need convening aligned work with a vision for the future by all these elements being integrated they support each other it will allow us to respond more efficiently to the needs of the students paulina rodríguez director of the sigec project what are the next steps the director of the project paulina rodríguez explains that during the will be the turn of the implementation of the academic module which will incorporate banner an academic records software and the moodle platform as a learning management system into the ecosystem as all these elements are integrated they support each other will allow us to respond with greater efficiency to the needs of the students a committee of experts from the public private and academic world will develop the cybersecurity roadmap a concrete plan led by the uc innovation center and microsoft to strengthen chile s digital security within three years cybercrime is a problem that affects various sectors of society this is evidenced in the study impact of covid on the culture and operation of chilean smes by microsoft chile which showed that out of companies declared that the pandemic accelerated the digital transformation of their business through technological adoption indicating that of them invested to facilitate teleworking however according to forbes magazine small businesses were three times more susceptible than larger companies to cybercriminal attacks such as hacking cyber threats and phishing among others cybersecurity is a transversal and progressive need due to the exponential increase in crimes linked to cybercrime and the high rate of attempted cyberattacks on public private entities and above all civil society according to data provided by microsoft s cyber signals study in december alone million cyber attacks were recorded globally while more than billion threats were reported by business and consumer devices blocking more than billion malicious email accounts aimed at clients and consumers digital security is also an urgent need in the country hence the cybersecurity roadmap was born an initiative led by the uc anacleto angelini innovation center and microsoft chile and which was born from a previous plan the digital transformation roadmap for economic reactivation the objective is to develop a concrete action plan to be executed in the next three years the initiative which brings together experts from the public private and academic world from various areas and industries seeks to contribute to the diagnosis and impact the development of proposals that allow chile to address the immense cybersecurity gaps we face exposed for pedro bouchon vice rector of uc research and president of the board of directors of the uc innovation center this roadmap arises in the context of the need to accelerate digital transformation in the country to help economic reactivation this transformation however cannot be carried out in an unprotected manner given that digitalization opens important spaces of vulnerability on which critical prevention mitigation and cyber resilience capabilities must be built in the ecosystem he says and he adds the speed of cybersecurity attacks and the constant evolution and sophistication of cybercrime makes it necessary to develop university industry state collaboration models that are capable of pushing frontier research and facilitate technological and knowledge transfer in an agile way this is where the roadmap plays a fundamental role in facilitating the development of spaces for experimentation and associative proofs of concept which allow for cybersecurity laboratories for the development of advanced research and the training of skills and talent new competencies to confront cyberattacks a critical axis for the development of a roadmap is the development of talent and competencies says mario ponce dean of the faculty of mathematics member of the advisory committee and the talent development committee of the cybersecurity roadmap along these lines significant gaps are projected in the specialized talent necessary to face the cybersecurity challenges of the coming years which means a challenge not only in organizations that demand this type of profiles and that must generate new models for attracting and retaining employees talent but also as dean ponce says for us as a university regarding how we generate new training models that adapt to these demands for talent according to the dean our challenges are around what new profiles competencies methodologies and modalities we need to create and offer considering these challenges in a transversal manner both for undergraduate and graduate students as continuing education for professionals and even work at the school level and he adds that we have addressed some of these lines through the creation of new degrees and new continuing education programs and at the school level through the mathematics olympiads which are projected as a space for detecting important talent however there are still opportunities to develop training models together with the industry and with greater agility to respond to the demands of the ecosystem work methodology in these almost three months of work together with the advisory committee we already developed the first stage that corresponded to a shared diagnosis of gaps and opportunities in cybersecurity in this process it was very relevant to understand what comparative experiences exist and what initiatives are being executed in the local and regional ecosystem explains rocío ortiz r d coordinator in the area of digital transformation and cybersecurity of the uc innovation center on this shared diagnosis a prioritization was carried out and three strategic areas were selected that gave rise to the development committees explains the person responsible for the work methodology of the roadmap for cybersecurity the advisory committee is led by maría francisca yáñez director of innovation and technology at microsoft chile and ramón molina executive director of the uc innovation center as chair or director and co chair or co director respectively amente in addition to an outstanding group of leaders and experts from various areas who will be in charge of preparing work proposals from the different development committees technological talent and cybersecurity culture the work will culminate with the publication of a document in the public domain that will seek to generate a contribution and social impact the challenges of the cybersecurity roadmap the next challenges will be to build the portfolios of projects that need to be executed over the next three years in order to achieve the future vision that we expect around cybersecurity for chile defining a tactical and associative line of work to execute it says rocío ortiz as ramón molina says one of the first conclusions reached in this first stage after the survey is that there is already a strategic diagnosis associated with what the cybersecurity gaps and opportunities are for chile as well as indicators of our national level of maturity on this issue therefore the role of this roadmap is to carry out a tactical and concrete lowering of the action plan that our country needs to reach the desired level of maturity in this line innovation is the fundamental basis to be able to develop collaborative and optimal work models to move with the level of agility that we need adds molina the three development committees that have already started their work after the strategic prioritization implemented are talent and development of skills in cybersecurity culture in cybersecurity and technology ecosystems protocols and standards for cybersecurity these tables bring together more than experts technicians and specialists from various areas and industries who will be working over the next two months once the portfolio of projects proposed by these committees has been consolidated the advisory council will review and evaluate them to define which measures will be finally considered

first is focused on supporting faculty members our center is at their service assistance from the center for teaching innovation involves supporting professors in their reflection on how to continuously improve their teaching the center s educational engineers with their diverse experience and scientific oversight are able to understand and suggest solutions to teaching problems that professors may encounter the second is focused on training faculty members through the in house psl school we offer a great number of training programs to raise their understanding of the changes currently taking place in education this is given particular focus during the welcome week for new professors a perfect time to promote the center or during pédagodays two days of peer to peer exchanges to reflect on one s own teaching practices the main challenge ahead of us is raising the profile of the center and its services we need to reach out to all psl schools the aim is to understand the specific characteristics of their teaching to compile their needs in relation to the center s services and of course to meet them this will be achieved by building a community of practice for psl faculty members far from replacing the role of the teacher technology is a supplementary tool that can compensate for potential shortcomings especially in times of crisis mattias mano the health crisis we have gone through has put students most of all in a situation of great difficulty too many of them have become very isolated professors have also shown an unprecedented degree of resilience in ensuring the infamous instructional continuity this continuity was made possible largely thanks to digital tools with videoconferencing in the main however for many professors this forced experimentation with remote learning was very negative i would like to highlight the strength and courage of the administrative staff especially in the information systems department and in our center who made it possible to maintain teaching during an emergency situation as the crisis nears its end which we all hope will be for good services like the center for teaching innovation cannot ignore the fact that many professors may harbor a desire to do things as befor e the pandemic overall the pandemic has advanced us by several years in terms of our understanding of digital tools its impact is a powerful reminder that far from replacing the role of the teacher technology is a supplementary tool that can compensate for potential shortcomings especially in times of crisis the center for teaching innovation aims to synthesize this wealth of experience our goal is to perpetuate the best practices that have emerged from the crisis and to extend their use innovation pédagogique l enseignement en situation d urgence en france july by perrine de coëtlogon mattias mano bertrand mocquet mattias mano digital technology is just a tool we will never push the use of a tool for the sake of it when a teacher asks us to implement a particular moodle activity or a particular wooclap activity we seek first and foremost to meet an educational need for example using wooclap facilitates the interaction between students and the professor in an auditorium this tool makes it possible to pause a lecture and ask the students questions to ensure that they can follow what they are being taught similarly almost all classes rely on the use of educational resources the moodle learning platform is used to centralize and classify these resources professors have the option to upload all of them when they build their course and to make them available to students as they go along this reduces the administrative load of a course and facilitates the learning process in short once educational needs have been identified the center helps the teacher find the best way to meet them very often the digital tools at our disposal make it easier to offer a solution mattias mano the simplest way to find out more about our activities and to get in touch is to visit our website there you will find interviews with professors useful information a calendar of the training courses we offer at the psl school and most importantly how to contact us for a support request the pédagodays psl which will be held on june and registration via the psl school are also a great way to find out more about us on these days we will be offering workshops and discussions with teachers who have worked with us in the past we also have three branches in three different locations on campus dauphine

psl and the web school factory will launch a new month diploma course in intrapreneurship and digital transformation this diploma offering is a new initiative for cfee campus formation etudiants entreprises with an emphasis on autonomy and expertise the goal is to bring students employees and professionals together in collaborative project teams and to train them interview with the managers of the training program anne lalou director of web school factory and bruno rostand director of innovation and entrepreneurship at université psl bruno rostand it is indeed a partnership of a new type but at psl we are used to creating bridges between disciplines and players we were contacted by the web school factory to develop a joint response to the pia disrupt campus call for proposals and saw this as an opportunity to further diversify our approaches and discover new perspectives particularly in the areas of innovation and digital transformation which are priorities for us anne lalou by co creating this curriculum we wanted and this is very new to get involved in setting up companies and open them to new innovative ecosystems to meet this challenge the campus of formation etudiants entreprises is based on three pillars while taking into account the new skills needed in today s digital world we wanted to not only implement collaborations between students and employees but also create a new project based training program cfee will develop the creativity entrepreneurship and innovation capabilities of our students anne lalou in companies innovation is being done more and more by intrapreneurial approaches in practice this means that an sme or a large group gives some of its employees the time and support necessary for the development of a project that could potentially turn into a profitable business intrapreneurship offers companies the opportunity to think outside the box and open up to the vitality of the entrepreneurial ecosystem digital transformation and innovation will increasingly go through this type of approach and we wanted to support the framework of cfee by providing students and employees with the necessary tools bruno rostand similar to our entrepreneurship trainings iti psl pépite cfee will develop the creativity entrepreneurship and innovation capacities of our students but intrapreneurship starts with a concrete challenge to answer the needs of a partner company and this brings a new dimension an immersion in the life of the company and an experience of the digital transition which happens there in this regard cfee completes and enriches our training offer and moreover some of the activities of cfee will take place at the psl lab coworking space of the psl pépite entrepreneurship group anne lalou there will be many of them the impact of the cfee student training will be in my opinion quite immediate the web school factory already exists student projects give a fresh look at the teams of partner companies it is a fruitful interaction that moves lines and opens additional interesting perspectives the students of the cfee will be able to profit from it this new curriculum is also in our opinion an investment of the future it will complement the training of shs students or psl engineering students by providing them with expertise and experience in digital transformation besides the mixing of social origins internationalization or parity intergenerational is essential cfee will be an example bruno rostand students have a lot to learn from employees about the reality of a market and business experiences in return they bring a fresh look to which the rigor and the level of requirement of their training match employees will leave their comfort zone put aside their certainties to bring out innovative and transformative concepts for their company anne lalou we bet that this intergenerational collaboration will be stimulating constructive and above all that it will serve as a founding experience for their lifelong training to learn in initial training in continuing education online or even in groups these formats will disappear and it is a great opportunity for the players to experience it at this stage we talk a lot about diversity in today s world besides the mixing of social origins internationalization or parity intergenerational diversity is essential cfee will be an example start ups i hope will emerge from this program and after all rather than finding a job why not create it anne lalou more than recruitments i want the cfee curriculum to lead learners to a concrete ambition offering them a taste for innovation and creativity start ups i hope will emerge from this program and after all rather than finding a job why not create it the key is to develop the capacity for transformation and innovation inside and outside organizations cfee will be the proof that our companies today are ready to innovate differently organizations must accept confrontation and understand that student collaboration can result in great new concepts that s what i want for our students anne lalou dear learners a unique opportunity awaits you to start a new chapter of your training seize this opportunity see yourself as pioneers forging your individual paths and future create innovation today and tomorrow do not limit yourself be ambitious be resolutely intrapreneurial because the transformation of our economic landscape also happens with you bruno rostand dear students be a part of the digital revolution alongside our partner companies rise to the challenge and collaborate with a diverse multicultural and intergenerational team dear employees of our business partners come share your experiences and ambitions with our students in order to co create the solutions of tomorrow the digital transformation is ushering in a host of new business practices in september to help today s managers decision makers entrepreneurs and employees draw on those latest practices to enhance their capacity for innovation creativity and autonomy psl and the web school factory introduced the new cfee program campus formation etudiants entreprises a month interdisciplinary course in intrapreneurship we talked to the program s instructional and project directors about this unusual new course offering françois pumir half of this year s cfee class are students from psl and the web school factory while the other half are professionals from our partner businesses the primary benefit of this training is that it gives the participants a new perspective and a set of methodologies for managing the digital transformation which is exactly what those participants have been hoping to find one of the essential ways we re effecting the digital transformation is by putting people at the heart of every project we encourage our students to adopt a user centric approach and to tackle every issue in terms of what s desirable rather than the more restrictive mindset still so common in the business world of what s feasible at this stage everyone s still very motivated although the change in viewpoint has been a little disconcerting for some in the group thibaut barbarin the students and professionals in our class come from a wide array of backgrounds they re engineers attorneys managers and so on and within their work groups they may each take a similar approach or they may clash that s proven very fertile we can already see that the learning process will be much faster than in other programs launch of a course dedicated to intrapreneurship and digital transformation f p right at the start of the semester we held the cfee hack to serve as a real world exercise the class had six days to come up with new business models for some very established industries it s a difficult test regardless of your age or experience because you can t simply fall back on an automatic response the goal of the exercise is to give students the ability to sit down in front a corporate board or a group of lenders and offer a vision of a given topic that s not just business minded but user centric concrete and objective the instructional team professors our partner business leaders etc helped guide them through that first experience it s a shift in perspective that can be disconcerting but it s necessary in order to embrace the radically new vision of what the digital transformation can be t b the cfee hack was a really enlightening experience for everyone in the class about the need to learn more ever since they ve been much more aware of the learning curve they re investing the time and they re using that learning time more effectively that was also a very good learning experience for handling data the digital transforma tion involves massive amounts of data and in my view it s pretty critical for every professional to get up to speed on those issues f p project based instruction has been around since well before the cfee but we re changing the format and especially the objective because our instructional approach involves lecturers entrepreneurs professors experts students businesses and their employees all at once the digital transformation projects we re tackling aren t just fictional case studies that illustrate some pedagogical point they re actual company projects whose progress and results are discussed by each company s executive committee so there are serious issues at stake the goal and the ambition we ve set is to create spin offs or business units and employees are at the heart of that process of learning how to generate value t b when project based instruction is used in conventional academic curricula it often uses the pedagogical objective as the starting point and the case studies they use may be real but decades old with the cfee we ve chosen to take a different approach we start with what the company hopes to achieve and we join forces to provide the deliverables f p a very close relationship as we said before the cfee program is distinctive in that its work groups include students practitioners educators there s no disinterested support everyone has a stake in the project s success that approach applies to the relationship with each company as well companies get an update on their project s progress every two weeks and it s not uncommon for the cfee teams to meet with the company s executives and high level managers over lunch to work on their projects f p for me it s someone who has a real desire to be an entrepreneur and the necessary determination to eliminate obstacles and find solutions t b someone who s looking for something different whether they d like a more meaningful experience like so many people these days or they re simply interested in creating a start up it s that sense of change that s really important my feeling is that management is becoming more horizontal these days and an entrepreneurial mindset will be a key asset f p again it s not a typical learning experience and above all we re looking for people who can all be part of a single team the oral interview will play a much bigger role in whether you re accepted than your cv or cover letter f p they ll be people who can strike the right balance within their organizations whether they re entrepreneurs intrapreneurs or something else the important thing is that they know how to make a commitment and prosper fulfilling individual career goals is not what the cfee program is about t b they ll be able to take responsibility for the decisions they make and influence the people around them to help bring about change this training really promises an exciting personal adventure fruit de la collaboration ent re the psl university the innovation factory and the web school factory the new cfee course business student

with the right processes and tools in place your team can implement more structured workflows automate wherever possible integrate data into existing campaigns and build an agile enterprise these elements work together to create cohesive operations that drive new sales when there are three essential forces that drive the strategy adopting a digital first mindset creating a digitally literate culture using data to ensure continuous evolvement first things first your digital transformation journey will require every member of the organization to adopt a digital first mindset while the world has been progressively becoming more digitally savvy the in person barriers due to covid have accelerated the need for efficient technology from scheduling doctor visits to ordering takeout delivery digital tools have weaved their way into every area of our lives therefore businesses need to be ready and willing to adopt these new technologies to meet consumer demand but a digital first mindset alone isn t enough to power a successful digital transformation you also need to become digitally literate your business must be adopting new technology and ensuring that they are being used as efficiently as possible therefore the second driving factor of implementing a digital transformation strategy is enforcing effective onboarding and training sessions to create a digitally literate team finally the third driving force of digital transformation is continuous evolvement through consistent research and data collectio n businesses can use valuable insights to identify and drive enhancements these enhancements may be internal such as refining repetitive tasks that put additional stress on team members or external like improving website flow to create a better customer

to move quickly in that direction but the path of digital transformation is rarely if ever a straight line the pace of change requires organizations to pivot regularly you need to be both fast and nimble that kind of agility often requires rethinking organizational structures traditional hierarchical structures like multi layer decision making and lengthy approval processes can get in the way of the ability to take advantage of opportunities rapidly building for the future requires targeted demolition of out dated structures essential checks must of course remain but successful digital transformation requires clearing obstacles to quick experimentation and implementation traditionally when organizations wanted to innovate or update their offerings they would go out and hire someone with the right kind of expertise to drive that change but when it comes to today s digital transformation experts don t exist change is happening so fast that even the most qualified and experienced employees must constantly update their knowledge that is why it is so important to build a culture of curiosity and voracious learning if an organization is aiming for digital transformation in order to drive new knowledge creation you need to have people not just willing to but passionate about going and learning new things and thinking in new ways dr hinds explains in the webinar the best most ground breaking ideas are often born out of unusual combinations of expertise or technology traditional org charts can silo in knowledge making that kind of fruitful cross pollination less likely a culture of unbounded collaboration on the other hand allows or even incentivizes employees to work across traditional boundaries for instance in cross functional groups sometimes it even means working outside of the organization when you need to access expertise that doesn t exist within the organization itself historically this kind of interdisciplinary work was handled asynchronously one team would work on their portion of a project before handing it off to another team that iterative process is just not fast enough anymore for digital transformation to succeed a culture of unbounded collaboration is essential trying lots of new and out of the box ideas is essential to learn what works and what doesn t in the uncertain and fast moving process of digital transformation but employees are unwilling to try new things if they believe they will be laughed at or even punished if their ideas fail organizations must explicitly incentivize risk taking and even failure by this hinds doesn t mean when we know how to do something right and just get sloppy that s a preventable failure that should be discouraged but organizations should encourage the other kind of failure discussed by edmonsdon intelligent failures at the frontier these are failures that provide new knowledge they re learning opportunities for digital transformation to succeed an organization s culture must embrace this second sort of failure the bottom line for dr hinds and for those both leading and participating in digital transformation is that success is as much about the right culture as it is about the right technology digital transformation requires rethinking organizations cultures structures and systems and the way that people think about their work and work together she believes these changes aren t just for industries that we usually think of as hi tech nor are they just the preserve of top executives even industries that are typically thought about as being low tech will be and are experiencing radical changes dr hinds says recalling a recent trip to a dairy farm where the cows were milked automatically and output was monitored remotely via ipad it s important to be ready

transformation within an organization and they ll likely talk about hiring exceptional tech talent understanding the latest breakthroughs in fields like ai machine learning and robotics and providing the space and support to design systems and solutions that work ooops looks like you have javascript turned off this means you can t see the form on this page you can use to if you asked dr pamela hinds the fortinet founders chair and professor of management science engineering at stanford and co director of the center on work technology and organization she would say that s a good start understanding the technologies that underpin digital transformation is necessary but not sufficient radically remaking an organization s products services and business models requires not just understanding technology but also cultural change as dr hinds explains in the webinar most traditional organizations simply cannot cope with the pace of innovation happening now they were built for reliability not for speed a growing body of evidence shows organizations that manage to transform themselves also undergo significant cultural change from root to tip what does that cultural change look like in the webinar dr hinds outlines five essential shifts organizations must make to succeed at digital transformation the first and most essential shift is towards a more customer centric culture digital transformation doesn t happen for its own sake it happens to serve customers better and drive the business forward if you don t understand your customers unmet needs the other aspects of your digital transformation won t be focused on the right goals you can have cutting edge technology and processes but they won t move your business forward if they don t ultimately help you delight your customers once you understand where you re trying to get to with your digital transformation it s key to move quickly in that direction but the path of digital transformation is rarely if ever a straight line the pace of change requires organizations to pivot regularly you need to be both fast and nimble that kind of agility often requires rethinking organizational structures

projects the to celebrate its th anniversary chula president announces the success of the speedboat strategy in managing the university in a volatile situation to drive social innovations focusing on being a research university that teaches revising its curriculum and building graduates competencies in line with the world of the future during the past few and rather difficult years most of us have faced with the covid pandemic chulalongkorn university has launched several innovations and studies to serve the society such as cu robocovid a medical support robot the covid screening kit covid scan covid sniffing dogs and devices nasal spray automated vaccine filling machine survival kits the chulacov mrna covid vaccine and chula baiya protein subunit vaccine from tobacco leaves etc these innovations are the result of the speedboat strategy and chula s vision for the future under the leadership of professor dr bundhit eua arporn president of chula i have set the vision of innovations for society as the core of university management to harness knowledge and wisdom to make society a better one and to move towards being a research university that teaches chula graduates must be equipped with the skills of the st century and possess the quality of global citizens while excelling academically so that they are well recognized by employers around the world more importantly university administration must be involved in managing national and global public issues to build a better future society this is the direction in which prof dr bundhit has been steering chula toward for the past six years not only has chula ranked no in thailand for the rd consecutive year and top in the world in the impact rankings but most importantly chula has been maintaining its role as the university that serves and brings continuous change to society in line with the motto when society is troubled chula has the solutions on the occasion of the th anniversary of the founding of chulalongkorn university prof dr bundhit discusses the concepts behind the speedboat strategy the direction and approach of university management and the university vision aimed to be realized in the future the covid pandemic has altered societies the world and the way people live at all levels and aspects of their lives including work school economic and social life although the pandemic has begun to subside technological and social disruption will continue to affect people s lives and social patterns the future remains obscure change is certain this is a challenging world that higher education institutions must embrace keep abreast with and set trends for the era universities need to simplify and focus on goals prof dr bundhit said of the future direction of higher education institutions to manage a university amidst challenges every organization should set clear goals when everyone in the organization ha s a clear goal they will devote their full strength to the need to do and and not waste too much time doing unnecessary things nice to do since the day of his first appointment as president prof dr bundhit has adopted the speedboat strategy and tailored it in such a way as to make organization management leaner and swifter why speedboat strategy chula is a university under government supervision it is a large organization with an old structure and rigid system like a big clunky ship with an outdated motor whether operating turning moving forward or halting it takes a long time it is not agile nor can it keep up with the changes in the present and future world changes happen rapidly and there are always new opportunities in store if you keep hanging onto the big ship and heading in one direction you will not be able to keep up with the game reforming long standing systems and institutional structures is not an easy task since people in the system are used to the old patterns and systems a good solution is not to knock down old ones but to create new ones to do new things we have to break up into smaller boats to do new things which requires new people in addition we also need to set up a new working team of agile members with a positive attitude who can seek new opportunities in different directions and environments to deliver quality work that benefits society explains prof dr bundhit over the past few years many of chula s speedboats have pioneered new waters and proven the success of this strategy that has disrupted the society innovation hub ihub for instance which has incubated over start ups with portfolios of commercial innovations that have generated almost billion baht market valuation the bascii program that has signed an mou with the sutardja center for entrepreneurship and technology scet of the university of california berkeley granting chula students the opportunity to learn innovative startup how tos in silicon valley boot camp silicon valley innovation leadership program cu enterprise cue that supports chula s startups by raising funds from the government and private sectors to create and develop innovations that benefit the country degree plus program an open education platform that promotes online with human touch education dissemination to the general public the main product of the university is its people chula focuses on creating future leaders or leaders who go out to serve society the modern world needs leaders who have the skills and competencies to learn and apply knowledge to make them work in the real world aside from academic knowledge chula students need to be cultivated for competency to solve complex problems and have good characteristics to manage and live in a fast changing tough creative and out of the box world therefore chula s direction and the people building process have changed from the kind of teaching in which stud ents sit and listen to lectures in class to students and professors learning together through research and knowledge application to solve real world social problems in today s world knowledge is accessible without teachers and knowledge is constantly changing we can see that much of the knowledge has become obsolete such as some financial knowledge these days there are blockchains mobile payments qr code payments and so on yet skills and competency in applying knowledge for useful purposes will always be with the learners if graduates of chula have the skills and competencies they will be able to learn on their own exchange knowledge with others create new knowledge and keep on using it to benefit society the future direction of higher education institutions cannot focus on teaching knowledge in general but rather to build specific knowledge that is appropriate to the social context and the problems of the society which are always changing up until recently chula has been a teaching university that produces research with the main focus on teaching and research as secondary but with the direction of creating people to build the future chula has transformed itself into a research university that teaches which means that the professors must build upon the available knowledge in research or connect with the outside world and then pass on the practical experience and knowledge to students to gain specific knowledge prof dr bundhit elaborates on specific knowledge that is beneficial to the society that it derives from research participation in the actual application of knowledge in solving problems and students going outside the university context to work in the real world active learning problem based learning and inviting outside professors for discussion over the past few years under the pandemic and the speedboat strategy chula has overhauled its curriculum to meet more of the global needs such as the bascii curriculum which integrates arts social sciences and science the gened curriculum has also been updated to provide students with a general education that s more attuned to the social contexts etc in addition learning processes have been migrated from legacy systems using purchased learning management system lms such as blackboard to chula s own lms mycourseville also support systems for teaching and learning as well as academic work have been developed i e digital transformation through cunex app and a lifelong learning support system through chula mooc cu neuron etc chula focuses on the policy to underline and support innovative research that creates a positive impact on society and reduces external dependence during the covid crisis many of chula s innovations have served the public including vaccine research a nasal spray patient care robots automated vaccine filling machines survival kits etc to achieve success and make a positive impact every study requ ires funding and support from various sources chula has therefore established cu enterprise cue as a funding and market mechanism for research and innovations chulalongkorn university technology center utc and siam innovation district sid have also been created to aid researchers in applying their innovations to solve real problems reorient their work to the needs of consumers and benefit society while expanding their presence in the consumer market as startups producing innovative products when we broke up the big ship into speedboats many people in the big ship were dissatisfied couldn t see why we had to do it and didn t realize that if we kept tethering the speedboats to us the big ship chula new jobs wouldn t be created some workers often claimed to be restricted by the rules and regulations those were just scapegoats people who don t want to change often find excuses for not changing thinking it s okay i ll get paid anyway this is a challenge for public university management chula has a large pool of talented people who can be divided into two main categories good at form and good at creating results i give weight to the latter those who are good at creating results this group of people will find a way out when they encounter problems for this group i will give them freedom and guidance but not directions i ll give them support and opportunities to work easily and produce good results although i may not agree with them percent if no damage is done i ll give them a chance to try it s okay for them to try and fail because they will find solutions and solve problems to gain good results for the chula president the art and science of management are to use compassion and wisdom suitable for the type of people and timing when we have a big workload we use a lot of wisdom whenever we depend on a lot of wisdom our compassion may dwindle and we may even insult others but if we use compassion together with wisdom we ll develop an understanding the understanding of the existing system the responsibilities of our people the external context of the university that is connected to internal factors this will make us understand why they didn t understand what we tried to do and why they couldn t do it we ll go and help them look for the reasons if it can be solved we ll help them fix it right away with prof dr bundhit at its helm for the past six years chula has made many contributions that have had a positive impact on society the amount of research on innovations that have ties with the private sector has increased every year the cue research department has received increased funding more research and social activities are communicated in the form of academic articles to outsiders these have moved chula up the best university ranking list every year there are still a lot of things i haven t done but if we set a little higher goal even if we don t reach those high goal s there is a greater chance of success the next step for chula that i hope for is that chula can soon be even better in all dimensions including academic as well as research and innovation in which all members of the chula community have invested for the past six years this means that chula needs to alter its structure and work to keep up with a rapidly changing world prof dr bundhit concluded introducing degree plus for the development of new generation leaders to support creative business of the future advancing its collaboration to win concept siam piwat co ltd thailand s leader of retail and real estate innovation owner and operator of world class projects such as siam paragon siam center and siam discovery and a joint venture partner of iconsiam and siam premium outlets bangkok has announced a collaborative

which all members of the chula community have invested for the past six years this means that chula needs to alter its structure and work to keep up with a rapidly changing world prof dr bundhit concluded at the age of having recently graduated from the computer engineering course at the state university of campinas unicamp césar gon opened a startup focused on software development with two college friends bruno guiçardi and fernando matt who continue to run the business thus in ci t was born it was a different time with the beginning of the commercial internet as a business tool in brazil and around the world recalls gon now years old the company prospered internationalized and became a multinational with offices in the united states canada united kingdom china and japan more than people work at the company which expects to reach r billion in revenue in and was elected the main google partner worldwide from to today ci t s main offering is no longer custom made software for corporate clients two years ago we created a methodology called lean digital transformation to help brands born in the th century adapt to the business environment of our century in this interview given at prisma the name of the building that houses the company in campinas sp gon explains the company s new business proposal and tells the secrets of the trajectory of a brazilian startup that transformed into a global company what is the lean digital transformation that you offer to the market the objective of this proposal is to change processes and the culture of corporate environments of major brands born in the th century so that they have the agility required in the digital era of the st century we want to help corporations on this transformation journey adding value that can impact their business no company no matter how successful it may have been in the past can do without redesigning itself from the customer s perspective it is no surprise that the presidents of the largest companies in the world understand digital transformation as a cultural challenge and not just a technological one what is this methodology based on it is based on three elements change in the way the company designs and builds digital solutions based on the lean philosophy see explanation below transformation of its management system with the adoption of short learning cycles and redesign of the leadership model without fear of making mistakes these three components make the company s digital transformation which will become faster more innovative and customer focused obviously this applies to the technology area you can t compete in the modern world without software and information being the heart of your business but we need to go beyond technology and promote a change in culture and way of thinking why is it important for brands to make this transition competition between companies in the st century is obsessively focused on the speed with which through data analysis we understand serve and surprise the customer but large corporations are slow by nature and are not prepared for this reality they look to the side and see an amazon a google or an apple which were born in the digital environment and are much faster than them with a presence in brazil the united states canada the united kingdom china and japan the company expects to reach r billion in revenue in is it not just a matter of adapting to new technologies but of establishing a new relationship with consumers undoubtedly the way we relate to brands is radically different from years ago our desire is more volatile we have less attachment to tradition we want to know if that brand solves our problems if it understands us and treats us in a unique way the possible way out is to truly connect in this volatility in this uncertainty where did you get inspiration to create this proposal the lean method originates from the word lean in english and emerged in the production lines of the japanese automaker toyota in the s it proposed implementing a more simplified process flow aiming to reduce waste of resources materials time labor work etc and increasing added value for the customer we were inspired by this method to expand customers digital skills in practice how does this transition happen the program is long term but with short goals we want the company to learn to think in smaller business cycles of three months what can you do in this time changing the learning dynamics of companies could you give examples of a client who goes through this process our portfolio in brazil has large corporations including coca cola itaú raízen and cielo at coca cola we are helping to implement a set of principles to change the way it organizes itself connects with the public and solves consumer problems this means shortening the release cycle going from two or three years to three or four months has the company already launched products on this innovation trail yes the first was a line of family juices which hit the market along with digital tools that collect data on the product s receptivity the second was a natural soft drink a new category in the world basically we don t want to create mass products like coke zero but to understand the habits of each consumer if coca cola can be a machine for understanding experimenting and launching with a data driven culture it will become more intelligent and closer to the consumer ci t has also undergone a transformation process since its creation right the company was born in focused on software engineering at the beginning of the commercial internet as a business tool we viewed the internet as a gateway and specialized in specific technologies our focus was the national market this first chapter of our history lasted about years then the internationalization process began leo ramos chaves campinas sp is home to one of the four ci t development centers in the world what was the transition like from a startup focused on brazil to a global company in the s anyone who wanted to participate in the information technology industry game on a global level needed to have a classification seal for software manufacturers called cmmi acronym for integrated capability maturity model we were the first brazilian company to obtain it in from then on we signed contracts in the united states how did this happen we got there by offering customized software but the business environment especially in silicon valley showed that this was an outdated model the industry of the future was one of innovation it was necessary to master a set of technologies and discover how they could create disruptions for companies and consumers the business no longer meant sitting around waiting for demand it was necessary to provoke the customer with technological opportunities and propose solutions and innovations at that time around social media smartphones cloud computing and the entire arsenal of big data began to emerge these forces changed what could be done with technology from a consumer perspective certainly we now have billions of people with a device that fits in their pocket connected through social media generating billions of data there was also a drop in computational costs and the advent of artificial intelligence techniques this changed the game it was no longer possible to design software like before the possibilities were different how did you adapt to that moment we reduce bureaucracy in the way software is produced and create another value offer for the market we overcome the business model by specification and technical design and start working plugged into the client s problems the engineering team approached the business team proactively we presented customers with technological possibilities that would allow them to generate digital assets and experiences it was the second chapter of ci t which lasted until when we created the lean digital transformation proposal how does prisma the company s headquarters in campinas fit into this new phase prisma is a digital transformation co creation space opened in part of the cultural change we propose involves creating collaborative environments where people exchange ideas and release what we call collective intelligence it is necessary to physically dismantle staid corporate environments and create new spaces with fewer symbols of power and hierarchy something that is already happening in silicon valley in the coming months we will create a second ci t prisma in california will it house ci t s business unit in the united states yes we already serve motorola johnson johnson and google among other clients for google we create finance and marketing software but our relationship is as a partner notably in machine learning and cloud computing leo ramos chaves opened at the end of the company s central building has environments that encourage co creation ci t is present in which markets united states canada china japan and europe notably in england half of the revenue of more than r million in is generated in brazil and the rest abroad mainly in the united states with around of international revenue here the entire portfolio is digital transformation but abroad this offer represents of the total the rest are contracts focused on innovation in two years we should have of the portfolio in this value proposition how is the company growing in the last years we have doubled in size every three years on average and we want to reach r billion in keeping more than of the business abroad the foreign market is a competitive ruler since the united states is the first division of our industry we have to win the game there how is the r d sector structured in the digital world the traditional vision of r d is absolutely anachronistic in which you have a laboratory with phds disconnected from the customer s reality creating things of value try to find the r d area of google or amazon it s impossible each google engineer is an innovation cell that s how i like to think about ci t the word r d has never been applied to the software industry and as every industry is becoming a software industry it applies less and less so what is the role of ci t development centers these centers located in campinas belo horizonte tokyo in japan and nimbo in china concentrate intensive human capital processes for the production of clients digital platforms such as applications e commerce portals databases for big data it is analytics belo horizonte is our export hub focused on remote technologies and services destined for the united states campinas focuses on the financial retail and e commerce areas the centers in china and japan develop technologies for smartphones and e commerce we have six other business units in total there are more than employees in the united states in china in japan and around in europe how much do you invest in innovation and how big is the team dedicated to it can t answer recently google facebook and silicon valley companies announced that they would no longer require an engineering degree here at ci t our talent attraction processes have been hands on an expression in english that means come here work with us develop solutions and see if it makes sense to work together does the diploma then make no difference our hiring has little to do with a degree although most of the employees come from unicamp and usp university of são paulo but that s not the starting point in selection processes we prioritize candidates skills learning speed and ability to

not yet have a digital transformation strategy more than half of them also have no plans to strategically address the issue in the future even among the strategically well positioned enterprises around half see digitalization only as a one off project and not as an ongoing process the bigger the company the more likely it is to have a concept in place but even among those with more than employees nearly one third have no strategy most companies taking a strategic approach to digitalization are doing so with the goal of reducing costs for example by automating processes only one in four is trying to use digital technologies to develop innovations adopt new business models or gain access to further markets however one third of the companies with a strategic outlook plan to pursue such objectives in order to increase sales in the coming years consequently the mittelstand companies are mostly using established technologies that offer immediate benefits such as cloud computing and connectivity only one quarter of those surveyed regard artificial intelligence ai as important for their own operations and just percent are using it the pragmatism of many mittelstand firms is certainly justified says jens förderer professor of innovation and digitalization at the tum campus heilbronn digitalization does not offer equally large benefits regardless of when and where it is implemented but it is a mistake to treat it as a new automation wave and focus on a few adjustments with a short term impact it involves a fundamental transformation of business models and markets affecting companies of all sizes without clear objectives and good planning companies risk a loss of competitiveness the companies without strategies listed specific problems preventing them from taking action around mentioned an inadequate digital infrastructure and the unavailability of skilled personnel one third cited excessive bureaucracy and a lack of skills in their own workforce the companies already managing the digital transformation present a similar picture more than half of them cited skills shortages bureaucracy and poor infrastructure as the key impediments it is alarming to note that barriers over which companies have no control play a much bigger role than internal factors this further discourages laggards from actively tackling the digital transformation says dr christoph geier director digital transformation at the tum campus heilbronn policy makers public administration and associations need to create the conditions so that even small companies can make a successful transformation this will be essential for retaining global market leaders and hidden champions in the region the research team also asked the smes to state who is responsible for the digital transformation within the company and which partners they wanted to work with in more than of the respondent companies the top management was directly responsible for the operational implementation very few smes are cooperating with other companies just are using cloud platforms strategic sales partners and online marketplaces only about one third of the companies see it as important to draw on external expertise for example through consultancies or universities managing digitalization from the boss s desk it sounds good in principle says michaela lindenmayr a researcher at the professorship for innovation and digitalization the top management must ensure a strategic approach to the digital transformation in some cases however it is fair to ask whether senior executives can invest enough time and whether the company is making good use of the skills in the functional units the specialized knowledge and skills of possible partners also harbor enormous potential that companies should not do without the study shows nearly two thirds of the companies do not yet have a digital transformation strategy more than half of them also have no plans to

insights into the manufacturing execution systems innova in seafood processing sites deep sea vessels and enterprise wide digital transformation to businesses from albert sanford starting his own auckland fishing business in to aquaculture farms vessels sites nationwide and about people today sanford is new zealand s oldest and largest fishing company but don t let the company s age fool you sanford puts modern technology innovation and sustainability first to make sure their position as seafood industry leaders will remain for at least another years june saw sanford go live with the biggest system change they have seen as a business the scope of the change has been to implement manufacturing execution systems mes innova into seafood processing sites and deep sea vessels and enterprise wide microsoft d f o to the nz and australian businesses including multiple inventory holding locations and several toll manufacturing sites the project was originally scoped in and had to contend with design requirements and early build and integrations being completed during the covid lockdown periods from a supply chain perspective the project was complex given the range of vertically integrated value chains that exist in the business and the need to ensure a high bar in traceability due to regulatory requirements across the seafood sector there was also a requirement to improve the visibility of products in transit and integrate with customers and logistics services suppliers accurate product costing given the nature of primary production and disaggregation of seafood and the cost to serve were also requirements d was seen as a platform on which the business could grow into the future and add additional functionality once the core was embedded other areas to be further explored include integrated business planning ibp and asset management some of the key learnings to come from the project have been the need for strong program infrastructure ways of working project management tools resources as well as strong governance and project management leadership having executive sponsorship and board support is key to alignment on project objectives and priorities once the scope is confirmed as there will always be choices to be made once the project starts and assumptions around resource and cost are tested it was important for sanford to complete a capability and capacity review of its resources and where different and additional skill sets were identified they were brought into the project the project has delivered growth in people s capabilities as they have had to find new ways of working across a fully integrated system and build more technical knowledge the d go live has been a huge change initiative for sanford which has impacted almost everyone throughout the organisation in some way over the last couple of years the build up to go live in terms of planning and data migration was significant all of sanford s inventory its purchasing and manufacturing integrations across its processing and storage sites went live simultaneously this was also made more complex by a complete overhaul of all its product master data the data mapping work involved in over skus across over inventory locations across rd party logistics rd party manufacturing vessels and sanford sites was in itself an epic piece of work understanding the importance of master data had been growing steadily over the project timeline and with several master data champions across the business the focus in this area had been a worthwhile investment integrations with mes and with other external partners were found to be more resource intensive and challenging than originally assumed having designs for both erp and mes in a state of flux at the same time presented some unique challenges for our integration teams in terms of pinning down filed mappings and building firm functional and technical design documents there was no blueprint for our erp to mes integration with the teams needing to iterate and make practical choices on the way through the level of collaboration required across our business program and partner teams was significant and a high degree of rework was experienced as we learned more and revisited optimized our design overall the integration team delivered all the temporary integrations mes to legacy erp and over long term integration points supporting mes to d and d to rd parties in collaboration with sealord and mpi sanford built an industry tool to manage and trade or allowable catch entitlement ace effectively quota with the intention that this product is made available commercially to nz fishing industry in the future we undertook a significant in house application build to automate our payroll calculations to crew and to contract fishers with our new crewpay solution now live and supporting regular payments the perseverance and work ethic across many has been a testament to sanford s culture and only through its people was the project able to come to a successful go live there is certainly more work to do to stabilise and optimise business processes and data so our business stakeholders must see the current and future benefits they have sought through this project we now have the start of a journey into the future to showcase and deliver our beautiful new zealand seafood to both local and international customers a reduction in paper and energy consumption time savings cost cuts and an improved customer experience are some of the benefits resulting from two process improvements introduced by the business transformation office the business process enablement bpe programme has developed forms to meet the majority of digital form needs for the university with staff encouraged to use the digital version rather than the former paper records working across the university the bpe programme has uncovered a total forms of which were designated as no longer required and have been digitised with an estimated form submissions annually the paper mountain soon builds up based on an average of two pages per paper form and assuming each paper form is printed out only twice this equates to a staggering pieces of paper each year the environmental cost of this is significant litres of water kilograms of waste and kilograms of wood these figures do not include the cost of packing and transporting paper nor storing paper or disposing of waste paper this amount of paper equates to a story building and costs with the additional cost to the university of for the maintenance of printers elspet garvey manager of the business transformation office says the digitisation of many forms along with an earlier good idea to set double sided printing as a default has made inroads into a paper based culture the business transformation office initiative nominated in the environmental sustainability category of the vice chancellor s excellence awards was described by the judges as an excellent initiative which was self started in response to a strategic plan target and effectively executed with widespread engagement the judges noted it provided university wide value with a focus on training and capacity building research based recommendations for companies to capitalize on their investments in the digital transformation of sales spanning various industries article originally appeared in harvard business review july august by silvio palumbo anddavid edelman what focus companies are investing heavily in digital transformation including of sales however many are struggling to capitalise on their efforts there is little research evidence and guidance on how to holistically transform sales leading to the implementation of random and incremental processes the aim of this article is to provide a prescriptive model based on a literature review and semi structured interviews with managers and salespeople across a range of industries the model is then applied to analyse the current state of digital transformation of sales processes in an international sample of companies n and highlight the distinctive features of the most successful companies with practical examples and actionable guidelines how details methods the literature review identifies two limitations of existing studies first is the predominant focus on selected phenomena such as the adoption of customer relationship management crm technology resulting in partial models that only cover one aspect of transformation second most studies have looked at digitalisation in terms of marketing strategies with relatively few considering its relevance for sales processes sales processes can be broken down into three preselling selling after sales phases and their subprocesses across people and departments to sum up salespeople need to manage multiple and complex activities in their interactions not only with customers but also inside their own organisations to conceptualize a model for the digitalisation of sales a qualitative study was conducted with managers and salespeople across different industries to determine the status quo of how digital technologies impact selling processes in practice rather than incorporating the three selling phases the resulting model distinguishes between the transformation digitalisation of customer interaction processes and internal processes and their accompanying information processes moreover an in depth analysis of the examples collected yielded six underlying themes of how technology alleviates the lack of knowledge speed reach and perceived value identified by interviewees these s pathways of digital transformation in sales are substitute supplement service simplify support and share for example if the main goal of the digital transformation is to increase efficiency in internal processes by addressing a lack of speed then companies may invest in digital technologies that help simplify processes mainly through automation the next stage of the study was a cross national quantitative survey study spanning the united states the united kingdom germany and italy the aim was to gauge how managerial practice perform ed against the prescriptive framework for managing the digital transformation of sales four categories of company were subsequently identified with regard to digital sales transformation leaders transformation laggards sales enablers and sales replacers the article concludes with three sets of guidelines for the managers of such companies whatever category they fall into so what first managers can use the prescriptive framework to steer their digital transformation endeavours companies should start by carefully mapping their sales processes juxtaposing the importance of each process against its current performance they can then focus further analyses on those processes that are highly important yet underperforming for these processes managers should identify critical pains that digitalisation can help resolve and choose digital pathways accordingly they can then implement key actions along with performance indicators second managers can identify where they sit in relation to the four categories to capitalise on strengths and remedy weaknesses last while these recommendations will facilitate a structured approach managers should be aware that their digital transformation endeavours are unlikely to be a sure fire success and change will take time experts from china singapore usa and new zealand came together recently to discuss and debate the transformative power of digital technology at an online research symposium hosted by the centre for digital enterprise code code is a new interdisciplinary research unit at the university of auckland researching topics including digital platforms digital sourcing and artificial intelligence to name just a few kicking the symposium off was steve james from countdown nz who spoke about the explosive growth in their online market during the covid lockdown the company has seen a mass acceleration in the digital space with over shoppers registering for online shopping in one night his advice before you start on a digital transformation which is a term thrown around lightly by organisations and invest in digital technology you really need to understand your business strategy and customer value proposition digital technology is merely a tool to support what you want to achieve as a business and so it s vital you know what that is do you really know what your customers want steve says digital transformation was always going to happen but the pandemic has accelerated its implementation us speaker josh buckley defined digital transformation as the adoption of digital technology to transform services or businesses replacing non digital or manual processes with digital processes or replacing older technology with newer technology in order to amplify and enable human potential hailing from the construction industry josh emphasised the focus must be on effectiveness and efficiency ask yourself why and how am i doing this he emphasized that introducing new technology for its own sake is meaningless instead introduce a new idea or a new effective workflow and then find the technology that will enable that branding and marketing expert derek sun from oppo defined digital transformation as applying technology to create significant competitive advantages if there are no significant competitive advantages created then i don t think it can be called transformative it s incremental progression rather than transformation leveraging digital platforms can create new business models like uber or airbnb ultimately its about the value that technology brings to companies this requires continuous learning be curious about everything the second session focused on digital sustainability led by the president of tcs asia pacific girish ramachandran and kpmg nz cio cowan pettigrew in this session speakers expressed concern about the lack of commitment to sustainability objectives and outlined their vision for harnessing the power of digital to improve sustainability on june the centre of digital enterprise and the centre for supply chain management jointly presented a webinar on digital transformation in this webinar christopher ting capacity optimisation manager at auckland airport shared his insights and experience on how the capacity optimisation team used advance digital technologies to help organisations operating at auckland airport to maintain excellent guest experience and to provide a safe environment for staff and guests more than any other industries covid has had a rapid and catastrophic impact on global travel and tourism despite reductions in airlines routes and travelling guests auckland airport has continued to focus on digital transformation communicating with internal teams and external agencies they provided seamless guest journeys at the international and domestic terminals in the covid landscape the operations division has used digital transformation to more efficiently provide reliable planning information for the airport community and to assist with demand led staffing resource allocations they drove the adoption of advanced analytics and modelling

underperforming for these processes managers should identify critical pains that digitalisation can help resolve and choose digital pathways accordingly they can then implement key actions along with performance indicators second managers can identify where they sit in relation to the four categories to capitalise on strengths and remedy weaknesses last while these recommendations will facilitate a structured approach managers should be aware that their digital transformation endeavours are unlikely to be a sure fire success and change will take time overview project report research snapshot research team publications contact an analysis of unequal connectivity in carlton housing estate melbourne victoria this project was funded by a melbourne social equity institute seed funding grant and by the australian communications consumer action network accan australia has some of the best internet coverage globally and yet in approximately million australians had no internet connection this reveals significant limitations in access digital ability and affordability despite major infrastructure investments accan while recent research suggests that these numbers have dropped due to the online demands that arose during the covid pandemic acma access affordability and adequacy of connection for some citizens remain out of reach due to a range of barriers to ensure that everyone has equal opportunity to use digital technologies and thus to ensure access to social and economic opportunities and essential government services targeted investments to reduce digital inequality are necessary digital inclusion in australia is influenced by a person s income age education level and residential location this report demonstrates that digital inequality is not measured by access to internet alone but also by quality of service and internet providers accountability in the face of poor customer experience focus on the national broadband network nbn in australia has led policymakers to overlook the many people who access the internet predominantly with their smartphones or who rely on their smartphones to augment poor home internet connections the roll out of the nbn has led many to assume that high quality internet has been brought into everyone s reach this assumption means that the consequences of poor connectivity risk becoming less visible and exacerbates concerns for the people who continue to experience digital exclusion working with principles of co design with community partners and carlton public housing residents we conducted a case study of how people manage digital inequality our data analysis revealed that people were not as digitally connected during the pandemic and ensuing lockdowns as the services upon which they depended assumed they were online home schooling demanded a device to person ratio and many low income families needed to buy or request assistance to meet this demand additional constraints were felt in access to employment and in essential services such as health and income support centrelink download the page report including the executive summary and recommendations download download the understanding

their land information system the road map towards better land administration is based on local needs as well as international best practices university of melbourne researchers have prepared a customised road map of projects to modernise every aspect of indonesia s land information system for the indonesian ministry of land affairs and spatial planning kementerian agraria dan tata ruang badan pertanahan nasional modern land information systems give clarity around land rights and support land administration sustainable development and urban planning the university of melbourne s centre for spatial data infrastructures and land administration csdila has previously worked on similar projects with the victorian government the world bank and the united nations committee of experts for global geospatial information management un ggim the centre for spatial data infrastructures and land administration team is helping the indonesian government to move from paper based land administration to digital based land administration says professor abbas rajabifard the lead of the land information modernisation project land administration connects physical information about the land s features with legal information about the rights restrictions and responsibilities this is done through a series of steps and protocols all of which the research team has considered for modernisation based on the indonesian government s vision and international best practices professor rajabifard and his team have developed a customised road map of projects to modernise indonesia s land information system the partnership has also included training and capacity building across the range of people involved in indonesian land administration processes from land surveyors to government executives we are grateful for the training organised by csdila in which provided us with the opportunity to gain knowledge from csdila s experts in the field of land management and cadastre this knowledge has allowed us to solidify our practical knowledge and increase the capacity of our staff to assist in the organisation of various activities in the ministry says himawan arief sugoto senior advisor to the minister the university of melbourne team is now working on a pilot for a modernised land information system called smartland indonesia land rights form the basis of world economies modernising land administration gives clarity around land rights in disasters like floods or landslides paper records can be lost or destroyed the government may not know who the land rights should be returned to digital records also allow more information to be stored and connected and having complete land information available across jurisdictions is important for emergency management urban planning and land managem ent it could reveal a community s resilience to natural disasters for example a community could be at risk of flooding due to the land s topography and have poor access to road networks to escape modern land information systems can also power sustainable development digital records allow governments to better analyse how land is distributed the equal access to services and facilities is one part of the sustainable development indicators says professor rajabifard many of the united nations sustainable development goals are connected to land better land information allows better measurement of progress towards those goals the world bank recognises land rights as a cornerstone of world economies in and it sent a group of indonesian executives to melbourne for a workshop on best practices in land administration and what modernisation of land administration looks like the indonesian ministry of agrarian affairs and spatial planning asked the university of melbourne team to support their project management office on their land system modernisation journey we started exploring all the business processes on different levels like the federal government the regional and also the local governments in different jurisdictions across the entire indonesia says dr soheil sabri the manager of the land information modernisation project many changes are needed for a fully modernised land information system even in law for example in the indonesian context the land title should be printed and stamped by the legal office dr sabri says to fully digitise the indonesian land administration system that law would need to change the road map built by the university of melbourne proposed a suite of projects to address similar challenges and opportunities modernising all aspects of the land administration workflow beyond digitising a paper based system smartland indonesia may eventually integrate digital twin technology a digital twin a virtual representation of real world entities and processes synchronised with its real world equivalent could help convert a d land information system into d giving a more holistic view of structures

funded by the victorian government land office to explore transitioning its paper based land administration to a digital system the victoria eplan was a pilot project launched in in partnership with land use victoria it focused on the automatic validation of data collected and submitted to the land office that is one of the flagship projects that converted the research into practice over those five years the team has learned a lot of new knowledge and generated that knowledge as a repository for moving forward in different directions says professor rajabifard develope d countries like

reduce the climate impact of the built environment the legal profession is finally experiencing the digital disruption that has swept through so many industries over the last decade it s transforming all aspects of lawyering creating new ways of working in new markets with new roles and opening up new opportunities while traditional conventions wane law graduates who understand the impact of digital innovations and are comfortable working with technology will be at an advantage with employers so legal education needs to provide students with the technical skills to thrive in the digital world and also the ability to navigate the complex ethical legal and social implications of new technologies while our future lawyers need to work in a digital world it remains all the more important to recognise the value of some important elements of traditional legal education including research critical thinking and analytical skills this blend of old and new capabilities is the best chance we have to thrive in a rapidly changing world there are areas where the digital transformation will be significant we re already seeing the impact in discovery where artificial intelligence is both replacing work product from lawyers and at the same time improving the experience of law practice other changes might create new types of legal work in new markets for example providing online high volume low cost advice to under served constituencies at melbourne law school for example the students in our law apps class work in teams with not for profit clients to develop on line legal information sources to provide assistance to those who might otherwise struggle to understand their legal rights and duties other aspects of the law however will remain more complex and nuanced and require greater human input than predicted by those who foresee the end of traditional law firms as legal educators we need to draw on the best of the past while being innovative about responding to the future some of the traditional values of high quality legal education remain pertinent maybe even increasingly so in a rapidly changing world these elements should not be sacrificed when looking at reforms although the precise way in which they are taught may need some modification the nature of legal research for example might be changing but the need for high quality research skills is not a careless and ill defined search can give rise to a torrent of barely relevant unimportant materials from around the world the poorly trained law graduate haplessly reproduces as much of it as possible hoping that the right answer will mysteriously arise from the sea of information students must understand the questions they are researching have a deep familiarity with the best research tools for the particular task understand the hierarchies at play in terms of court structures and forms of law and have good judgment about which sources to use and when none of these skills is straightforward and all of them require a seriou s educational effort both in law school and in professional training creating opportunities for serious deep and structured interdisciplinary experiences is another important aspect of contemporary legal education it is likely interdisciplinary groups will give rise to the most innovative workplaces and solve the most intractable problems of our time for a profession in which development has tended to be evolutionary and incremental for much of its history the legal profession is now faced with a pace of change that has put serious pressure on many lawyers as law firms examine their practices and adjust to the new world other competitors and new ways of providing legal advice emerge the pattern of change and challenge to the existing ways of doing things is likely to continue indefinitely law schools likewise face challenges in responding to this new environment with the number of graduate places for young lawyers diminishing they must focus on both readying their students for those places and also preparing them for other roles in which their knowledge and skills can be used in adapting to meet these new challenges it is important law schools recognise that some of the traditional skills they impart to students will continue to be valuable for a long time to come but neither can they close their eyes to the environment into which students are graduating and they need to be innovative and responsive in creating opportunities for students to develop new skills sets that will set them up to succeed even as the expectations of lawyers continues to shift over time to mark law week may pursuit is looking at some of the issues facing the profession in the st century banner image lady justice by alex proimos from sydney australia wikimedia can knowing too much harm us when it comes to medicine in some cases yes absolutely finding and treating diseases early saves lives and reduces health costs it is why health systems have been increasingly undertaking proactive screening administering clinical tests on individuals who don t have any symptoms but may be at risk examples include screening for diseases like bowel cancer or breast cancer the ubiquity of digital technologies in our lives has the potential to take proactive screening to a new level digital screening this involves using information collected by our smartphones smartwatches keyboards social networks and wearable technology and analysing it using artificial intelligence algorithms to identify at risk individuals for example the early onset of parkinson s disease could be identified from the changing patterns of how someone types while the risk of heart problems can be identified from abnormal heart rhythms detected by a smartwatch while all this may sound good the problem is that proactive screening can find things that might not be worth finding there is overwhelming evidence that some diagnostic tests used in screening can find abnormalities that while meeting the current definition of a disease might have never made some people sick these diseases that would have never generated any problems are what we call cases of overdiagnoses and can lead to unnecessary and sometimes harmful treatments and the emergence of digital screening could make this problem worse overdiagnosis as a phenomenon has been seen in many well known diseases from some common cancers to attention deficit disorder the most common scenario of overdiagnosis is when we actively seek diseases in asymptomatic patients especially among healthier segments of the population for example in some countries screening for thyroid cancer has led to a two fold increase in the incidence of thyroid cancer but no change in mortality in other words the screening hasn t reduced deaths similarly studies have shown that screening for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in children can lead to simply the youngest children in a school class being diagnosed overdiagnosis has been observed for many cancers including prostate cancer and breast cancer as well as conditions like chronic kidney disease gestational diabetes high blood pressure and autism spectrum disorder the extent of overdiagnosis is difficult to quantify but one report has suggested that an estimated per cent of all cancers in australia may be cases of overdiagnosis one reason behind overdiagnosis is the constant advance of technology with newer more sensitive tests being developed among the latest advances in medicine is the possibility of using the massive amount of data we generate every day to find clues that might point to undiagnosed diseases throughout our day we use smartphones type emails interact on social media and count our steps on our smartwatches using artificial intelligence the data can be used to find patterns that might help us detect diseases at an earlier stage the collection and use of medical data raise ethical concerns like those of privacy and data security nonetheless this is a very exciting time and many benefits will probably emerge from these technologies but just as with traditional diagnostic methods overdiagnosis is still a risk that should be addressed so what can we do in our recently published paper we propose using data banks of longitudinal patient information data collected over long periods of time to analyse the historical trajectories of different diseases and identify those subgroups of patients who won t be significantly affected if at all by a given disease this data driven approach could be used to improve disease definitions considering patient trajectories and identify the clinical attributes that might in the future allow clinicians to more accurately distinguish a diagnosis from an overdiagnosis in a pilot study we conducted using a us hospital database with hundreds of thousands of hospital admissions we trained an artificial intelligence algorithm to predict which patients were likely to develop sepsis in the next hours sepsis is a complication of an infection in which the body s own immune response begins to damage tissues and organs we then looked at the patients flagged by the algorithm who actually went on to develop sepsis based on official diagnostic criteria among them we found that almost per cent of them had trajectories that appeared to be identical to those who never went on to develop sepsis this suggests that we need more work on defining what is and what isn t sepsis the huge amounts of data that technology allows us to collect and analyse is an opportunity to better identify people early who need treatment before they become sick but we also need to use big data to ensure we aren t taking perfectly well people and turning them into sick patients banner getty images futurists tell us we are on the brink of a fourth industrial revolution this one is all about the digital and technological disruption of how we used to do things previous industrial revolutions saw many blue collar manufacturing jobs replaced by machines or disappear overseas to low labour cost countries developed economies like australia successfully transitioned their labour force to white collar service jobs now these jobs are themselves under threat and the financial services sector is not immune many transactional services are moving online or are being replaced by offshore call centres and increasingly by virtual services robots or artificial intelligence systems yet the finance sector has also embraced and thrived on the opportunities created by digital disruption the traditional banking sector in particular is constantly challenged by new nimble and highly competitive operators and must either change the tune of its service provision or face commercial oblivion the finance sector has in fact been remarkably resilient to change in the ongoing capitalist battle of creative destruction financial institutions seem to have had markedly greater longevity than manufacturing corporations that could be explained by a sustained lack of competition but it may also reflect an ability to adapt to new circumstances and adopt new technology like atms and internet banking whenever and wherever they arise there is no need for the financial establishment to significantly invest in research and development itself banking corporations have adopted a similar strategy to big pharmaceuticals let independent niche operators innovate and create start ups and ventures and when they succeed simply buy them for example the successful australian upstarts specialising in low cost mortgage lending aussie and rams were eventually bought by the traditional banks cba and westpac respectively the sector s resilience is not just due to an ability to cope remarkably well with external pressure finance has become increasingly innovative and continuously reinvents itself to reduce the costs of regulation as well as the delivery of better products and services for customers regulators and legislators often struggle to keep pace with the latest developments in investment assets financial advice and risk management that often leaves new providers operating in a regulatory vacuum that only gets filled once things have gone terribly wrong or once lobbying pressure by the sector itself becomes too strong to ignore the cost of unregulated innovation on the public could be significant consider for example the fact that financial innovations like portfolio insurance and collateralised debt obligations contributed to the stock market crash and the global financial crisis respectively rather than wait for legislation and regulation to catch up we should therefore ask ourselves whether the ethics underpinning these innovations pass the morality test digital technology will arguably improve market access for new niche financial institutions as well as competition and make markets and services more efficient robot trading and advice can significantly reduce fees improve transparency and make financial services more accessible there is even a suggestion that robot finance will democratise the sector and lead to a more just and fair financial system for all human foibles and manifestations of conflicts of interest can simply be switched off taking out human interaction could transform a possibly immoral finance sector to an entirely amoral one where moral considerations simply have no role to play unfortunately this dehumanisation of finance raises its own ethical concerns as finance sector legislation regulation often significantly lags developments and practices how can we be sure that financial entrepreneurs even consider the ethical implications of their new business models after all financial institutions often innovate to reduce the cost of regulation on conducting financial transactions these concerns extend from breaches of client information privacy to more generally neglect of a duty to clients perhaps surprisingly they seem to have increased with the introduction of digital technology service platforms while the platforms are notionally neutral they don t recognise a client s financial sophistication or lack thereof this digital revolution is rapidly replacing physical markets and bank branches and employees with online platforms and smartphone technology even the world of financial advice which is still clinging to face to face transactions might well be replaced by robot advice in the near future the platforms are cheap to develop easy to implement and effectively marketed this creates an entirely new competitive landscape with start ups and small players specialising in specific services instantly becoming competitive entrants whereas regulators used to impose the same regimes on incumbents and newcomers who were thereby disadvantaged they now seem to provide regulatory exception to new initiatives public distrust of the finance sector has weakened the lobbying power of the incumbents and convinced the regulators to encourage innovation and competition by newcomers the price paid however is possibly unchecked unethical behaviour by the innovators this is an edited extract from a matter of trust the practice of ethics in finance by paul kofman and clare payne published by melbourne university press more information is available here banner image getty images minute read in a recent webinar panellists discussed how the application of technology can address critical ecological and urban design issues like adapting cities to climate change modern city planning needs a great deal of data big problems like adapting our cities to the impacts of climate change require complex solutions digital technologies help urban designers pool different sources of data and consider their problems using systems thinking rather than approaching them one project at a time in our recent infrastructure webinar integrated design for resilient urban landscapes four panellists in conversation with city of melbourne s mark allan discussed how the application of technology can address critical ecological and urban design issues watch webinar chief among the digital tools to tackle complex urban design issues are urban digital twins a digital twin is a virtual representation of the built and natural environment of cities the living entities with them and the processes that make cities tick like transport networks there are three main components in an urban digital twin said panellist dr soheil sabri senior research fellow in urban analytics at the university of melbourne dr sabri managed the fishermans bend digital twin project the first urban digital twin component is the real world the second is the digital world where real world objects and processes are represented the third is the underpinning technology that connects the real world to the digital world and enables synchronisation between the two why are they useful an urban environment is a complex dynamic environment where housing environment transport and many other factors work together any time you make a change to one you re affecting all eight or nine other systems that are at work on the streets and in our public realm said panellist dr nano langenheim lecturer in landscape architecture and urban design at the university of melbourne urban designers can use digital twins to plug in data from several different sources to understand how these systems interact where relevant data is available in open data resources urban planning projects could save time and money however researchers and planners often collect data for a specific purpose data collected for understanding the free flow of traffic while representing the same streets may not have the information another researcher needs about footpath quality what we are seeing through digital transformation is certainly a pressure on maturity in the marketplace for understanding what the information management requirements are at the end of the project said panellist mr james barrow mixed reality and digital engineering lead at ghd good data management standards that help define the type accuracy currency and purpose of data collected can ensure its longevity and that longevity starts with curiosity about what other users needs are mr barrow explained ensurin g the usability of data beyond a single project increases its value city planners are already tackling the impacts of climate change increased rainfall rising sea levels and increasing temperatures the city of melbourne is using digital technologies and data in projects like increasing tree canopy cover and understanding the microclimates around the city to combat the effects of extreme heat events heat is in fact a more dangerous killer of people in australia than any other natural hazard said ms tiffany crawford co chief heat officer at the city of melbourne but she believes the solutions to climate change are available what it now requires is different thinking innovation and partnership i think that the great minds watching this and present today are a big part of that keep going ms crawford said learn more about infrastructure research first published on january technology continues to transform the practices of every organisation around the world but if we look specifically at the legal profession these digital transformations can bring unanticipated legal and ethical risks in house legal departments used to be viewed as a hallowed black box and although it was unclear what they did their decisions were highly regarded in recent years in house lawyers have extended out into new areas of business like environmental social and governance where they have a larger role in designing and influencing the rest of their company general counsels are now devoting more time to strategic emphasis and less time to day to day business as janet taylor hall chief executive of the legal service provider cognia law states in house lawyers engage with the sales team or procurement department sitting down with them to develop templates contracts or negotiation rules most importantly there s a been a major change in the deployment of technology by in house legal departments to gather data analysing this data can identify emerging trends and provide early notice of larger problems like an increase in the number of new lawsuit claims a report by the corporate legal operations consortium cloc shows more than half of the participants around per cent answered that their organisation views the legal department as totally integrated into their strategy and business according to only three per cent of respondents the in house legal department provides strictly legal advice australian businesses are now at risk of significantly higher cyber attacks because of their reliance on web based applications but when it comes to cyber threat response only per cent of companies have a comprehensive cyber threat response strategy that involves their legal departments cyber breaches can result not only in significant financial loss but also in reputational damage so the intervention of a competent legal team can mitigate those risks as an example of one of these privacy breaches human rights watch hrw has accused adobe connect application and minecraft education edition of violating their privacy policies and collecting children s personal data for non educational purposes this highlights the need for in house lawyers with extensive understanding of technology who are able to predict potential legal breaches and guide their employers throughout the early stages of new technology development australia s privacy act currently under review is out of date in the digital age while legislators attempt to amend and supplement the relevant legislation to become more adaptable to technological change lawyers continue to face legal challenges related to evolving digitalisation and it s hard to say if these adaptions of the law really go far enough recently consumer group choice investigated whether australian retailers kmart bunnings and the good guys were violating the privacy act by using facial recognition technology to capture and collect a faceprint of customers who entered selected stores around per cent of consumers were unaware that businesses used video cameras for this purpose stores using facial recognition technology in this way is similar to gathering your fingerprints or dna every time you shop under the privacy act biometric data gathered by facial recognition technology is considered sensitive personal data clearly existing laws are lacking when it comes to protecting us from potentially harmful facial recognition technology in these cases it s not clear whether the decision to deploy this technology wasn t run past the legal teams in their respective organisations whether the legal teams under estimated the potential public backlash or if they didn t have sufficient understanding of the nuances of facial recognition to realise the potential risks or perhaps some combination of all three in any case having tighter involvement with a better informed legal team may have raised concerns earlier or led to these organisations informing their customers in a more transparent way it is very important to understand and examine how in house lawyers become involved in procuring designing deploying and overseeing the emerging digital technologies in their firms and how they mitigate risks associated with emerging technologies what is unclear is whether current legal education and training is sufficient for lawyers providing advice on emerging technology firstly for many new applications of emerging technology there may be several areas of existing legislation that apply but most of these were designed without these technological advances in mind secondly often no precedent exists for many issues regarding emerging technology and this puts lawyers in a position of needing to understand the implications of emerging technology and provide legal and ethical advice without clear legislation and precedents only once lawyers and law students understand the underlying legal and technical frameworks of emerging digital technology and are well equipped to respond to technology related issues will they be able to mitigate the legal risks associated with them the centre for ai and digital ethics caide is launching a new project to ensure that lawyers understand the underlying legal and technical frameworks of emerging digital technology the four year project new legal thinking for emerging technologies is funded by the menzies foundation under the ninian stephen law program the first phase is to understand how lawyers currently address these problems if you are an in house lawyer who has given legal or ethical advice on technology we invite you for a one hour online interview please contact dr fahimeh abedi abedi f unimelb edu au if you are interested and available for an

manager for the shared infrastructure services programme is brendan donnelly the programme will be delivering on the work of the it infrastructure services review and will facilitate a more connected and collaborative it infrastructure across the university work has begun to consult with colleagues across the divisions to determine priorities for this academic year based on the initiatives from

during the next few weeks and months the data programme manager is alex gray this programme will implement the new data strategy which aims to improve data governance through improved processes and technology and make that data more easily available through improved bi reporting signposting to reports and access to data via integration s these improvements support other digital transformation and it projects university strategic initiatives such as professional service reviews and value for money review and reduce burden on staff we asked professor sir nigel shadbolt for his views on oxford and ai nigel is principal of jesus college professorial research fellow and head of human centred computing in computer science university of oxford email sso required the new framework will create greater alignment to university priorities simplify and speed up decision making and put more emphasis on user focused digital experiences it will also provide a clearer view across the institution of what digital services are available to staff and students and at what cost as part of the foundation phase of oxford university s digital transformation programme we identified that one of the most important success criteria for a sustained and real impact of any digital changes is the governance and delivery of digital services and infrastructure accordingly a working group was set up to consider the existing it governance and options for the future following its review the group has made recommendations on digital governance how we decide what to do operations how we do it and on organisational structures how we structure the organisation to operate effectively the review found that the way the university governs it is too narrowly focused on just the it part and not the business part the proposed governance framework shifts the focus from it technology to governance embedded more in the university mission and business and extends the scope to include data information and cybersecurity the review of our existing it governance approach found several themes including silos there are too many committees operating in silos siloed and slower decision making project based funding not effectively tensioned against other needs not sufficiently tied into university priorities the committees lack integration with business in terms of strategic input and alignment with strategic need prioritisation and implementation current it board model is not working appropriately portfolio scrutiny group key decision making body not enough user focus user design not embedded in projects sufficiently early insufficient engagement with divisional structures not enough focus on data data governance is floating in our governance touched on in various committees focused on in none complexity the joint subcommittees model does not interact effectively with other university committees to ensure strategy priorities driven by business need it committee is not properly plugged into our governance in general does not lead to process simplification doesn t enable a service improvement model not enough focus on cybersecurity prioritisation of cybersecurity investments is not properly overseen or considered it is considered by jisag which reports into security subcommittee but we need clearer focus on cybersecurity services lack of continuity and consistency staff engaged in project delivery may be moved to deliver in other areas without the knowledge of the associated subcommittee over time the portfolio committees will oversee the delivery of services through service streams with responsible owners for the management of the service streams and service stream delivery teams who wil l maintain and improve the services in time for mt a new information and digital committee idc will replace the existing it committee the idc will be responsible for strategy and policy related to digital services and infrastructure data information and cybersecurity five portfolio committees will be created that report to idc they are responsible for services in the areas of education research engagement and dissemination administration and technology the new committee structure will be put in place to begin from mt a portfolio has two modes governance and delivery this mode includes overseeing approving monitoring governing tracking deciding and guiding projects services and spend all portfolios will transition to the new governance model from mt a new way of delivering projects and services by bringing resources teams together into delivery groups for the particular portfolio over time this will help to deepen the expertise and knowledge of colleagues working within a particular portfolio the new operating model will be piloted with the education portfolio in mt the other portfolio committees will focus only on governance and not delivery at this this time this will require identifying the portfolio support and service stream owners and providing guidance training and support as we work through the implementation of the new model at the same time key assets will need to be created that will be required by the committees and teams a review of the pilot will be completed in trinity term which will inform the further development of the remaining portfolios the new digital governance framework provides a clearer view across the institution of what digital services are available to staff and students and at what cost at present this information is not available and sits in many budget lines across the institution the aim of the proposed changes to governance and the operating model are to shift the delivery of services to be more closely aligned with the business strategy and user needs the change to the funding and delivery model has been made to allow a more agile and continuous improvement approach and to move away from our existing project driven way of working the model is based on service stream delivery teams which will allow us to build experienced teams knowledgeable in both the business need and digital capabilities most importantly this aims to reduce siloed decision making process whilst at the same time increasing the capability to prioritise spend effectively the digital transformation programme team will continue to exist and will support delivery of the programme during this transition period a dedicated change management team will oversee the setting up of the portfolios the creation of the assets to support the portfolios providing the training and support for the committees assisting in provision of training for service stream owners and in the specific case of t he education portfolio supporting the service stream delivery teams as well the change management team will also be responsible for the delivery in due course of the changes recommended by the it infrastructure service review we recognise that there will be a significant period of transition to bed in the new governance project and service delivery identifying and responding to skill gaps and potentially implementing organisational change to support service and new governance delivery the full implementation of the governance framework and operating model is expected to take at least months and possibly as long as months this may appear to be a slow transition but the suggested timing takes into account the potential organisational operational changes that will be the outcome of the it infrastructure service review and the continuing series of activities within the digital transformation programme the implementation of the new governance framework and operating model are transformative in how we envisage digital services and infrastructure and how they are integrated into planning and embedded to ensure the institution is digitally fit for the future once this transition is complete which may take up to two years the digital transformation programme becomes business as usual and the programme team can be disbanded if you have any questions or concerns please speak with your existing committee chair or line manager or you can email the programme

in compliance with law of presented in the version of the peti which establishes the guiding document for projects of technology as a contribution to the fulfillment of institutional objectives based on the enterprise architecture program in its second cycle sgc this document describes the actions undertaken within the aei aei for its acronym architecture institutional business designed since through the support of the cifi cifi for its acronym research center of the faculty of engineering of the university of the andes the aei program was divided into phases the first phase was based on the socialization of basic concepts of aei through the elaboration of the diagnosis of the situation in as is architecture and the joint generation of the situation or state desired architecture to be the main product of this phase was the preparation of the roadmap of projects grouped into major initiatives on which the sgc had to guide its efforts and strategies phase ii includes the prioritization of architecture domains in order to design and launch the pilot of a highly scalable solution for earthquake related information and transferring appropriately the petroleum information bank bip between the national agency of hydrocarbons anh and the sgc finally phase iii continues with the implementation of projects that allow the strengthening of information systems data and technological infrastructure at the institutional level sgc the results of cycle of the aei led to the development of technological tools web platforms information systems geoportals and geoviewers that integrate and they provide geoscientific information for internal and external users next some of them are presented the geoscientific information integration engine miig it brings together the official historical information in each project the bip is the official repository of colombia to safeguard and manage all the technical information resulting from the exploratory and hydrocarbon production activities that take place in the national territory the mass movement information system simma allows load manage and consult the mass movements that occurred in colombia for the comprehensive risk management territorial and environmental planning and planning desa development the bd explora database centralizes geochemical information data for investigations and characterization of mineral resources additionally development of a digital transformation model of geographic data through of information and communications technologies icts during this cycle the strengthening and optimization of the infrastructure was carried out technological by adapting a main data center for the operation and an alternate data center storage communication capacity and availability solutions for data geoscientists in the developed tools sgc in the sgc updates the aei and proposes a second cycle focused in data analytics for management which gathers purifies and transforms data to structured systems to describe explore and analyze information through control boards that support monitoring follow up evaluation and control of objectives process projects users and resources of the qms on the other hand data analytics geoscientists allows applying multidisciplinary knowledge through processes of analysis interpretation communication of spatial data of different origin and format geostatistics d and d modeling and visualization so that researchers can understand explain explore and predict the characteristics and behaviors of the subsoil the potential of its resources and threats of geological origin sgc the sgc within the framework of the initiatives to contribute to the aei has structured the ide geoscientific aimed at facilitating the availability and access to spatial information to do this it has been based on the guidelines of the colombian data infrastructure icde of the igac which is the government strategy designed to integrate and provide geographic information that promotes the generation of value in the territory sgc in the icde presents the results obtained from the assessment carried out on the ide sdi for its acronym spatial data infrastructure institutional of the sgc which does not it was formalized at the time of the evaluation icde the methodology was based on the execution of interviews and work tables with the qms staff in order to identify the degree of progress regarding the components organizational human resources information standards and ict services from the themes and indices defined as part of the maturity levels project of a sdi the maturity level was based on the weighting of each of the components whose sum is likewise at each level in total a value was defined minimum depending on the themes identified in each one finally the study and diagnosis of the institutional ide named as geoscientific ide showed as resulted in an advanced level of maturity as a product of what was presented in chapter compose organizational and information entities optimized human resources medium ict standards and services advanced icde however the icde recommends generate technical specifications for the products that are generated keep them updated standards in accordance with current international regulations enhance the integration and systems developed to generate analysis tools continue with the enterprise architecture project strengthen internal participation in the definition of projects in addition to citizen and private company participation it is required an information government articulated with business architecture and government digital the above recommendations are tasks the sgc has proposed to solve through some proposals and initiatives continuing with the strategies proposed by the sgc for digital transformation and management of the entity s data was carried out through the cifi of the university of the andes the first evaluation of the data maturity level with the purpose of knowing the diagnosis of the qms in this regard and based on it define a path for improvement in the points that are weak in the measurement uniandes the diagnosis of the maturity level of the qms showed that it is at level called repeatable according to the framework data management maturity dmm model of the cmmi institute this level is defined as the process is sufficiently developed and different people execute more or less the same procedures no there is no formal communication or development of competencies and capacities of the procedures and responsibility is individual there is a great dependence on knowledge that individuals have and therefore there is a probability of error important uniandes the dmm data maturity model applied is composed of questions about different aspects of qms data management to carry out the diagnose the current state of data management maturity and provide guidance and recommendations of best practices to implement to achieve maturity levels superiors in data management uniandes development of a digital transformation model of geographic data through of information and communications technologies icts figure result of the data management maturity level for the qms source uniandes considering the above it is evident that the actions undertaken by the sgc in terms of digital transformation have been constant and are framed mainly in the aei however based on experience as far as set out in the sgc document peti in the icde recommendations and in the results of the evaluation of the level of data maturity for the qms carried out by the university of the andes in the data has a probability of error important and in some cases they lack order completeness coherence harmonization low level of detail and accuracy according to the above is it possible to integrate data by implementing geoscientific information analysis services is it possible to develop a model to the transformation of geographic type data to answer the previous questions it is appropriate to propose the integration of components based on icts with protocols and quality standards in the acquisition management and production of geographic data that allows supporting decision making decisions and adopt an innovative approach based on rigorous and reliable data and based on technological trends as tools for planning and management of the territory as a contribution to the solution of the problem evidenced by the diagnosis at the level national and institutional a model for chapter is proposed in this

and also enable integration management and analysis efficient of them in the current technological ecosystem conceptual and methodological approach digital transformation has been evaluated from different perspectives and scenarios which which involves diverse scopes and applications for this reason the conceptual review is develops in accordance with the objectives set out in this work this synthesis allows relate to the terms and main axes of the research for this work the main perspective is digital transformation models for geographical data however as evidenced in the previous section and based on the elaborated diagnosis there is little literature that frames protocols methods or tools for the transformation of this type of data in that sense according to the oecd digital transformation refers to the effects economic and social aspects of digitization and digitalization fingering is the conversion of analogue data and processes into a machine readable format digitization is the use of digital technologies and data as well as their interconnection which generates new activities or changes in existing ones for which a series of initiatives to adopt a digital government and close the digital gaps identified in the member countries of the organization oecd according to vial digital transformation aims to provide changes significant through the combination of computing communication information and connectivity mainly impacting industries and society some organizations see digital transformation as a means to optimize business processes and reduce costs while others they see it as a perspective to design new value by providing services that do not exist dremel et al the modification or adaptation of information management or business models to new technologies trigger changes in consumer behaviors and of society parviainen et al development of a model for digital transformation of geographic data through of information and

furthermore great advances in technologies and aforementioned processes have created a digital it economy which features both business opportunities as business risks forcing companies to innovate or face the consequences boardman kpn under this approach and considering that digital transformation drives digitalization and since digitalization uses data and technologies it is appropriate to address icts for which tello mentions that they are a term that explores all forms of technology used to create store exchange and process information in its various forms such as such as data voice conversations still or moving images presentations multimedia and other forms in this regard cruz pérez et al affirm that icts are producing innovation in various social spheres however these changes do not always indicate a rejection to previous technologies or means but in some cases a kind of of symbiosis with other media in the document profiling the digital transformation in latin america published by the oecd mentions the most important technologies and applications that drive the current digital transformation which are the smartphone the internet of things iot big data analysis big data artificial intelligence ai blockchain or distributed ledger technology dlt on the other hand they add the open source software g networks robotics grid computing grid and neural computing virtual

transformation of the governments of countries barbero et al in summary digital transformation has positively impacted technology and methods of processing and representing geographic data promoting a greater usability of public data and the development of technical solutions to specific problems in geographic data science chapter rq where is the greatest development in transformation models digital and who have been its main authors and rq what are the main fields of application of digital transformation models the growing diffusion of digital technologies especially in information systems production is giving rise to a new industrial paradigm usually called industry i previously mentioned kagermann in the core of i is the implementation of cyber physical systems cps for industrial production it is that is networks of microcomputers sensors and actuators embedded in materials machines or products that are connected along the value chain porter heppelmann and the availability of sophisticated systems to process and analyze big data in real time simulation augmented reality systems integration cloud computing cybersecurity and additive manufacturing are other technologies well known i enablers bellantuono et al lorenz et al all these technologies significantly expand the production possibilities and consumption and represent a disruptive technological change more specifically i generates new value propositions for highly personalized products or differentiated well synchronized combinations of products and services and added value bellantuono et al i is indeed a paradigm enabled by technology which is profoundly changing the way companies organize their processes and create value for customers companies are becoming more aware that digital technologies enable completely new business models and lead to the reconfiguration of the structure of all sectors leaving out those companies that will not be able to adapt to change bellantuono et al therefore it is essential that companies innovate and rethink their business models business burmeister et al ibarra et al as well as innovate their processes and products to take advantage of the challenges and growth opportunities generated by new digital technologies bellantuono et al in recent years many scholars investigated the i paradigm from different perspectives however the existing literature focuses mainly on aspects technological less attention is devoted to management and organizational aspects associated with digital transformation cimini et al bordeleau felden development of a digital transformation model of geographic data to through information and communications technologies icts for example they argue that there are no frameworks or models that adequately support managers and organizations in all phases of the digital transformation process and require more structured approaches to manage the transition to the i paradigm bellantuono et al below is a presentation of the digital transformation models existing and roadmaps for the i transition consider lessons learned in the field of change management a well known approach developed to successfully manage change initiatives with this objective a review is carried out systematic review of the literature to identify dtms dtms digital transformation developed to manage the transition to the i paradigm the results are then analyzed through the lens of change management literature to do this the main change management models are reviewed and compared and identifies the set of activities to include in any transformation initiative delimiting where the greatest development in dtm is located who have been its main authors and what are the main fields of application of dtm figure development in digital transformation models dtm chapter in terms of the statistics obtained on the development in transformation models digital dtm it is observed that the area of computer science has the highest volume of knowledge generation with it is followed by the business area management and accounting with and in third place are the areas of sciences of decision and engineering with figure in the context of the digital transformation towards industry i any initiative it is considered a process of change that is a transition from a current state with certain level of digitalization towards a future state with a higher level of digitalization therefore change management is adopted as a methodological approach in the article to analyze the dtms proposed in the literature models are described and examined known change management methods in order to identify the activities that should be be included in any transformation initiative bellantuono and t al since change has become inevitable in organizational life due to development global economic and technological burnes cummings worley the organizations increasingly need change management skills the management of change refers to a structured approach to facilitate the transition from a current state of the organization to a desired future state balogun hailey it involves renewing the direction structure and capabilities of an organization to meet the needs changing needs of internal and external customers moran brightman it also refers to the process and tools used to support people in the transition creasey next the models of best known change management bellantuono et al development of a digital transformation model from geographic data to through information and communications technologies icts figure overview of change management models source taken from bellantuono et al kurt lewin s change management model figure is considered the precursor of current models according to this three step model before making changes to a organization it is necessary for members to abandon their old behaviors the steps of the model are bellantuono et al yo unfreeze members become aware of the need for change and motivates those who will be affected ii change new behaviors are introduced and changes in attitudes are developed organizational structures and processes iii refreeze the organization stabilizes in a new state of equilibrium where new behaviors are consolidated on the other hand kotter s step model of change figure is widely used the steps are bellantuono et al chapter yo establish a sense of urgency ii build a powerful guiding coalition iii create a shared vision iv communicate the vision effectively v empower others to act on the vision saw plan and create short term victories vii consolidate improvements and produce more changes viii institutionalize new approaches figure kotter s step model of change source taken from kotter ge s change acceleration process cap polk von der linn is is based on the premise that the success of a change initiative not only depends on high quality technical solutions but also to pay attention to people affected by the change the pac consists of seven steps bellantuono et al yo lead change strong and committed leadership takes charge of the initiative exchange ii create a shared need the reason for the change is clearly defined and shared with all interested parties development of a digital transformation model such from geographical data to through information and communications technologies icts iii shaping a vision a clear and legitimate vision of the future is articulated after of the change communicating it to all interested parties iv mobilize commitment a sense of commitment and involvement of all people involved in the change v make the change last implementation begins with pilot projects using the successes and knowledge acquired for other initiatives and addressing the factors that hinder change saw monitor the process progress is measured and problems are detected during the implementation vii changing systems and structures after implementation the organizational structure to ensure the permanence of the change on the other hand prosci s three phase change management process creasey prosci is based on the adkar model figure which focuses on supporting people through change the process consists of three phases bellantuono et al yo prepare for change change management plans are designed including awareness of the need for change the definition of change the formation of a change management team identification of a sponsor identifying affected groups and developing a management strategy change ii manage change communication plans are developed and implemented training sponsor roadmap training and resistance management iii reinforce change people s feedback is collected and analyzed affected the adoption of the change is measured gaps are corrected and the success chapter figure prosci three phase change management process source taken from creasey prosci in the systematic review process relevant contributions were identified that address the guiding questions among these contributions are various digital transformation models dtm proposed by different authors erol et al propose an i transformation model in three stages envision enable and enact during the envision stage we seek to develop a participatory vision of i involving stakeholders then in the enable stage converts the vision into a concrete business model and develops strategies for its implementation successful implementation finally in the enact stage the strategies are converted into real projects on the other hand schallmo et al develop a five phase roadmap for the digital transformation these phases include digital reality digital ambition potential digital adjustment and digital implementation each phase addresses different related aspects with value creation customer requirements best practices and integration with partners in the framework proposed by is sa et al for the implementation of i in manufacturing organizations several steps are established these include the formation of a working group the evaluation of digitalization the definition of approaches the use case idea generation impact estimation and case selection of use according to the level of maturity of the organization development of a digital transformation model of geographic data to through information and communications technologies icts romero et al present a lean digital transformation framework that combines lean practices and tools in five management pillars this approach includes management digital strategy which involves defining a long term digital vision evaluating the maturity digital and select appropriate technologies and work methods le grand deneckere propose an agile change management model that consists of three phases definition experimentation and anchoring in the definition phase a diagnosis in the experimentation phase workshop and control cycles are carried out and in the anchoring phase an overview of completed and future projects is provided along with an analysis of the capacity for change ng et al define a conceptual model for the systematic development of planning plans digitalization action in companies this model includes stages such as the evaluation of the current business model the design of the digital business model the evaluation of the current digital capabilities the identification of future digital capabilities and the development of the action plan rautenbach et al propose a conceptual model of digital transformation in two phases evaluation of the current value creation process and internal and external evaluation of the organization these assessments lead to the creation of job creation profiles value and digital profiles which guide the organization in creating value by taking advantage the digital dimension pessl et al propose a model to evaluate the digital maturity of companies and develop an action plan its focus is on bridging the gap between the state current and objective state of digital transformation this idea is directly related with the methodological framework proposed by leone barni who suggest supporting smes in their digital transformation by identifying innovation gaps and converting them in i integration projects its approach seeks to help companies with resources limited to achieving a successful transformation on the other hand butt proposes a framework based on the business process tradition management bpm to optimize business processes during transformation digital their focus is on redesigning processes to adapt to the digital age this idea is also related to the conceptual framework presented by van tonder et al chapter who es highlight the importance of innovation in the business model during the digital transformation both approaches seek to ensure that the processes and model business are aligned with the organization s digital objectives regarding the integration of social technologies and iot mendhurwar mishra highlight its importance in digital transformation but also point out the challenges of associated security and privacy this idea coincides with the proposal of nikitin kulchytskyy who propose a digital transformation management model based on the strategic relationship between government society companies and software developers both approaches consider the ethical and security as key elements during the digital transformation process finally ou et al present a specific decision making framework for the digital transformation in the retail industry its focus is on identifying business problems set goals and execute a transformation plan this idea highlights the importance of strategic planning and proper execution during the digital transformation process in general these theories and approaches converge on the importance of evaluating maturity digital identify gaps redesign processes innovate in the business model and consider ethical and security aspects during digital transformation i also know highlights the need for strategic planning and collaboration between different actors to achieve a successful transformation these main ideas provide a solid foundation to address the challenges and take advantage of the opportunities that arise in the context of digital transformation in companies this research was based on the partial application of the digital transformation framework for the colombian state designed by the mintic this framework is based on the compliance with article of law of national development plan the which establishes that

answered where is the greatest development located in digital transformation models and who have been their main authors and rq what are the main fields of application of transformation models digital and additionally the references or the construct for modeling the digital transformation reference framework object of this document figure figure construct for td framework design rq what are the most used ict components in the digital transformation models as has been mentioned throughout the conceptual framework the motivation to implementing digital transformation models in organizations is to facilitate the development of a digital transformation model from geographic data to through information and communications technologies icts enabling your capabilities to leverage your digital transformation through reinvention or modification of its processes products or services ensuring the value generation mintic c for this purpose icts are made available that they facilitate overcoming technological organizational and infrastructure gaps from the mintic frameworks and models of digital transformation are proposed for public and private organizations in the country regarding digital technologies they propose an ict prioritization scheme based on organizational objectives this can detailed in the following figure figure strategic priority of icts in the adoption of td models source taken from mintic c note that a large part of the icts listed in figure obey to characteristics of industry and technologies based on artificial intelligence cloud computing and the internet of things cab and note that implementation times are relative and suggested for a colombian context however this really varies depending on the type the organisation similarly the ministry of information technology and communications mintic has proposed a guide of guidelines for the acquisition and use of technologieschapter emerging in public and private entities with service provision characteristics mintic according to the mintic emerging technologies refer to new technologies that are under development or will be developed in the next five to ten years and that will substantially alter the business and social environment mintic in the current context of technological boom and the arrival of industry technologies known as emerging icts are emerging rapidly is it is important to note that emerging technologies are not necessarily new but which can also be implemented in a particular context and represent a novelty mintic the guide proposed by the mintic consists of four stages with several steps in each of them them mintic these stages are the following yo understand and create strategies to develop ict implementation strategies based on objectives of the entity b identify possible applications of icts c verify the feasibility of the implementation ii design to establish prerequisites and evaluate the current state of the entity b develop a pilot test iii enable to enable the necessary capabilities in relation to the structure organizational b establish a governance model that allows maintaining and improving the icts iv implement and sustain to implement changes at the institutional level b train and develop internal talent in the new environment of the entity in the colombian sphere the ict sector refers to the digitalization of the state and the adoption of production processes that comply with the most technological standards advanced mintic a according to the mintic this sector promotes programs and development of a digital transformation model of geographic data to through information and communications technologies icts projects that strengthen digital citizen skills and establish alliances public private that generate development for the country mintic a after the covid contingency the technology and communications sector is in a reactivation process demonstrating the importance of a digital system modern that covers the entire national territory business intelligence headquarters external intelligence coordination currently the sector focuses on three project approaches to continue with the modernization of the country intelligence headquarters of business external intelligence coordination these approaches are yo digital transformation promote the intensive use of and icts in processes productive electronic commerce msmes and their value chain with the objective of increasing productivity and competitiveness in global markets ii programmer training given the demand for specialized professionals in emerging icts it is necessary to promote training and training in programming and associated technologies to ensure a qualified workforce and competitive iii connectivity expand fiber optic coverage to connect more municipalities throughout the country thus guaranteeing adequate infrastructure that allows the access to digital services it is essential that the ict sector is informed about policies and programs of the country such as the national development plan and the initiatives of the mintic to take informed decisions that benefit companies and citizens in general mintic a government initiatives such as transformation centers digital have generated significant advances in business development and the adoption of emerging technologies mintic a furthermore it is relevant to mention success stories in the implementation of icts at the level international which include current trends in icts aligned with the industry such as cyber physical systems internet of things big data artificial intelligence among others mintic the successful implementation of these technologies has demonstrated thechapter importance of having digital transformation models that support managers in the implementation and development of dynamic capabilities mintic in the context of industry digital transformation in the manufacturing industry involves complex changes that require reformulating business models and adapting new approaches to digital transformation mintic for this six are proposed design principles for digital transformation in the manufacturing industry interoperability virtualization local talent real time talent decentralization and customer orientation mintic these principles help guide implementation successful digital transformation in this key sector of the economy although the colombian mintic itself recommends strategies for the adoption of digital transformation and the integration of emerging technologies into processes organizational there are also cases of success in the implementation of icts at the level international whose main findings are documented below according to becerra the main current trends in icts aligned with the industry are systems development the internet of things the internet of things people and services additive manufacturing d printing reverse engineering big data and analytics artificial intelligence unmanned vehicles g cybersecurity among others in the framework of digital transformation the implementation of these icts favor the digitization of industrial systems and processes as well as their interconnection through the iot big data cloud computing and cybersecurity along with others specific to the context such as wireless sensors augmented reality robotics and devices framed in smart environments becerra generally when considering td in an organization managers understand the concept and approaches but they are not always clear how to implement it here it is where td models come in to provide support to managers through methods tools and technologies that promote and facilitate transformation bordeleau felden some authors suggest that the development of dynamic capabilities could serve as the basis for a successful transformation similarly bordeleau felden suggest that both structured td methods and the development of digital and office capabilities are necessary but flexibility is required in the development of a digital transformation model of geographic data to through information and communications technologies icts approach to change management and knowledge management due to the uncertainty of the environment in industry with the advance of industry icts began to have a strong impact on the manufacturing industry digital transformation through emerging technologies was beginning to be a priority in companies producing goods the transformation it is not only digital but also social since it involves measures of change of paradigm and knowledge transfer oztemel gursev for the industry traditional manufacturing these changes are usually quite complex for which they need to reformulate business models and adapt new transformation models digital oriented to each case after a rigorous systematic literature review oztemel gursev define six design principles for td in the manufacturing industry interoperability virtualization local talent real time talent service orientation and modularity within the framework of i oztemel gursev describe some of the approaches that would facilitate digital transformation in organizations of which the following stand out cyber physical systems iot cloud computing smart factories smart cities digital manufacturing augmented reality and simulation mining data and robotics alcácer cruz machado add big data to this list the cybersecurity and additive manufacturing emphasizing the importance of cyber physical systems and the iot for smart factories as well as the internet of things services such as key technologies for organizations now td and icts always go hand in hand towards development organizational both for private entities as well as public entities literature reports various findings in the use of icts within the digital transformation framework for state government and public sector entities an example of this are the guides developed by mintic a b that seek to bring entities closer publics towards digital transformation through maturity and td models in addition gomez et al study the behavior of icts in public entities colombians identifying technological strategic and character gaps administrative that entities present when addressing emerging technologies in their entities chapter bula páez et al recommends working on better articulation of entities governments in charge of meeting the digital transformation goals since it is observed that some indicators agreed in plans programs and initiatives colombians have not reached their goal due to the lack of joint work between the parts following this thread the td with a municipal administration focus seeks to advance in technological gaps and the development of companies citizens and other groups of the city that actively participate in the td in this order of ideas cities intelligent technologies require not only icts but also digital transformation models that facilitate the adoption of these technologies it is important to study the opportunities of technology and data for each geographic productive economic and sociocultural context of the countries that is their market economy services production innovation migration resilience infrastructure interactions among others and involve the citizenship within the challenges towards the smart city hamamurad et al low the broad framework that is smart cities the most considered technologies are grouped into two groups icts that seek to guarantee connectivity to the new digital world in a way quickly and safely in a collaborative way and that involves the community accompanied of sensors that detect changes in the environment favoring traceability prevention of adversity and resilience fields also fall into this group of study such as gis trend analysis and collaborative work hamamurad et al data processing most of the data processing technologies fall into this group industry that facilitate the collection processing and analysis of data as for example iot big data and cloud computing within this field research into new technologies is also evaluated such as new materials robotics new construction methods d printing among others that promote the development of smart cities hamamurad et al smart cities also involve transportation management and tools it for solving traffic problems co in megacities currently development of a digital transformation model of geographic data to through information and communications technologies icts geographic data digital cartography and gis are some of the most used if we hope to achieve a smart city chehri et al yamamoto presents a very particular case of application of icts in the framework of geographic data science since it uses icts as an infrastructure tool digital to prevent disasters and formulate contingency strategies in japan the authors propose a gis social network mechanism which involves communication services social network the social network twitter and web gis available in japan thus creating a collaborative tool with a strong social impact and innovative content this is a example of how to relate icts with geographic data science within the framework of digital transformation for the benefit of the community to conclude this section it is highlighted that the implementation of icts has left a series of challenges in education and the step towards a digital transformation since they have changed the traditional form of learning to one based on digital becerra which requires the coordination of each role within an organization from management strategic to the operational level according to the findings found in the literature it can be seen that most of studies on the implementation of gis and geographic data in td contexts focus on improving transportation routing cartography and road infrastructure gonzález jaramillo haklay et al prah štrubelj yamamoto whose ultimate goal is to promote development towards a smart city through icts chehri et al daniel doran hamamurad et al that are supported by i technologies to guarantee digital transformation from the operational activities of each industry to government coordination and citizen participation theoretical framework this chapter aims to bring the reader closer to a conceptual approach and contextualization to the concepts and notions that will be worked on throughout the document as well as the most notable generalities in these fields to search for information in this section structured indexed and unstructured also known as gray literature which theoretically define the concepts to be treated and they provide information on the current context of these fields geographic data science in the field of science there are multiple branches of knowledge that as it is in this case they are usually intertwined to share and create new knowledge arribas bel reades point out that computer and information sciences have been intertwined with geographical sciences s which gave way to a new field that called geographic data science in which pollination could occur crusade for the benefit of both geography and the data community in general to from this new branch a whole series of conceptual approaches adapted to modern times and digitalization geographic data geographic data also known as spatial data describes the location and attributes of objects on earth they can be classified into absolute defined location by coordinates and relative location based on topological relationships the data geographic areas are commonly represented in the form of maps and are georeferenced in terrestrial coordinate systems associated with a spatial reference frame for obtain information and perform analysis adequate data processing is required which may include statistical analysis and geometric features in addition development of a digital transformation model of geographic data can be through information and communications technologies icts combine both perspectives to achieve a complete spatial analysis morea rodriguez huerta rodríguez villarreal et al madrid soto ortiz lópez geographic information systems gis geographic information systems gis are computer systems that capture they store and display data related to the location on the planet s surface these systems allow us to understand spatial relationships preserve data and perform analysis combining them with graphical and mapping interfaces gis includes both hardware as software and can use cartographic photographic digital and spreadsheets national geographic society morea rodríguez huerta rodríguez the combination of knowledge presented in geographic information system and science by longley et al and multicriteria decision analysis in geographic information science by malczewski rinner provides a comprehensive view of the application of gis in geographic data science on the one hand longley and goodchild they cover the fundamentals and general applications of gis such as capture storage and analysis of geographic data as well as the use of technologies and advanced gis techniques additionally they explore the relationship between gis and disciplines such as cartography remote sensing and spatial analysis while malczewski and rinner they focus on multi criteria decision analysis within the context of gis are combined perspectives offer a solid foundation for understanding and addressing problems complexes in spatial decision making longley et al malczewski rinner digital focus on geographic data traditionally cartographic information is presented in analog form that is representing the reality of ma physical nature and continues however with the advance technological it becomes necessary to adapt this information to digital format in a way discreetly that is analytically morea rodríguez huerta rodríguez for obtain a digital cartography it is necessary to continue with two fundamental requirements chapter digital data must be georeferenced in such a way that each data geographical location has a label that defines its spatial position in a reference the spatial characteristics of the geographic data must be described in terms digital through topological relationships additionally it is important to encode geographic data using a geocoding which according to morea rodríguez huerta rodríguez can be direct or indirect direct geocoding it consists of determining the absolute spatial location for each geographic data in a system of orthogonal coordinate axes the the most used systems are those of plane coordinates for spaces on the earth s surface in a cartesian plane with two perpendicular axes x y indirect geocoding it consists of the possibility of geographically locating elements from the values of an attribute of an entity such as the address the postal code the municipality among others this geocoding has a huge spectrum of demographic analysis on cartography and data science geographical digital transformation dt delimitation digital transformation is an evolutionary process that goes beyond the adoption of technologies affecting all aspects of an organization rodríguez abitia bribiesca correa there are different interpretations of this concept some see it as an incremental application of information technologies heilig et al a while others consider it a disruptive change driven by innovations cumulative digital data skog et al rodríguez abitia bribiesca correa digital transformation involves changes in processes organization commercial domain and society parviainen et al a it also requires multidimensional approaches such as the development of digital capabilities gurbaxani dunkle and considerations development of a digital transformation model from geographic data to through information and communications technologies icts specific to the industry and the size of the organization demlehner laumer to be successful it is important to address aspects such as organizational culture collaboration digital leadership and workforce capabilities muehlburger et al digital transformation seeks to improve organizational performance through simplification of processes the creation of new services and the innovation of products and services westerman et al in addition it can generate benefits such as improving the quality of the customer services and obtaining competitive advantages davenport fitzgerald et al rajabi bolhari sahu et al westerman bonnet in conclusion digital transformation involves profound changes in an organization and its environment and requires a clear strategic vision and the integration of digital capabilities to make the most of the opportunities of the digital age

governance and technology digitalization is not digital transformation td digitizing involves converting analog information into digital format such as scanning documents or use electronic forms reis et al a on the other hand the digitalization uses digital technology to create value in new ways improving the operational efficiency and reducing errors gobble examples of digitization can be the coordinate records in excel tables and the collection of coordinates through geospatial readers gobble hsu et al without however digitizing does not imply changes in the process itself nor does it promote new models that is part of digitalization hsu et al in short digitizing converts analog information into digital while digitalization takes advantage of technology digital to generate value digitizing involves implementing registration systems and increasingly commitment on the other hand digitalization involves taking advantage of data and processes digitized to generate knowledge and take action manyika et al the digitalization lays the foundations for digital transformation which implies a complete reconstruction of the business around the opportunities and demands it offers digital technology gobble according to jeanne ross digitalization is a necessity operational while digitization or going digital requires a value proposition visionary that has the potential to

organizations work and their organizational environment ignoring this process can pose a risk in markets highly competitive digital transformation has an impact on both aspects internal operations of an organization as well as in the creation of new opportunities commercial processes and the restructuring of roles in the value chain for example you can eliminate traditional intermediaries and give rise to new intermediaries through the direct access to consumers and the use of mobile devices parviainen et al digital transformation can be approached from three perspectives internal efficiency external opportunities and disruptive change in terms of internal efficiency the digitalization improves internal processes through digital means resulting in greater efficiency quality and

geographic data to through information and communications technologies icts technological platform considering the results of the characterization stage through partial adoption of the framework for digital transformation for public entities of the mintic it must be propose an alternative solution and depending on the type of organization it is necessary guide prioritize and detail the identified components analysis and specification of requirements it must be identified which are the spaces of work of the stakeholders and have a approximation of skills in the management of icts user needs the importance of the end user as someone who knows the rules must be understood business of the organization the type of work sessions language used between the technical group and the end user must be appropriate in order to achieve an understanding mutual ambiguities must be avoided as much as possible when identifying the need of the user by the analyst it is recommended that work records be generated with commitments results of the session date and participants the above in order to generate traceability on the identified requirements and as support to identify responsible for points of contention components that do not meet the expectations of the user constraints of existing technological ecosystems a review of existing systems must be done at the level of software components and hardware in such a way that the tool to be developed is compatible with them planning once the requirements gathering stage is completed a schedule is built to based on the estimate of resources required by each functionality according to the complexity that you have it is recommended to use a difficulty assignment according to the fibonacci scale this difficulty assignment task can be somewhat subjective since it depends on many times the skill or expertise of the developer it is advisable to rely on chapter tools such as the gantt chart to identify the project s critical path milestones and tasks that can be performed in parallel design once the characterization of the process has been carried out and the needs and appropriate technologies for the development of the tool training sessions must be held i work with the it group coordinator area leaders and the development group where work frameworks languages architectures standards protocols and work development methodologies for this research work the model developed by the mintic is adopted called technological solutions architecture guide applicable to entities public mintic as a contribution to this research within the framework of development of a model emphasis is placed on flows involving spatial data this methodology starts from the general to the specific within the regulatory framework of the open group here an architecture is defined as a structure that contains components and their interrelationships this section proposes the development of the architectures reference and solution within the framework of a digital transformation process since these they are transversal to the axes addressed data people processes and technologies the reference architecture is defined as a high level design it has no details referring to technologies or products commonly it is used as a template for development of other architectures that involve a higher level of detail his main characteristic is that it includes the design principles that govern the organization this process produces an agnostic template transparent to implementation technologies and deployment likewise presents a logical grouping at the level of service areas mintic the solution architecture represents a materialization of a solution architecture reference that is it includes specific technical components involved in the architecture as well as the interaction of these communication channels and protocols this architecture details at a technical level the components involved in the configuration of a solution represents the scenario in which these components development of a digital transformation model of geographic data to through information and communications technologies icts interact with each other respecting the guidelines and governance rules documented in the reference architecture figure overview of the enterprise architecture and its domains source taken from mintic the main advantage of developing a solution architecture is that it seeks to solve the problem of integrating a new component in a harmonious way with the assets existing technological resources of the organization additionally it must adhere to some guidelines technicians that ultimately obey the needs of the business and add value strategic to the entity having a solution architecture also addresses data components integration protocols execution environments and service areas requirements not functional high availability schemes among other aspects mintic development this stage includes the creation of repositories and the construction of the code for the needs defined in the design deployment in this instance the application must be deployed that is install and configure the software on a server or in a production environment the end userchapter performs the system test in order to verify correct operation through the use of geographic data that is part of the prioritized processes validation an acceptance test must be carried out to evaluate from the point of view of the user if the technological platform meets the requirements and expectations raised from prioritizing processes to intervene implementation of the transformation model digital geographic data once the validation test of the technological platform is completed the implementation of geo td in the group or organization for this it is necessary to carry out a communication socialization and dissemination plan to the people involved in the processes involved in td it is necessary to carry out testing and adaptation workshops of the model proposed taking into account keep in mind that the process change must be done gradually that is maintain the traditional model and the new one workshops and technical support must be carried out before during and after each field day they must be committed by functional area and evaluate the results for the prioritized processes the transition can begin with a sample of geographic data that is meaningful and making backup copies of the new data until of the data is available management of the technological tool and implementation

technological platform developed and validated in the case study group gathering of requirements in order to know first hand the expectations and requests of users of the technological platform workshops and interviews were held with the coordinator technical leaders and staff from the cartography and geological and geomorphological research group of the dgb the requirements were based mainly on the analysis of the problem documentation existing and based on the information collected from the joint sessions the functional non functional requirements and actors of the technological platform previous considerations in this case study field work is required where the resources of connectivity and computing are limited in the best of cases a smartphone or a laptop the work areas have low or no coverage of mobile data networks since the work will be carried out in rural areas of colombia areas of interest that they are usually located far from populated centers in response to this need it is validated that the technological platform will have to incorporate the mechanisms necessary to have a device that can function in offline way this device will be able to host the data on a storage unit local until they can be sent to the component that collects and centralizes all the data submitted by users there are users who prefer to record the data they take in the field in a physical book called field notebook consequently the platform must have a mechanism that incorporates a keyboard mechanism that allows for the transcription of this data quickly the applications that can be run on a laptop or workstation of either type development of a digital transformation model of geographic data to through information and communications technologies icts web or standalone are emerging as alternative solutions to the need hereby mass loading can also be carried out that is results from many stations or samples the upload forms must be friendly with help elements and that

research regarding the achievement of the proposed objectives and research questions formulated the second presents the general conclusions and the third describes the proposed points to expand the research in future work research results objectives prepare the diagnosis of the current technological state of the digital transformation of the data from the cartography and geological and geomorphological research group of the colombian geological service sgc to identify the challenges in the digitization of geographic data this objective was met through the characterization of the process through the review of literature and the partial application of the digital transformation framework for entities public of the mintic for this exercise the available tools were used to measure the digital maturity level and identify and prioritize through the heat map the processes that demand intervention in terms of digital transformation no however this was an approximation of the current technological state and had to be complemented with the evaluation and disaggregation of the processes section frames the process to performed within the model and section details the result of the objective through the geotd validation this research involved an intervention for geographical data therefore it was necessary to review in detail the key processes of the case study group through chapter work sessions with the different functional areas of the group in order to know the dynamics of processes inputs and products identify the conceptual and functional components based on icts for the digital transformation of geographic data the fulfillment of this objective is achieved through three instances the first addressed the conceptual review of icts and the exploration of previous application works documented in chapter the second instance involved the identification of the problems in the prioritized processes in the characterization and the third instance included the selection of appropriate methods and technologies to solve the problems issues it should be noted that the conceptual and functional components based on icts selected in this research are detailed in section however also they are listed in sections and to validate the model in this research the following concepts were used icts cloud computing geolocation microservices edge computing however the projects derived from this research especially for the case study can be framed in the use of machine learning and big data design the digital transformation model for geographic data the design and construction of the digital transformation model for geographic data geo td was based on the dimensions proposed by the mintic in the transformation framework digital for public entities it is a model oriented to the user and internal processes and intermediate organizations geo td seeks to enable processes that use geographic data to evolve transversally in terms of i people and digital culture ii digital data and analytics iii digital processes and iv technology providing the tools to groups and organizations to build solutions based on icts development of a digital transformation model of geographic data to through information and communications technologies icts likewise it contemplates the mintic architecture metamodel which guides the selection and definition of technological components for the design and construction of the platform the design characterization and construction of geo td is detailed in chapter validate the proposed model for the digital transformation of geographic data use case cartography and geological and geomorphological research group of the colombian geological service sgc this objective was met through the application of geo td in the cartography group and geological and geomorphological research of the colombian geological service sgc this case study was selected because it brings together potential scenarios for the model validation additionally because one belongs to the group and knows the missionality and data used in the group in addition to the objectives and in order to support the validation of the model it was developed and implemented a web oriented technological platform which works under an engine relational database with an architecture based on microservices uses http protocol to expose services to esri and google users and systems through the use of wlan lan networks and implements internet security certificates ssl in that sense this research presents the fulfillment of the stated objectives the code repository and associated documentation of the technological platform of geo td validation can be consulted in the azure link enabled for this purpose research question what methodological and conceptual elements can be incorporated into a model to enhance the digital maturity of organizations that generate and use information geographical in their missionary processes within the framework of digital transformation and considering the slr there are various instruments aimed at enhancing digital maturity at the organizational level however chapter models like geo td bring together and specify the necessary instruments and tools to enhance the digital maturity of organizations that generate and use data geographical in that sense and in the first instance the characterization and calculation tools of the level of digital maturity are a valuable instrument to diagnose the technological state current and guide ict application initiatives in the second instance the implementation of technological platforms and solutions based on ict concepts they concentrate instruments that enhance missional processes in organizations this research describes in greater detail in chapters and the instruments designed and implemented to validate the geo td model in the case study selected conclusions this research constitutes a contribution from geomatics to organizations public and private that involve geographic data in their processes and lack of elements to undertake digital transformation initiatives in different scenarios and levels geo td allows you to consult historical works without wasting effort and resources eliminates the use of email or instant messaging systems with attached files strengthens certainty in decision making and adjustments or corrections are reflected with greater immediacy geo td reduces execution time in prioritized processes since it has information in services for consultation management analysis and generation of geological and geomorphological products icts have become a fundamental element for the transformation digitalization of processes in organizations however this entails guiding efforts to increase investments in technology and highly human talent trained who can take on the challenges of digital transformation centralizing geographic data in a single system avoids duplication of records and allows better use of ict resources besides the settings or corrections are reflected with greater immediacy geo td represents an alternative solution appropriate to the needs of the case study since it eliminates neck bottles use of files development of a digital transformation model of geographic data to through information and communications technologies icts decentralized incorporates elements of geographic data quality through forms with validation in fields and eliminates the transcription of coordinates know first hand the needs of the actors including accompanying field days to understand the scenarios should be fundamental in a correct gathering of requirements for the development of a system of information that responds to the needs and expectations of the organization which which avoids resistance in its adoption digital transformation models should not focus solely on the adoption of technologies to achieve changes in their processes there must be a organizational culture that fosters encourages and adopts changes at the level technological technology must be understood as an enhancer of processes and not as a threat public servants must be allies of these initiatives and changes and not become an obstacle to its adoption digital transformation must be a state policy and not a government policy which suggests a continuity of the processes and efforts made despite the ideological and political changes that arise future work it is necessary to introduce validations from quality metrics based on standards iso that evaluate the technological platform and the quality of the gi the functionalities that provide support must be incorporated into the technological platform to processes not attended to and that have appeared in the list of processes prioritized in the heat matrix incorporate machine learning and big data capabilities on the data geographical data collected represents an interesting work challenge since the initiatives of this nature have been unsuccessful due to the non existence of a single digital data source containing all historical records of stations and samples it is important to develop your own mobile app that incorporates functions specialized in the area of cartography qr scanning for samples functions advanced methods of using a compass and adding watermarks to images annex a question

evolving the future of governments companies and society in the fourth industrial revolution ir driven by information and communication technologies ict will depend on its ability to adopt digital technologies world economic forum therefore it is necessary to transform to survive in this new environment this is what it is aimed at the digital transformation in recent years the importance of capabilities has grown digital as mechanisms in digital transformation in order to take advantage of the opportunities that the environment offers in relation to the economic political and social therefore there are studies focused on models or frameworks of digital capabilities at the level international that have been developed with the purpose of providing tools that allow us to evaluate the state in which the organizations find themselves the government of colombia has identified the importance of this transformation therefore for this reason in its global development plan it formulates the national policy of digital transformation and artificial intelligence which seeks to boost productivity and promote the well being of citizens as well as generate transversal enablers for sectoral digital transformation so that colombia can take advantage of the opportunities and address the challenges related to ir this policy is limited to be surpassed by promoting in citizens the necessary knowledge and skills to face the changes in the economic and social structures that the ir brings hence the importance of digital capabilities this policy is mandatory in public entities of the country therefore the national university of colombia un is becomes the first public institution of higher education in the country committed with digital transformation and incorporates it into its institutional strategic project for the global development plan pgd with a vision until in which aims to create a culture that transforms learning and goes hand in hand with the new introduction technologies national university of colombia to start the process of digital transformation in the university it is necessary to evaluate current capabilities as well as the obstacles or difficulties that could prevent the achievement of the transformation to as a result of this institutional policy the manizales headquarters in its action plan contemplates the project transformation of the organization which aims to know the current situation of the headquarters and one of the main themes is digital transformation this is how the present study arises due to the need for the headquarters to know the capacity current conditions to begin the digital transformation process where identifies that it is essential to integrate digital capabilities consequently this work focuses on incorporating digital capability models recognized at the level international in the digital transformation processes of the un headquarters manizales for your development a mixed methodology is followed which is the systematic integration of methods quantitative and qualitative with a non experimental methodological approach of an exploratory type which also combines descriptive aspects and what is intended is i to determine the existing best practices to evaluate digital capabilities in educational institutions higher education ii identify the level of advancement of digital capabilities at the un manizales headquarters and iii establish the lines of action of the digital transformation for the un manizales headquarters based on the current state of its digital capabilities this final work is made up of four chapters namely chapter study design the literature is reviewed where the elements are identified found by several authors in order to determine the focus of the study from this review describes the situation found the objectives sought with the study its methodology and scope in chapter digital capabilities and their main frames of reference a systematic review of literature on the models or frameworks of international digital capabilities where they were identified and analyzed six studies taking into account some criteria determined in the review of literature according to the results of the analysis it is determined that the framework of digital competence digcomp is the study that meets of the criteria analyzed therefore it is selected as the framework to follow in the analysis of the digital capabilities at the manizales headquarters chapter capacity diagnosis introduction digital at the manizales headquarters the design of the instrument is developed from the framework of digcomp competition selected in chapter likewise the research method to follow the instrument is applied to the selected population in in this case they were students teachers and administrators then the results where the report on the level of advancement of digital capabilities is written at the headquarters chapter development of the proposal based on the capacity diagnosis headquarters the aspects to improve are identified to strengthen the capabilities digital in the university community of the headquarters where a roadmap and a training plan finally the conclusions and recommendations of the study are presented which in summary the level of competence of students teachers and administrators is determined which will allow us to have a starting point for the strategies of the digital transformation project a in thirst e manizales and respond to the factors of change that are intended front facing on the other hand it can be stated that the theoretical proposal and methodology proposed by the digcomp competition framework its application is valid in institutions of higher education consequently the recommendations focus on promoting the proposed proposal in chapter and also that from this work studies can be undertaken comparative with other higher education institutions whether public or private in where not only digital capabilities are included but also the capabilities socioemotional and cognitive aspects that became more relevant with the pandemic chapter study design the future of governments companies and society in the fourth industrial revolution ir driven by information and communication technologies ict will depend of their ability to adopt digital technologies world economic forum according to klaush schwab founder of the world economic forum it is the combination of digital physical and biological systems for the transformation of humanity in the digital and intelligent era ict is increasingly recognized as a tool for facilitate socioeconomic transformation and inclusive growth world economic forum new technologies are generating innovation and creating new jobs further half of all new jobs in the united states are now in new jobs professions that did not exist a few years ago in the last decade four out of ten jobs were created in highly digital intensive sectors oecd without however this transformation presents challenges according to fierro santillán indicate that as this stage progresses the consequences in all areas of life will change they propose that in the short term there will be changes in employment proposals and that according to a study carried out by carlos toxtli entrepreneur and researcher from west virginia university of positions will be replaced by technology which will produce a progressive unemployment in this sense the ir produces transformations in relation to its speed scope and impact that it can produce in an organization in which many areas will have to change and rethink which is why it is necessary to transform to survive in this digital transformation is oriented towards this new environment duparc states that true digital transformation is achieved when the entire organization assumes the importance of a digital culture and makes it its own at all levels it is not a problem of technology but of people and organizational structures adopting a new management model arango serna branch castro benavides burgos while westerman asks the question if digital transformation is the solution to emerging business challenges in the digital age or whether it is another buzzword of marketing however or comes to the conclusion that digital transformation is the use of digital technologies to improve the performance and reach of organizations these new changes that have come with the ir industrial revolution and the transformation digital also affect higher education institutions ies so they will have the challenge of promoting learning opportunities that allow inclusion in this new digital era likewise they will have to rethink the way their processes operate internally so that it can coexist in a balanced way with technologies oriented to ict virtual reality artificial intelligence robotics systems experts augmented reality big data cloud computing the internet of things as well such as those related to emotional intelligence coaching mindfulness conscious without forgetting the organizational culture through continuous collaboration fierro santillán the importance of ict skills and digitalization in heis has been growing in in recent years there are studies focused on digital transformation models and digital capabilities with the purpose of providing tools to evaluate the state in where the institutions are located almaraz menéndez provides a framework of reference that breaks down the digital transformation process in universities and is applied at the university of salamanca likewise m kozina v kirinić carry out a measurement of digital capabilities in ies in using a model of digital capability maturity and the results of the evaluation were applied in a ies on the other hand international standards such as iste redecker and oecd recognize the need to equip all citizens with the skills necessary to use digital technologies critically and creatively bond marín dolch bedenlier zawacki richter governments including the colombian government are responding to opportunities and challenges posed by the ir with policies and strategies that address transformation digital in colombia the pace of transformation has been slow compared to the rest of the country world as evidenced by the loss of positions in international indicators such as the electronic government development index from st place in to st in and the digital competitiveness index from th in to th in therefore the government of colombia in its global development plan pact for colombia pact for equity formulates the national digital transformation and intelligence policy artificial which seeks to boost productivity and promote the well being of citizens as well as generate the transversal enablers for the sectoral digital transformation of so that colombia can take advantage of the opportunities and face the challenges related to ir the former public policy ist until now speaks of three limitations to be overcome i digital transformation policies have been more oriented to government in order to make the citizen state relationship more efficient not however although there is progress in the matter it is necessary to accelerate the step to be at the forefront of the most recent developments in the digital government field ii given the speed of technological change that is experienced the country still must encourage citizens to knowledge and digital skills necessary to face the changes in economic and social structures brought about by the ir iii the competitiveness and productivity policies have incorporated technologies digital although not with the relevance and depth that the ri national department of planning dnp p the national university of colombia un being a state entity accepts the policies proposed by the national government and considers as the main pillar within its institutional strategic project for the global development plan pgd digital transformation to create a culture that transforms learning and goes from hand in hand with new technologies national university of colombia the vision of this pillar is until the year the general objective is to promote in the university a community tuned to innovation through a digital transformation where the advancement of technology and emerging trends maximize collaboration active learning research and creation arango serna et al indicate that to begin the transformation process in the university it is necessary to evaluate the current capabilities as well as obstacles or difficulties that could prevent achievement of the transformation at the manizales headquarters before the higher university council on december the headquarters management team proposes the action plan called program to through which in one of the chapters he exposes the current situation and the diagnosis of the headquarters and include the projection of the organizational structure where they show a certain difficulty in the development of administrative processes that link several dependencies this aspect affects the organizational climate and does not allow the university be more agile and efficient national university of colombia p as an alternative solution to this condition various possibilities arise to rethink the university considering as a management principle of best practices seeking maintain a competitive advantage national university of colombia p the headquarters directives view digital transformation as an opportunity for university because it will allow you to innovate in processes under an organizational culture of change and aims as a fundamental element to establish the current state of the organization as well as the way how the people involved interact development of university work national university of colombia p according to what is established in the various studies consulted and public policy existing in colombia which mentions the limitations to be overcome in the case of this study is limitation ii which relates to promoting knowledge and skills digital citizenship national planning department dnp as well as the need for the university to know the current capabilities to begin the digital transformation process at the un and the need for the headquarters to know the status current situation in relation to digital transformation it is identified that it is essential to incorporate that digital transformation digital capabilities in this sense the following question arises how to incorporate capacity models internationally recognized in the digital transformation processes of the national university of colombia manizales campus likewise the following questions arise how to determine existing best practices for assessing capabilities digital in an hei how to identify the level of advancement of digital capabilities at un headquarters manizales how to establish the lines of action of the digital transformation for the un headquarters manizales from the current state of its digital capabilities justification according to what was stated in the situation found the directives of the manizales headquarters have raised in their action plan for the issue of digital transformation for start with the organizational change and intend as a fundamental element to establish the current state of the organization as well as the way people interact that intervene in the development of university work according to studies consulted the digital transformation and artificial intelligence policy approved by the national government it is a standard to be met by state entities coupled with the need for the un in know the current capabilities in addition to the directives of the headquarters in their intention by knowing the current state in relation to digital transformation the opportunity to incorporate existing international digital capability models in the digital transformation processes of the un headquarters manizales and from there have the tools to indicate the level of progress of the current state of the headquarters in relation to digital capabilities and generate a proposal that indicates the lines of action for the digital transformation at the manizales headquarters based on the current state of capabilities digital this project will be a tool for decision making at headquarters and a step towards compliance with the digital transformation and artificial intelligence policy proposed by the national government theoretical framework and related works the world has had to live various transformations related to industry and technology in each one changes were made in the energy sources processes and industrial activities the means of communication and transportation which has allowed great social transformations the first industrial revolution can be traced back to with the invention of the railway and the invention of the steam engine and marked the beginning of production mechanics the second industrial revolution began in the mid th century characterized by the mechanical and metallurgical industry and made mass production possible fostered by the advent of electricity and the assembly line third industrial revolution began in the s it is known as the digital revolution or the computer because it was catalyzed by personal computing s and s and the internet s schwab and the fourth industrial revolution ir begins starting in the th century characterized by the massive adoption of digital technologies such as internet smart mobile phones along with the growth of computing and storage capacity according to gonz there are three transformations derived from the combination of the technological advances first consumer behavior second the irruption of technology characterized by the exploitation of data artificial intelligence and development of new infrastructure and the third the emergence of new models of business that arise from the digital world the digital transformation has generated interest in research academia and business some authors who have been interested in the subject have their own concept such as as can be seen in table which lists various definitions of digital transformation compiled by the authors morakanyane grace o reilly table meanings of digital transformation authors definition liu et al the

o reilly when reviewing the definitions of the different authors they talk about changes with the use of the technology from different points of view these changes that have come with the ir it also affects higher education institutions ies so they will have the challenge to promote learning opportunities that allow inclusion in this new era digital fierro santillán according to the magazine iberciencia community of educators for science they indicate that as this stage progresses the consequences in all areas of life will change they propose that in the short term there will be changes in employment proposals and that according to a study carried out by carlos toxtli entrepreneur and researcher from west virginia university of positions will be replaced by technology which will produce a progressive unemployment digital transformation in education institutions superior given the importance of digital transformation in higher education institutions below is a literature review on digital transformation in higher education institutions ies in order to know the level of maturity in the which institutions are on this issue international context at the university of oldenburg in germany they carried out a study where they interviewed students and teachers in order to know the perception of the students and teachers about the use of digital media the findings indicated that both students as teachers they use a limited number of digital technology for activities related to the assimilation of learning and suggest supporting the broad use of technology for teaching and learning purposes bond et al on the other hand in a report carried out in by the digital education organization of the kingdom kingdom through which more than students from organizations were surveyed of the united kingdom and international organizations it was concluded that the full benefits of technology to support learning have not yet been realized and technology is more commonly used for convenience than for teaching more effective newman beetham in spain a study was carried out to identify the use of technology by teachers being interested both in the frequency and in the use of it as well as in the type of learning activities in which they use for which professors from universities were interviewed public ades and private sector in andalusia and the results revealed a poor integration of technologies in teaching learning processes also indicated that the change in teachers it is not produced only by putting teachers in contact with technologies and technologies alone do not change learning processes is required intense intervention in which technologies support the process of appropriation of knowledge by students through productive learning and communicative experiences marcelo yot mayor digital transformation models three important models were identified with the systematic review of literature that were developed mainly in digital transformation in educational institutions higher such models include digital capability and it capability as elements immersed in digital transformation in spain in the doctoral thesis developed by fernando enrique almaraz menéndez talks about the implications of the digital transformation process in the institutions of higher education the study was carried out mainly for the university of salamanca this research generates as a result a theoretical model for the analysis of digital transformation in universities in which they indicate levels of analysis and dimensions as visualized in

university city source prepared from almaraz menendez according to the author the model has been created specifically for the university of salamanca however can serve as a tool to test the model in other contexts in slovenia m kozina v kirinić carry out a measurement of digital capabilities in ies in using a digital capability maturity model dcmm see figure the evaluation results were collected within the institution of higher education and refer mainly to process innovations that digitize higher education and the implementation of educational technology as well as digitization of services to support teaching learning evaluation processes and the digitization of it services to support the institution s other processes the authors include eight management disciplines and an additional discipline to evaluate the digital transformation management kozina kirinić figure digital capability maturity model dcmm source prepared from kozina kirinić own translation pekka kähkipuro proposes a

transformation which indicates that the institutions have slow progress four out of institutions are resistant digital since they have the tools and make isolated use of them for they have low technological use and prefer to continue with the system traditional teaching mentions that a third party knows the benefits of blended learning bl and the transformation process integrate them repetitively without a coordinated strategy with leadership that involves all actors in the university of university institutions use the platform bl across campus they are really managing to build a mixed platform of teaching between in person and virtual learning for students just one of each heis participating in the survey are digital transformers taking greater advantage of technological tools experiment with new application models and locate as cutting edge schools idc infodoc as a conclusion of the study they indicate that it is necessary to improve the use of it infrastructure in heis review strategies in terms of execution and leadership for digital transformation projects taking into account the entire community university colombian context in colombia several studies have been carried out in order to know the maturity index of organizations regarding digital transformation one of these studies was prepared by cintel a company of innovative it projects where the first measurement was developed in and in order to identify the progress of the organizations the result shows a growth in the global maturity index of digital transformation of going from points in to points in in this study they included the educational sector and the conclusions indicated that the increase in the use of technology such as data analytics shows the need of organizations to have processed structured and organized information for decision making in the same way without ignoring the appropriation of technology by organizations as well as the management of technological change the misuse of technology and the fear of organizing it on the part of collaborators are identified as the main obstacles to the implementation of technological solutions in the organization cintel innovative it projects likewise the national association of businessmen of colombia andi developed a digital transformation survey in in which it indicates that of entrepreneurs are adopting new business models and are aware of the ir of the total businessmen expressed themselves positively with very high percentages similar between the industrial sector and the services sector on the other hand the process is much faster in service companies than in industry in according to the businessmen surveyed the main areas with greatest impact digitally transformed in the next two years are innovation in products and services the customer relations area the internal and organizational processes and the area of new business models and income streams in addition to this the main challenges faced today by companies to achieve a successful digital transformation are in their order lack of culture ignorance and budget andi the main obstacle that these surveys show in the implementation of a successful digital transformation is the organizational culture the misuse of technologies and the fear of using them of the institutions collaborators the government of colombia in its global development plan pact for colombia pact for equity formulates the national digital transformation and intelligence policy artificial which seeks to boost productivity and promote the well being of citizens as well as generate the transversal enablers for the sectoral digital transformation of so that colombia can take advantage of the opportunities and face the challenges related to the fourth industrial revolution ir national department of dnp planning the public policy existing until now has three limitations that must be overcome i digital transformation policies have been more oriented to government in order to make the citizen state relationship more efficient not however although there is progress in the matter it is necessary to accelerate the step to be at the forefront of the most recent developments in the digital government field ii given the speed of technological change that is being experienced the country must still promote knowledge and skills among citizens digital technologies necessary to face the changes in the structures economic and social that the ir brings iii competitiveness and productivity policies have incorporated the digital technologies although not with the relevance and depth required the ir the national university of colombia un accepts the policies proposed by the ministry of ict and considers it as the main pillar within its strategic project institutional for the global development plan pgd digital transformation to create a culture that transforms learning and goes hand in hand with the new technologies national university of colombia the vision of this pillar is up to the year the general objective is to foster a community attuned at the university with innovation through a digital transformation where the advancement of technology and emerging trends maximize collaboration active learning research and creation arango serna et al currently the university has an approximate model of digital transformation depicted on the parthenon monument as visualized in figure which was created as a result of different workshops carried out with the directives and areas of information technology carried out at the end of in which the expectations and needs of headquarters regarding the issue of digital transformation he proposed model for the university establishes some possible scenarios study prospective in the processes of organizational transformation and digital transformation of the university figure great parthenon digital transformation model of the national university of colombia source prepared from

objectives to determine existing best practices for assessing digital capabilities in higher education institutions b identify the level of advancement of digital capabilities at the un headquarters manizales c establish the lines of action of the digital transformation for the un headquarters manizales based on the current state of their digital capabilities scope the scope of this final master s thesis will be limited by the following aspects existing best practices for assessing digital capabilities are focused on higher education institutions the level of advancement of digital capabilities will be identified at the un manizales headquarters the lines of action for digital transformation based on digital capabilities they will be established for the un headquarters manizales methodology for the development of the final master s thesis a mixed methodology is followed which is the systematic integration of quantitative and qualitative methods in a single study with the in order to obtain a more complete photograph of the phenomenon sampieri hernández roberto collado fernández carlos likewise a methodological approach is followed experimental exploratory type according to what sampieri points out exploratory studies are carried out when the objective is to examine a topic or little studied research problem about which there are many doubts or not has been addressed before that is when the review of the literature revealed how there are only unresearched guides and ideas vaguely related to the problem of study or if we want to investigate topics and areas from new perspectives this exploratory study will also combine descriptive aspects since the studies descriptives aim to measure or collect information independently or jointly about the concepts or variables to which they refer that is their objective is not to indicate how these are related sampieri hernández roberto collado fernández carlos the methodology is integrated into three stages table methodology stage objectives activities stage objective determine the systematic review of development of existing best practices for literature on best state of the art and evaluate practical digital capabilities to evaluate theoretical framework in education institutions digital capabilities in heis superior review and categorization of the variables found best practices stage objective identify

realization of the development of the action of the proposed transformation proposal digital for un headquarters manizales based on the level of advancement of their digital capabilities chapter digital capabilities and their main frames of reference systematic review of literature on better practices to evaluate digital capabilities in heis methodology the systematic literature review rsl methodology proposed by kitchenham which consists of presenting an evaluation of a research topic through the use of a reliable rigorous and auditable methodology the process of search as can be seen in figure consists of phases planning the review development of the review and publication of results figure systematic literature review process review planning identification of the need for review development of a review protocol development of the review research identification selection of primary studies evaluation of study quality data extraction and tracking data synthesis publication of results write review report source prepared from kitchenham the adaptation of the methodology of the phases presented in figure systematic literature review process review planning at this stage the planning of the systematic review is carried out and a reference is made guide kitchenham researchers must summarize all existing information about some phenomenon in an exhaustive and impartial manner in order to establish general conclusions that individual studies or as a beginning of activities of future research identification of the need for review this identification establishes the objective of the review the questions of research and what resources are available to carry it out the objective of the review is to carry out a systematic search of literature in order to determine existing best practices for assessing digital capabilities in higher education institutions the specification of the research questions is the paradigm by which studies and classifies bibliographic material therefore what is sought to be established is what following p what is meant by digital capabilities p how to determine existing best practices for assessing capabilities digital in an hei p how many studies have been published in recent years on best practices of digital capabilities in heis q what are the existing models and methodologies to evaluate the capabilities digital in higher education institutions q which studies have been validated in institutions d e higher education development of the search protocol guz and rushchitsky and aghaei chadegani et al establish that the bases of most widespread data in the scientific field and widely used in searches for literature are scopus and web of science hence they have been selected as the bases of data to be used in the development of the systematic literature review however and given the relevance that google scholar has taken on in recent years it was decided incorporate it into the study as a complement to the search process as part of the search strategy the following search string was adopted to scopus and web of science databases digital competence or digital literacy or digital inclusion and model or methodology or strategy or evaluation or maturity model and higher education or university to carry out the search within the databases the title summary and keywords as a strategy to improve the precision of information search spante hashemi lundin algers likewise no temporal restriction and the search was restricted to articles and reviews in spanish and english the search is delimited by defining a publication interval in this case between to in order to identify what have been the most recent practices in relation with digital capabilities and corroborate what has been the current view on the issue of investigation when searching for information without any time restriction it was noticed that some terms were confused with other branches such as medicine and engineering and in a second the search for the query was carried out with the restriction of the field of life sciences computing and business development of the review research identification once the search protocol has been applied figure shows the phases of the search review of the documentation found articles are identified among the databases main data scopus web of science and google scholar publish software is used or perish and the consultation was carried out in november figure review phases source own elaboration based on scopus web of science and google scholar selection of primary studies for the manual selection of publications a first filter is made where documents they were excluded because they were duplicates that is they were in more than two bases of data the same article subsequently an initial review of the topic is carried out in general and articles are excluded because they are related to primary basic education or secondary school were in a specific area such as health or were related to specific tools such as blogs wiki etc with selected publications are included the title and summary of the article is reviewed and exclude documents they had to do with specific areas such as history science social nursing archaeology bachelor s degrees with software promotion specific or digital platforms with teaching in older adults with models specific learning objectives that are not related to the study likewise it excludes a document because it was not available items included relevant ones that were searched through google and selected from various pages of research journals on digital models and capabilities in educational institutions higher education in colombia in which the national university of colombia in total publications were evaluated for the research study quality assessment once the relevant studies have been selected based on the analysis of the title and abstract a manual assessment is carried out using tools such as mendely and excel the articles studied were classified according to the number of citations that each presents article in scopus and web of science finally we proceed to evaluate the studies trying to answer the research questions the categories were the following evaluation digital capabilities digital literacy strategy model capacity digital digital literacy digital competence framework methodology and also includes systematic review of literature in relation to definitions of competence digital data extraction and tracking as can be seen in figure it is found that the vast majority of articles were assessments of digital competence or digital literacy applied to students and teachers in heis where some specific dimensions were analyzed while strategies of articles refer to certain tactics used by some heis whether they are instruments or software to determine their digital capabilities in the review articles related to systematic literature review were detected of articles through which concepts of digital capabilities are determined digital literacy digital skills taking into account that the object of this study is to find the best practices to evaluate digital capabilities in an hei priority will be given to documents related to the competence framework categories digital model and methodology of articles that mostly mention some models in general that are used internationally figure categorization of publications percentage of publications revision strategies systematic literature model methodology frame competence digital assessment without time restriction in the selection phase figure shows that we talk about digital skills since however it began to have importance from the year lindroth bergquist and it is from of that the number of publications on best practices of digital capabilities grow with being the year that stands out figure distribution of articles in the period between and twenty one twenty fifteen eleven eleven figure indicates the countries that stand out on the topic and show a certain emphasis on the use of best practices of digital competence or digital literacy in spain united kingdom the united states and china it can be seen that colombia has entered also on the topic figure distribution of articles by country results conceptualization of digital competence and digital literacy to begin with the main foundation of this work a search is carried out for the major studies in the area and outlines the terms of competence literacy or digital skills that these concepts are often used synonymously although have different meanings martin grudziecki therefore it is necessary to give conceptual clarity of these terms digital competence is about skills essential for life they are even conceived as survival skills in the era digital eshet alkalai or vital assets in the information society a van deursen dijk ala mutka points out competence as the ability to apply knowledge and skills in different contexts such as work leisure or learning ala mutka according to deursen literacy refers to certain competencies and knowledge while skills refer to the more technical aspects of these skills and knowledge iordache mariën baelden agree with alka mutka by indicating that digital competence is discussed as the ability to apply these knowledge and skills to various contexts of life from personal to professional to do this digital literacy collects the awareness practical skills and competencies necessary to for users to access understand evaluate communicate with others and create digital content in a strategic and applied way iordache mariën baelden p according to ferrari he defines digital competence as the set of knowledge skills attitudes including abilities strategies values and awareness that are required when using the ict and digital media to carry out tasks solve problems communicate manage information to collaborate create and share content and build knowledge in an effective efficient appropriate critical creative autonomous flexible ethical and reflective for work leisure participation learning socialization consumption and empowerment p in this same sense larraz understands digital competence as the some of literacies technological or computer informational audiovisual or media and communicative to participate in a safe ethical and civic way of a digital identity in general it can be seen how the various authors perceive digital competence as a set of essential life skills and their application and digital literacy is the compilation of these skills and knowledge such as technological communicative informational audiovisual and skills are understood as something more technical than those skills and knowledge based on the review of concepts from different authors this project assumes the concept of digital competence by iordache mariën baelden and ferrari as the set of knowledge skills and attitudes that are needed when use ict and digital media and the ability to apply them in various contexts of the life from personal to professional thus after the clarification of the concepts of digital competence and digital literacy that was explained above a review and comparison of the best practices converted into models and frameworks of digital competence review and evaluation of digital competence best practices in the bibliographic review it was possible to find a series of studies related to standards frameworks and models of competencies or digital literacy eight of them with relevance at the international level and one at the national level applied to an hei to carry out the content analysis of each of the studies the following are defined selection criteria the number of references in other studies and recognized in the literature specialized they had to be relevant to the discussion of digital competence or literacy around the analysis of digital skills and competencies found included in the selected models and frameworks the studies could be applied in higher education institutions therefore for this reason some of them are focused on teaching while others are applicable to any type of institutions its structure was built as a frame with a classification of skills knowledge and competencies your publication had to cover the last years between and respectively although one of the selected frames is from due to number of citations and its relevance in the specialized literature was taken into account to have a comparison with the other selected studies based on this review it was decided to exclude three studies and select six the excluded studies were the following icdl international computer digital literacy standard icdl is an organization international which has a knowledge certification program computing this standard measures a person s ability to handle a computer drive to basic it concepts despite being an international standard is not included because its structure only includes basic knowledge of computing is not constructed as a framework which is required for analysis model for the development and accreditation of digital competence at the university virginia larraz rada it is a model created at the university of andorra its objective is to develop and accredit the competence of students it is a model little recognized by specialized literature and unclear in its content nets t standard it is a standard developed by the international society for technology in education iste standards is recognized worldwide international as a standard for teaching and focused on learning without however for the development of this work and when reviewing the other studies where three of them focus on teaching and can be implemented in other settings it was decided not to include the nets t standard in the evaluation the six studies mentioned below were selected according to to the criteria as a relevant study the unesco framework of ict competencies of teachers ict cft as a tool to guide the initial and ongoing training of teachers on the use of ict throughout the educational system it is an international framework which has had several versions and now this instrument is designed to adapt to national and institutional objectives providing an updated framework for the policy making and capacity development in this dynamic area unesco the framework is organized into three stages or successive levels of development of the teachers regarding the pedagogical use of ict acquisition of knowledge deepening of knowledge knowledge creation in turn the framework consists of competencies organized around the six aspects of the professional practice of teachers at three levels of pedagogical use of the ict by teachers the underlying idea is that teachers who have competencies to use ict in their professional practice will provide quality education and in ultimately they will be able to effectively guide the development of the competencies of the students in ict matters the six aspects of teachers professional practice are as follows understanding the role of ict in educational policies curriculum and evaluation pedagogy application of digital skills organization and administration and professional learning of teachers the iskills model developed by educational testing service ets is another of selected studies is an outcomes based framework that measures the ability to think critically in a digital environment ets is an international institution which is recognized for its ectory in the development of accreditation for both students like the citizen establishes a digital literacy framework called digital transformation a framework for ict literacy in its definition of literacy in ict identify five components that they consider essential and that represent a continuum of skills and knowledge for functioning in a society of knowledge each of the components is defined by ets as follows access know and know how to collect and or retrieve information manage apply an existing organizational or classification scheme integrate interpret and represent information it involves summarizing comparing and to contrast evaluate make judgments about the quality relevance usefulness or efficiency of the information create generate information by adapting applying designing inventing or creating information another of the selected studies developed by the european commission ipts dg eac digcomp anusca ferrari punie bre which creates the project to develop a digital competence framework that emerges from frameworks and the contribution of experts has been a reference in most studies because it is a framework applied in different contexts and is used to guide the identification of a limited set of indicators in order to measure digital competition between countries it includes competencies organized into five dimensions this framework of competition has several updates the original version was created in the by ferrari in the digcomp version is published vuorikari punie carretero van den brande in which they update their terminology the model conceptual and show some examples of its application at the european level national and regional a information and digital literacy browsing searching and filtering information evaluation of information storage and retrieval of information b online communication and collaboration interaction through technologies share information and content participate in online citizenship collaborating through digital channels netiquette identity management digital c creation of digital content content development integration and reworking copyright and licenses programming d security protection of devices protection of personal data health protection environmental protection e problem solving resolution of technical problems identification of technological needs and responses innovate and use technology in a way creative identification of digital competence gaps for the purposes of model analysis digcomp version will be used similarly the proposed digital skills measurement model is selected by v deursen van dijk in which it is stated that the digital and the social are related by similar types of fields economic cultural social and personal the authors propose a set of skills on the internet because they consider them to be a key part of digital inclusion the approach has led to search for instruments that are capable of measuring what abilities people have people how they relate to certain types of participation and how these can subsequently affect specific aspects of daily life this model was applied in holland with a sample of people and a response was obtained from people the model proposes four sets of skills to navigate the internet a operational skills to navigate the internet b formal skills to navigate the internet c internet navigation skills related to content and information d strategic skills to navigate the internet another of the selected studies was developed by kozina kirinić in slovenia in which a measurement of digital capabilities is carried out in heis in the year using a digital capability maturity model dcmm the results of the evaluation were collected within the higher education institution and were they mainly refer to process innovations that digitize education higher education and the implementation of educational technology as well as the digitalization of services to support the processes of teaching learning evaluation and digitization of it services to support the other processes of the institution business transformation management includes disciplines a strategy management b value management c risk management d program and project management e skills management and training f business process management g management of organizational change h transformational it management i metamanagement at the national level the experimental theoretical model proposed by melo solarte díaz vega serna which was carried out at the university of manizales and whose purpose was to characterize and evaluate technological competencies that the different actors who are part of an academic community have university to create the model they use the classification of competencies proposed by unesco in but they expanded the spectrum to all actors in a university community teachers students and administrative in addition focusing the analysis on the appropriation and use technological within the role that each one plays they use the five dimensions raised by unesco technological informational pedagogical communicational axiological and additionally propose a sixth dimension in productive order that determines the use of ict in the training process or in their daily activities in addition they add another dimension of productive order with which they intend to identify the importance that technologies have both in the training process of people and in their daily activities evaluation of digital competence frameworks or models to evaluate the frameworks and models a quick scan analysis is performed as it describes multiple small case studies based on a limited set of variables by mapping the variables and their indices into a single array it becomes possible to analysis of similarities differences and variances between the cases audenhove baelden mariën this is how the digital skills and competencies found are analyzed for each of the models and frameworks a matrix is created with the competencies similarities that were found in each of the studies classifying them into five categories operations for the use of ict information and knowledge digital communication creation of digital content strategic competencies in the same way each of these categories contains its criteria that in total added up twenty one which have been mapped using a matrix as can be seen observe in table for each of the studies in such a way that it could be identified the similarities or differences between them and determine which of them could be evaluated in a complete digital competencies in an hei this comparison is made through a visual analysis and review of the literature therefore it was not an analysis statistical even though there are numerical results in the matrix for the development of the matrix the cases that are the models and frameworks are mapped into columns and criteria are mapped to rows additional rows are introduced to determine the number of themes that a given case shows audenhove et al the selected categories are

understand the risks and online threats to know the security measures information and knowledge competencies the second category see table focuses on the ability to understand evaluate and have judgment regarding information in this sense the six studies evaluated coincide in the importance of having criteria for analysis and evaluation of information in such a way that a judgment can be made about the quality usefulness and effectiveness of the same information of likewise all studies agree with the information literacy criterion which consists of the ability to search identify select locate access recover store disseminate and share information these actions are those that take users when trying to satisfy information needs v deursen van dijk in relation to the criterion digital problem solving skills it is discussed by the vast majority of models and frameworks analyzed there are authors who consider the resolution of problems in their areas of competence and define it as the ability to identify digital needs and resources make informed decisions about tools most appropriate digital technologies according to the purpose or need solve conceptual problems through digital media creatively use technologies solve problems technicians update one s own and other s competence vuorikari et al according to the criterion support for others in the development of digital competence it is not indicated explicitly in the studies however three of them mention collaborative work as one of its items to evaluate in this case support groups are important to skill development the competency framework proposed by unesco being a model designed for teachers indicates that it is necessary to use digital tools flexibly to facilitate collaborative learning manage students and other parties involved in learning and manage the learning process unesco research has shown that users often rely on various support groups to develop skills and competencies outside the school environment formal education hobbs digital communication skills the third category see table is related to communication skills digital when reviewing the models and macros it is highlighted that in the vast majority there are much of the criteria such as constructing and understanding messages and interacting online some authors see the importance of communication because it distributes and manages to understand the appropriate ways to communicate through digital media to refer to different communication formats to adapt the modes and strategies of communication in a specific audience interact and collaborate online vuorikari et al likewise l participation in online networks and communities was mentioned in five studies except for kozina kirinić regarding the criterion manage an identity digital was mentioned in very few studies voorikari et al mention it as one of the criteria in relation to communication and indicates that creating adapting and managing one or more digital identities is important to be able to protect one s reputation and process data that is produced across multiple accounts and applications with respect to general behavior on the internet just like the previous criterion is mentioned by four of the studies indicate that it must be learned in practice since there is no guide formal available v deursen van dijk and they emphasize the importance of ensuring the correction of behavior and actions when interacting with other people online unesco digital content creation skills the fourth category consists of digital content creation skills see table the criteria create and edit new content build new knowledge and produce creative expressions in the vast majority of models and macros they consider it as a way to innovate generate information by adapting applying designing inventing educational testing service ets both criteria go hand in hand with integrate and mixing existing content is a relevant element in the development of digital skills and regarding the criterion knowledge and management of the rights of intellectual property ipr and licensing has been discussed in three of the studies for both respect for property rights are valued hence the users should not only know the rules about using existing work but they must also be able to understand the different types of licenses and apply them correctly to their own digital production vuorikari et al strategic competencies in the fifth category speaks of strategic competencies see table the vast majority of studies include the criterion of using the information towards personal goals or professionals some indicate that strategic competencies are management skills more advanced internet and affirm that it is necessary that they be linked to decision making decisions and notions of empowerment v deursen van dijk as for the criterion identify digital competence gaps three studies discuss this topic and melo solarte refers to the fact that every institution must have technological management that determines the viability of the acquisition of technologies besides must have appropriation strategies to reduce gaps and better achieve utilization of the investment from the previous table it can be seen in table that the models with a compliance greater than of the twenty one criteria evaluated in the five identified categories were digcomp digital

digital competence chapter capacity diagnosis digital at the manizales headquarters the objective of this stage of the study is to identify the level of progress of digital capabilities at un headquarters manizales to achieve this objective in first an instrument is designed based on the digital competence framework selected in the previous chapter in this case digcomp and later it is applicable to the university community of the manizales campus once the application has been made the data collected is tabulated and analyzed indicating the reliability of the instrument and finally the conclusions are made about the level of advancement of the capabilities digital at the un headquarters manizales instrument design in the previous chapter a systematic literature review is carried out to determine the best practices to evaluate digital capabilities in heis a review is carried out and categorization of the variables found from six models or competency frameworks digital and according to the evaluation it is concluded that the reference model to be developed for fulfilling of the competencies and variables analyzed is the framework of digital competence digcomp vuorikari et al and from this framework of competition the instrument is built the purpose of the instrument is to identify the digital capabilities of the community university of the un headquarters manizales to meet this objective the gqm goal question metric approach which is used to define adjust and evaluate a group of objectives that a project or an organization requires and that can be measured to through gqm objectives are refined into questions and metrics are defined that provide the information necessary to answer these questions basili caldiera rombach the resulting definition model consists of three levels the conceptual level goal it refers to the objectives an objective is defined to an object for a variety of reasons with respect to various quality models from various points of view in relation to a particular environment the objects of measure can be products processes or resources caldiera rombach for in the case of this study the objects will be the areas of competences defined from of the digcomp reference framework anuska ferrari the objects are summarized as follows object etive information and information literacy articulating needs information locate and recover digital data information and content judge the relevance of the sources and their content store manage and organize data digital information and content objective communication and collaboration interact communicate and collaborate through digital technologies being aware of cultural diversity and generational actively participate in society through digital services public and private and citizen participation manage identity and reputation digital objective creation of digital content create and edit digital content improve and integrate existing information and content understanding how it is copyright and licenses apply know how to give understandable instructions for computer systems objective security protect devices contents personal data and the privacy in digital environments protect physical and psychological health and know the digital technologies for well being and social inclusion know the impact environmental of digital technologies and their use objective problem solving identify needs and problems and solve conceptual problems and problematic situations in digital environments use digital tools to innovate processes and products keep updated with digital evolution at the operational level question generate a set of questions to characterize the way in which the achievements of a specific objective will be valued caldiera rombach to meet the objectives of this study the questions are constructed from of the digcomp framework table refers to five areas specific with indices from which questions are specified the frame digcomp digital competence has not developed a specific instrument therefore when performing the literature review four studies were found that developed instruments for measuring digital capabilities based on the model digcomp so the questions used to meet the objectives and the survey construction for this project were adapted by the following authors contreras germán piedrahita ospina ramírez velásquez the items evaluated from the instrument proposed by the authors present a high degree of internal consistency meeting reliability criteria cabero almenara gutiérrez castillo palacios rodríguez barroso osuna instrument validation results indicate a high degree reliability and validity gutiérrez castillo cabero almenara estrada vidal propose a instrument called digital campus which is a valid test of

each question in order to answer it quantitatively these data or metrics can be objective they depend only of the object of study that is measured and not from the point of view from which they are collected for example number of versions of the document program size or subjective they depend on the object of study that is measured and from the point of view for example user satisfaction figure indicates how the gqm approach is a hierarchical structure that begins with a objective which a series of questions is derived and each of the questions is broken down some metrics the same metric can be used to respond to different questions under the same objective basili et al figure gqm approach structure source own elaboration based on basili according to the previous structure and having as reference the areas and competencies of the digcomp competency framework vuorikari et al table shows the gqm structure used to develop the instrument the objectives are related to the areas questions

of digital technology in a creative methodology definition of the type of instrument in the research the instrument to be used in this research corresponds to the electronic survey which contains a set of standardized questions addressed to a representative sample of the population under study poe in order to know states of opinion or facts specific these have as their objective the collection of statistical information quantitative and or qualitative zikmund william g the survey aims to identify the level of advancement of digital capabilities in the un headquarters manizales the population segment that has been decided to choose within the university community of the uni national university of manizales manizales headquarters which corresponds to twelve annex instrument identification of digital capabilities in the annex a instrument identification of digital capabilities at the national university of colombia manizales headquarters p national university of colombia manizales headquarters plant administrative plant contractors undergraduate students and graduate students this way the sample size obtained from the data collected and chosen by type of stratified random sampling for research research method the research method chosen and used for this study corresponds to the model descriptive with probabilistic sampling that contains the random sampling segment stratified quantitative research will be applied in order to identify the level of advancement of digital capabilities at un headquarters manizales now from the point from an investigative point of view various authors propose that observation stimulates curiosity promotes the development of new facts that may be of scientific interest stimulates problem statement and corresponding hypothesis so observation can be used with the support of other procedures or techniques survey interview among others allowing a comparison of the results obtained by different means which are completed and allow achieving a greater precision in the information collected it is worth mentioning that descriptive research unlike research exploratory is formal and structured so the results will be considered as input information for the decision making process and final recommendations this study is carried out with a representative sample of the population to be studied and the data will be analyzed quantitatively therefore this study employs an approach quantitative which consists of the integration of the quantitative method based on the elements that make up the research firstly it uses descriptive research to systematically represent the characteristics of a situation or area of interest specific in which case the survey allows identifying the level of progress of the you have a representative sample when the main characteristics of the population under study poe are present in proportion in the sample the proportion can be extracted comparably from the number of categories of the variable or in proportion equivalent to how they are in the population under study of the different categories digital capabilities at un headquarters manizales which contribute to prove specific hypotheses and test explanations monje álvarez sample since the population size is known the following formula is used to calculate the sample size for a finite population n e n n z z p q p q

application before submitting the instrument to pilot testing there were questions according to to the gqm methodology using a likert scale with five response levels never almost never sometimes almost always always which were evaluated by a professional expert in proofreading who indicates that there were questions in several areas that meant the same thing but with different words therefore it suggests leaving only of these thus leaving questions likewise modifications are made to writing to clarify some questions additionally a question series demographics such as role teacher undergraduate student student graduate administrative contractor gender age range and level of education subsequently a pilot test is carried out with surveys applied to students a teacher and administrators with the purpose of identifying and correcting errors that may be presented in the application of the instrument time was not limited with purpose of determining how long they would take the form is used as a tool google since it allows you to add different types of questions and the link is sent through institutional email the suggestion is received to give greater clarity at the beginning of the application of the instrument in terms of time and number of questions likewise an administrator suggests giving examples in question no related to the metasearch engines no more suggestions are received from the survey in the data collection phase it is used as a tool to design the instrument the google form since it is an application that the university has and is used through institutional email and facilitates sending the message only to the community university of the headquarters likewise provides the tabulation of the data for its spreadsheet storage and graphical display of information he questionnaire is sent by institutional email randomly to the administrative staff plant and contractors staff teachers undergraduate students and postgraduate with a message indicating the objective of the study and the link to the survey annex a instrument identification of digital capabilities at the national university of colombia manizales headquarters p

graduate students faculty administrators of plant and contractors the characterization of the digital capabilities of the national university of colombia manizales headquarters considering each of the areas of competencies of the digcomp model likewise three levels of measurement of the indexes basic level a has basic knowledge and understands how to do it level intermediate b has the ability to apply or do and advanced level has the ability to propose strategies be critical and participate in practice the areas of competence are the following area of competence information and information literacy the information and information literacy competency area has three associated indexes table shows the results of each index for each of the roles table results by role indices of the information literacy area administrative contractors teaching students students plant plant graduate undergraduate level index comp f f f f f navigation a search and filtering of data b information and c digital content evaluation of a data information and digital content b c storage a and recovery of information data and b digital content c in the previous table it was identified in the first index that all roles without exception have basic knowledge regarding navigation search and filtering of data information and digital content being at a basic level however regular teachers and graduate students with a significant percentage tend to show abilities higher than the basic level and are at an intermediate level which indicates that they have the ability to locate information and digital resources in different formats in addition to expressing the needs they require in search engines and databases of specialized data for undergraduate students it is important to strengthen the data search and filtering capabilities since only are found in a upper level regarding index it can be seen in figure how all the roles are found in a intermediate level which denotes that they have the ability to compare and evaluate different sources of information data and digital content found on the internet it also shows that teachers are at a level above the basic level intermediate level and advanced level this shows that they have the capacity to evaluate information and digital content in their activities teaching ades so likewise it can be seen that administrators contractors students of undergraduate and graduate students are at a basic level this it means that they know that not all the information on the internet is reliable but they need to have the ability to compare and have judgment when evaluating information figure index evaluation of data information and digital content e ja t n and c r o q administrative of contractors staff teachers students of students of undergraduate postgraduate plant roles basic intermediate advanced figure shows how all the roles are located at an intermediate level which demonstrates the ability they have to save label files content and information in addition to knowing how to recover and manage information from the contents that have saved likewise contractors advanced and intermediate undergraduate students advanced and intermediate graduate students advanced and intermediate have a significant percentage at the advanced level this reflects that they know how to apply strategies to recover and manage the information they have saved as well as combining local storage with cloud storage to organize digital information figure index storage and recovery of information data and digital content four five undergraduate students graduate students staff teachers fifty contractors plant administrators fifteen advanced intermediate basic communication and collaboration area regarding the area of communication and collaboration it brings together six indices for evaluation see following table table results by role indices of the communication and collaboration area administrative contractors teaching students students undergraduate graduate plant level index comp f f f f f a interaction through b technologies digital c administrative contractors teaching students students undergraduate graduate plant level index comp f f f f f share a information and b contents c a participation citizenship in b line c a collaboration through b channels digital c a netiquette b c a management nar of the b digital identity c for the first index the previous table shows that both the administrative contractors teachers undergraduate students and graduate students they have the ease of interacting through digital technologies through communication tools communication such as chat instant messaging services or email being at an advanced level very few are at a basic level although figure indicates that administrators contractors teachers and students of undergraduate and graduate degrees are at an intermediate level where it is denoted that they have the ability to share files and content via emails or other digital media there is a trend in administrative teachers undergraduate and graduate students to decrease active participation at the advanced level that is sharing your knowledge content and resources to through online communities networks and collaboration platforms while contractors have a greater participation in sharing their knowledge figure information and content sharing index administrative of contractors staff teachers students of students of undergraduate postgraduate plant basic intermediate advanced when mentioning citizen participation see figure it is seen that both administrators contractors teachers undergraduate and graduate students are at a level between intermediate and advanced which reflects the ability they have to access actively to a series of specific networks and communities for different purposes furthermore those who are at an advanced level have the ability to participate and express their opinions in different virtual spaces however there is a percentage of undergraduate students graduate students teachers contractors and administrative workers who make passive or no use in terms of participation of online services and networks figure online citizen participation index undergraduate students graduate students regular teachers contractors plant administrators advanced intermediate basic regarding the collaboration index through digital channels figure shows how undergraduate students graduate students and contractors are regular users in professional development networks and have the ability to propose different digital tools and technologies for collaborative processes placing itself at an advanced level on the other hand although teachers and administrative staff make less use of professional development networks they have the ability to select routine well defined tools and technologies to collaborative processes taking into account their own needs and are located at a level intermediate however of teachers collaborate in a way basic through traditional technologies such as email when analyzing the age of teachers see figure it is identified that they are older than years this suggests that age influences the way we collaborate through digital channels figure collaboration index through digital channels administrative of contractors staff teachers students of students of undergraduate postgraduate plant basic intermediate advanced figure results by age of teachers in the collaboration index through channels digital fifty twenty basic intermediate advanced to years to years to years more than years it is highlighted that all the participating roles in the study see figure are in a higher than basic level therefore they have the skills to communicate digitally and respecting the rules of conduct are aware and respectful of diversity cultural in the field of digital communication additionally it is highlighted that the teachers have developed strategies in order to identify behaviors inadequate on the network being at an advanced level figure netiquette index administrative of contractors staff teachers students of students of undergraduate postgraduate plant basic intermediate advanced regarding the digital identity management index see figure all roles respondents know how to create their own digital identity and protect themselves according to the context and environment it is seen that it is at an intermediate level figure digital identity management index undergraduate students graduate students regular teachers contractors plant administrators advanced intermediate basic creation and digital content area regarding the area of creation and digital content three indices were evaluated mainly which are referenced in the following table table results by role creation area and digital content indexes administrative contractors teaching students students plant level postgraduate undergraduate plant comp index f f f f f development of a contents gave gitals b c integration and a reworking of contents b digital c rights of a author and licenses b c when analyzing the first index of this area it is seen how all the roles have the capacity to produce digital content in different formats such as text documents presentations multimedia image design and even multimedia in addition access through mobile devices or tablets and are located at an intermediate level see figure taking into account that this capacity facilitates the development of activities in the classroom the results show about of teachers and of undergraduate students they are at a basic level this denotes that they search create edit content digital in a simple and easy way therefore it would be important to strengthen the capabilities to give greater projection in academic activities figure digital content development index administrative of contractors staff teachers students of students of undergraduate postgraduate plant basic intermediate advanced regarding the integration and reworking of digital content it can be seen in figure which like the previous index agrees that all roles are at a level intermediate they have the ability to edit and improve content that others or themselves have produced on the other hand of undergraduate students make basic changes of content figure integration and reworking index of digital content administrative of contractors staff teachers students of students of undergraduate postgraduate plant basic intermediate advanced according to the previous results where the majority of respondents make use of digital technology for the creation of content it is observed in figure that the staff administrators contractors staff teachers students graduate students and undergraduate students know the differences between licenses and sometimes they verify the type so as not to infringe copyright by locating themselves at an intermediate level on the other hand there is a significant percentage of students from undergraduate graduate students faculty contractors and plant administrators who understand that some content may have copyright and despite this they use them without having any type of verification for this they are at a basic level figure copyright and licenses index study before undergraduate graduate students staff teachers contractors plant administrators advanced intermediate basic security area for the security area table lists the indices that were evaluated and the results by roles table results by role security area indices

previous table shows the security area in its different indices that respondents are at an intermediate or advanced level in the first index they have the ability to protect digital devices and update security strategies through the antivirus or use of passwords to reduce the risk of threats it stands out that a large part of administrators contractors teachers and undergraduate students know how to act when the device is threatened and there is a percentage of administrators and teachers who use basic antivirus in relation to the protection of personal data and digital identity see figure all roles know how to protect their online privacy and that of others using security systems protection such as passwords privileges access control and are located at a level intermediate on the other hand stands out as administrative and contractors additionally they change the default privacy of the services devices online to improve security and are at an advanced level very few found at a basic level figure personal data protection and digital identity index undergraduate students graduate students staff teachers contractors plant administrators advanced intermediate basic figure shows how all the roles are located at an intermediate and advanced level this means that they have the ability to understand the health risks associated with use of technologies taking into account the aspects ergonomics to addiction to technologies however a percentage of administrators contractors teachers graduate students and undergraduate students understand that technology can affect your health and yet no action is taken in relation to it their use is therefore at a basic level figure health and well being protection index twenty administrative of contractors staff teachers students of students of undergraduate postgraduate plant basic intermediate advanced survey participants understand the positive and negative aspects of using the technology about the environment they have a habit of closing their applications once they use the mobile device and sometimes verify that the router is out of the way of their workplace this is demonstrated in figure where all the roles were located at an intermediate advanced level however a percentage of administrators contractors teachers graduate students and undergraduate students undergraduates are at the basic level and this shows that they do not take action in relation to the use of technology on the environment figure environmental protection index fifty twenty one twenty administrative of contractors staff teachers students of students of undergraduate postgraduate plant basic intermediate advanced problem solving area in the area of problem solving three indices related to technical problems identification of needs and technological responses and innovation and use of technology creatively see following table it can be seen how in the three indices of all roles the highest percentage is at an intermediate level table results by role indices problem solving area administrative contractors teaching students students plant plant graduate undergraduate level index comp f f f f f resolution of a technical

shows the vast majority of roles are interested in seeking to solve problems non complex techniques related to common digital devices and environments with the technical information help available therefore are at the intermediate level in addition campus most notably undergraduate students graduate students and contractors who have the ability to configure and resolve a wide range of problems that arise from the use of technology to optimize its use for the learning and productivity on the other hand there is a percentage of students of undergraduate graduate students faculty contractors and administrative tasks that require support and assistance when technologies do not do they work figure technical problem resolution index basic intermediate advanced undergraduate students graduate students regular teachers contractors plant administrators in relation to the identification of needs and technological responses see figure to the same as the previous index all roles are at an intermediate level they are receptive in evaluate the different possibilities that digital environments tools and services offer to solve technological problems at a given time likewise it indicates such as some administrators contractors teachers students of graduate and undergraduate students have the ability to make decisions informed when choosing a tool or device for a task that is not are very familiar placing themselves at an advanced level figure index of identification of technological needs and responses fifty administrative of contractors staff teachers students of students of undergraduate postgraduate plant basic intermediate advanced it is also observed in figure how most of the participants are in a intermediate level this denotes that they have the ability to plan and collaborate in the search for solutions to solve problems it also stands out as a good percentage take the initiative and collaborate proactively contributing to the generation of knowledge being at an advanced level figure innovation index and use of digital technology creatively twenty administrative of contractors staff teachers students of students of undergraduate postgraduate plant basic intermediate advanced statistical analysis association analysis between demographic variables a cross section of sociodemographic variables is carried out between gender role age and level of education the chi square test and the association of variables are applied as shown shown in the following table table analysis of relationships and associations with the recoded variables in x dimension statistician no of significance association degree and relationship between chi phi and v of cases df asymptotic between direction of cram square variables er valid bilateral association variables pearson role no little or none age no little or none gender level of no little or none education role level yes weak education age yes moderate age role yes moderate df degrees of freedom it can be seen from the results obtained in table that the vectors sociodemographic age sig role sig level of education sig were associate with each other resulting in statistical significance test reliability the cronbach s alpha coefficient carried out through the spss v software for the reliability estimation under the global internal consistency method showed as indicated in table expresses in the same way the percentage of observed variance attributed to the true variance and the percentage to the variance of the measurement error table reliability statistics summary items and scale statistics reliability statistics cronbach s alpha based on no of elements standardized elements summary item statistics maximum no of mean minimum maximum range variance minimum elements stockings element variances of element scale statistics deviation mean standard variance n of elements the cronbach s alpha result obtained a scale very close to it can be concluded that the instrument in general is highly reliable furthermore it is a highly favorable to perform a factor analysis for dimension reduction of the variances of the empirical scores is due to the result of covariation between all the questions on the form the remaining is due to error variance this allows the confidence interval to be used as an excellent parameter for the statistical credibility from the results of table it can be seen if for example the element number one question number the cronbach s alpha coefficient would decrease to and there really would not be a substantial difference compared to the coefficient obtained eliminating element number question number the coefficient cronbach s alpha would increase to and there would not be a substantial difference either so therefore it is recommended to keep all elements table total statistics by element mean variance alpha total correlation correlation scale if the scale if the cronbach if the multiple element element element has element has

intervals can be estimated using the ic alpha module lara merino developed based on the method fisher the coefficient obtained was of with ci li and ls this study allows us to conclude that the ic at for li and ls therefore it is concluded that the obtained is statistically significant the interpretation of the confidence intervals is simple where a lower limit equal to or greater than would provide evidence of excellent reliability the analysis of the data internal consistency present in this study allows us to conclude that the total scale ic present upper limits of confidence intervals above what minimum required the above allows us to conclude that there is minimal measurement error in the test scores which would not affect the subsequent statistical analyzes and the conclusions of those studies that will use this scale hypothesis testing in the statistical analysis ten hypothesis tests are contemplated to contrast the five areas of the digcomp competency framework applied to the instrument the hypotheses are following first hypothesis h the information and information literacy area is not significantly related a with the communication and collaboration area h the information and information literacy area is significantly related to a the area of communication and collaboration second hypothesis h the information and information literacy area is not significantly related b with the creation and digital content area h the information and information literacy area is significantly related to b the creation and digital content area third hypothesis

decided reject the ten null hypotheses proposed concluding that with a confidence level of there is a relationship of dependence between the analyzed variables capacity advancement level report the study allowed us to investigate the level of digital skills mastery of the community university of the national university of colombia manizales campus and identify which are the most relevant aspects that lead to continuous improvement to achieve progress in levels of competence when mentioning the area of competence information and information literacy the the highest rated were the contractors followed by the teachers and students of postgraduate it is important to improve capabilities in relation to navigation search and filtering of data information and digital content since the analysis shows that in all roles the highest percentage are at a basic level however regular teachers and graduate students are at a level intermediate this shows that they have the ability to use search engines and specialized databases either for their academic work and research so likewise in relation to the evaluation of data information and digital content it stands out that teachers have a low percentage of at the basic level likewise the results showed that the highest percentage is at the intermediate level however there is a minority who are at a basic level administrative contractors graduate students and undergraduate students being an index that is located in the area of knowledge students are required to assume a criterion when evaluating and verifying the validity of information data and digital content in relation to the level of competence in the area of communication and collaboration despite that all roles are found enter at a level higher than the basic one the study presents a percentage of undergraduates graduate students teachers contractors and administrative workers who make passive or no use in the participation of online services and networks likewise there is still of teachers who they collaborate in a basic way through digital technologies such as email for example therefore skills in the use of technological tools could be strengthened for collaborative processes on the other hand it is highlighted that the university community has the skills to communicate digitally respecting standards of conduct placing themselves at an intermediate and advanced level where the best valued in this aspect it was the teachers in the area of creation and digital content the results indicate that the community university participating in the study produce digital content using different formats and are at an intermediate level however a percentage of administrative contractors teachers graduate students and undergraduate students who are at a basic level this denotes that they search create edit digital content in a simple and easy way for therefore it would be important to strengthen capabilities to give greater projection in the academic activities for teachers and students and in administrative activities for their work activities in copyright and licensing there is a percentage of undergraduate students graduate students teachers contractors and administrators of plant who understand that some content may be copyrighted and despite this they use them without having any type of verification placing themselves at a basic level it is necessary to intervene in this aspect to be clear about the importance of recognize copyright and its proper use it stands out in the area of security that the university community participating in the study has built the ability to protect their digital devices and use strategies such as the use of antivirus or passwords to reduce threats by locating in a intermediate advanced level they also protect your personal data and identity digital in this last point the university has carried out a campaign on treatment of data which has allowed us to obtain these results although the vast majority understand the health risks associated with the use of technology and take into account aspects ergonomics and their addiction there is a percentage of administrative workers contractors teachers graduate students and undergraduate students undergraduate who do not take measures regarding use regarding the problem solving area of competence as well as the previous point it is highlighted that the majority of the participants in the study show an interest in bu scar and resolve non complex technical issues related to devices and environments usual digital services plant administrators were rated better in relation to resolution of technical problems and identification of needs in responses technological on the other hand there is a lower percentage of undergraduate students graduate students teachers contractors and administrators who require support and assistance when technologies do not work and it is important improve the level so that they understand how to solve problems at a given moment according to the results in general it can be said that this study was proposed ending the year and the application of the instrument was carried out in may by therefore the manizales headquarters had been in the context of the covid pandemic for more than a year which gave it a digital boost and the activities stopped being face to face to move to a virtual environment it is thus that the university community autonomously had to learn and obtain knowledge to face digital technologies and this it is evident in the results of the study where the vast majority of the indices analyzed they were valued at an intermediate level now this qualification is only a reference and does not indicate the quality of competencies that the university community has since the instrument was designed to generally evaluate each of the areas raised by the digcomp digital competence framework therefore in order to improve the levels of digital competence at the manizales headquarters it is recommended to delve deeper into training in the five areas of competence analyzed information and information literacy communication and collaboration creation and digital content security and finally resolution of problems in order for those who are at a basic level to allow them to strengthen their capabilities and can reach an intermediate level where they can apply the knowledge and those at higher levels manage to improve their abilities digital allows them to propose strategies and participate in practice according to iorio affirms that the digital transformation scenario imposes changes that do not allow anything static whether they are companies people or societies everything must change and especially people and institutions must be open to unlearning and relearning constant chapter development of the proposal situation to transform recognizing the digital resources and capabilities that an institution has is essential to achieve its development growth and sustainability have mastery of competencies allows people to have the ability to create and exchange digital content communicate and collaborate as well as provide solutions to problems with a view to achieving effective and creative development in life work and activity social services in general unesco in addition are essential to access a range of opportunities in the st century digital capabilities must be updated periodically to respond to the introduction of new technologies and their impact on the digital economy and digital society itu academy according to the study carried out by gan andi the low qualification of workers colombians becomes a structural problem in times of economic crisis since they present a low level of adaptability to changes in the work environment on all that generated by the covid pandemic this restructuring of labor demand has increased the search for people with strengths in digital skills as well as in advanced socioemotional and cognitive skills fedesarrollo within the profiles required by companies include soft skills such as conflict resolution self learning teamwork among others which have gained greater relevance by increasing the ability to adapt to new environments labor by the workers gan andi the national university of colombia in its digital transformation process has had to adapt to changes caused by the global public health crisis with the pandemic covid in the particular case the manizales headquarters has been forced to restructure an accelerated way the development of teaching research extension as well as its administrative processes which gave a digital boost and as mentioned in the report of the previous chapter the changes that the university community to learn about the management of digital technologies were seen reflected in the results of the study where the vast majority of the analyzed indices are evaluated at an intermediate level with the digcomp model however being the pioneering university in education it is important that the university community and in especially teachers and students improve their skills to a higher level in such a way so that they not only get involved in the application intermediate level but that they can have the ability to propose be critical and participate in practices at an advanced level it should be noted that the instrument used generally evaluated the areas of digital capabilities therefore it cannot be said that the analysis has been developed in a profound way and aspects such as the capabilities advanced socioemotional and cognitive skills that have become more relevant during the pandemic the university in its digital transformation project has identified thirty five change factors which are listed in six dimensions when referring to factors of change refers to phenomena that can influence to generate changes significant in the future national university of colombia when reviewing the facts of changes it is detected that the areas of competence analyzed are directly related with these factors see table and will be a fundamental element within the process of digital transformation projected for the university likewise at the manizales headquarters the transformation program project is currently being developed organization which is carrying out a diagnosis of the current functioning of the institution in order to guide the implementation of strategies to generate a proposal prospective to the year the present study has allowed us to know the digital capabilities headquarters and will be a reference for the organization s transformation project which contemplates the beginning of the application of digital transformation at headquarters table digcomp competence areas and dimensions of

serves as input to the responsible for implementing policies derived from the digital transformation project at headquarters for the development of strategies that deepen the digital capabilities of the university community and also allows working on the factors of change detected in the digital transformation project objectives general objective strengthen the digital capabilities of the university community according to the areas competency of the digcomp competency framework specific objectives reduce the digital divide of the university community in areas of competence inform tion and information literacy guarantee the acquisition of skills in the area of communication and collaboration to teachers who are at a basic level strengthen the knowledge of the university community to guarantee its application in content creation carry out training campaigns in relation to the area of security competence to the entire university community provide support to the university community for the acquisition of competencies in the area of problem solving competence methodology it is proposed to create a roadmap that has been proposed by itu academy as a strategy to develop digital capabilities see figures and figure part getting started source own elaboration based on itu academy figure part implementation source own elaboration based on itu academy in support of this roadmap

current state in relation to the levels of competence of undergraduate students graduate students teachers administrators and contractors of the manizales headquarters and it was also possible to identify the aspects to improve this will allow have a starting point for the strategies to be developed with the project un digital transformation and respond to the intended change factors front facing likewise a training plan is proposed that indicates a roadmap to continue to strengthen the digital capabilities of the university community headquarters manizales it is concluded that the theoretical proposal and methodology proposed by the competence framework digcomp its application in higher education institutions is valid in this case a university of colombia and it is considered that the application of data collection and analysis instruments levels of measurement of results it was made based on version of the digcomp framework therefore the basic level was worked on intermediate and advanced as the result cronbach s alpha applied to the instrument obtained a very close to it can be concluded that in general it is highly reliable furthermore it is a highly favorable result to carry out a factor analysis to reduce dimension of the variance of the empirical scores is due to the result of covariation between all the questions on the form the remaining is due to the error variance this allows the confidence interval to be used as a excellent parameter for statistical credibility recommendations this research has potential since from this it can be undertaken studies in other headquarters comparative studies can be carried out with other institutions of higher education whether public or private likewise as a result of covid there is not only the need to know digital capabilities but also the capabilities socioemotional and cognitive that took on greater relevance in the pandemic it is recommended to promote the proposal raised in this study in such a way that and can stimulate and strengthen the digital capabilities of the university community of the headquarters a annex a instrument identification of the digital capabilities at the university national of colombia headquarters manizales dear student teacher administrator or contractor the purpose of this survey is to identify the digital capabilities that the university

introduction digital transformation has become a priority for educational institutions superior in this second decade of the st century given that this is a natural process and necessary for organizations that claim to be leaders of change and highly competitive in their domain furthermore today s societies face challenges and complex changes that can only be addressed and resolved only by grouping the expert knowledge and finding responsible solutions stolze et al several authors have defined digital transformation from the field of business among them hess et al who express that digital transformation is concerned with changes that digital technologies can cause in a company s business model and resulting in modified products or organizational structures or automation of processes from the vision of higher education institutions the transformation digital is the process of technological and organizational change induced in them by the development of digital technologies almaraz et al consequently the higher education institutions face a disruptive scenario that is establishes new business models transforming the way they evolve in over time actively linking internal and external clients increasing your commitment and strengthening their experience in the organization this change is called digital transformation arango serna et al on the other hand higher education institutions are also influenced and conditioned by the policies of the nation state by the global trends of the system capitalist world due to events such as the one that occurred due to the covid pandemic which are much more powerful than the changes and transformations that the institutions of higher education can produce within themselves and in the society where they reside lópez segrera according to wrana maría pazzinni cited by barcos for her transformation the university must meet global demands increase the number digital transformation in heis deployment model of quotas improve quality promote research optimize extension promote leadership provide lifelong educational services focus on learning and skills training redefining its mission and above all the dynamics of relationships and the speed of information they must have management structures and systems of information to make transparent agile and effective decisions and for a process continuous and careful evaluation capable of measuring the objectives that are achieved for its part kuzu expresses that digital transformation occurs to determine the needs and behaviors of stakeholders and provide education research and social services in accordance with the demands of users beneficiaries who take advantage of the services in a competition in an environment changing this means digitization of basic services academics students with advanced digital capabilities and decision support systems that can adapt to circumstances it is crucial that each university develops its own digital transformation strategy to achieve this goal they must evaluate the potential of digital teaching and learning offerings for their institutions and take them decisions about which ones to use based on your individual profiles budgets and specific objectives furthermore this will require partners and close cooperation with the government the business sector and civil society dräger et al however even though the concept of digital transformation has gained importance within the academic community there is still a lack of consensus on the implementation around digital transformation in educational institutions higher on which components are relevant which architectures are the most appropriate to develop digital transformation in educational institutions superior this interest has been increasing since the beginning of the pandemic as garner describes in the heis rapidly promoted processes of digital transformation then in they were forced to venture into blended learning e learning methodologies and in interest in improve and or sustain these changes over time garner at the end of the road no there is an implementation model that facilitates the understanding of the transformation digital in higher education institutions in colombia added to the above it has been possible to identify that the basis of the literature of the digital transformation in latin american universities is still limited with respect to introduction to empirical studies idc infodoc ara ngo serna et al castro benavides et al a b ramírez montoya rodriguez abitia bribiesca correa additional efforts are required to gain a better understanding of how integrate and complement the dimensions involved in transformation processes and how to improve the maturity levels of the digital transformation of institutions of higher education castro benavides et al fernández et al consequently and taking into account the knowledge gap identified the research aims to design an implementation model that explains and guide digital transformation in public higher education institutions in colombia the novelty of this work is in proposing a holistic model of digital transformation that seen as an organizational transformation relates the organizational socio cultural and technological perspectives within the institutions of higher education reflected in their level of maturity as part of this objective will explore the interrelationships between the perspectives considered and their effect on the maturity levels of digital transformation in higher education institutions this phase of the study is considered original both for the creation of the instrument of measurement of digital transformation in higher education institutions as well as for its content validation process by experts absent in the literature the research considers the quantitative study approach whose livelihood epistemological is positivism sampieri et al the models are implemented structural equations structural equation modeling sem as a multivariate data analysis technique beckett et al martínez a fierro m in sem modeling the approach will be followed referring to the method partial least squares pls sem the scope of the study focuses on all of the public universities of colombia for which a survey will be carried out by university with specific actors rectors cio heads of administrative departments directors vice rectors researchers it leaders with respect to the empirical study as it is only applied to public universities of colombia it is not possible to make statements about other educational levels or global contexts as well as the analysis of information on factors digital transformation in heis deployment model potentially influential factors such as the size of the university the date of foundation the main methodology the funds allocated to digital transformation processes the institutional quality and the educational level of digital transformation leaders this document is made up of chapters chapter describes the design of the investigation referring to the pl introduction of the research problem addresses the problematic situation literature review knowledge gap question general research subsequently in chapter the methodology of the research specifying the sem pls phases that will be carried out to achieve the proposed objectives in chapter the theoretical framework that will support the creation of the implementation model of digital transformation in healthcare institutions higher education then in chapter the description of the study design takes place empirical definition of the research hypotheses the study population dimensions variables and measures are constructed the measurement instrument is designed and validated measure of digital transformation in higher education institutions and defines the information collection protocol next there is chapter with the results of the empirical study starting with the explanation of the foundations conceptual concepts of structural equation models the results are described and analysis of the measurement and structural models and the results are discussed finally there is chapter of conclusions which presents the main results limitations of the research as well as some theoretical and practical implications he the chapter ends with future lines of research finally it includes the bibliographic references and annexes that support the research design of the investigation problematic situation organizational transformation is a topic that has been studied for some time now several decades considering it as a process through which organizations they examine what they were what they are what they will need to be and how to make changes necessary to face the future kilmann et al this is how in the environment contemporary business where organizations must be innovative flexible and faster due to uncertainty complexity and changing environment the complex and diverse nature of strategy makes the concept of fit each increasingly problematic hiekkanen et al currently and as a consequence of the fourth industrial revolution companies in almost all industries have carried out a series of initiatives to explore new digital technologies and take advantage of their benefits matt et al facing organizational transformation in a world digital as a digital transformation which to date has been analyzed from the perspectives technological digital transformation is based on the use of new digital technologies such as social networks mobile devices analytics or devices integrated organizational digital transformation requires a change in processes organizational or the creation of new business models and social the digital transformation is a phenomenon that is influencing all aspects of life human for example improving the customer experience reis et al this reality makes there different definitions and appropriations of digital transformation authors such as reis et al express that digital transformation is the use of new digital technologies that enable significant business improvements and influence all aspects of clients lives for schwab digital transformation is the result of organizational change where people processes and the business model business they understand technology as a tool to generate value among their consumers and collaborators likewise wade points out digital transformation in heis as an imperative deployment model and has led organizations to rethink how they can use technology to improve their performance or expand their businesses digital transformation is all about fundamentally with change and involves people processes strategies structures and competitive dynamics authors such as solis et al consider that the digital transformation involves realignment or new investment in technology and models commercials to more effectively engage digital customers at each point of contact in the life cycle of the customer experience companies should think in digital transformation as a formal effort to renew the vision models and commercial investments for a new digital economy for his part gobble specifies it as the profound transformation of activities processes competencies and business and organizational models to take full advantage of the changes and opportunities from a combination of digital technologies and their accelerated impact on society in a strategic and prioritized way from a general perspective as can be deduced from the definitions given by the authors digital transformation is a complex problem that affects many or all segments within a company managers must balance simultaneously the exploration and exploitation of the resources of their companies to achieving organizational agility a necessary condition for successful transformation of their businesses t hess et al in response to the problem the institutions of higher education are not immune to this imperative change as concluded by faria nóvoa saying that this transformation pre establishes that taking advantage of efficiently all the opportunities and potential offered by the large number of available digital technologies completely redefine business models in the entire value chain is not simple and of course it is a complex task this challenge is more pressing for organizations that are constantly trying to ensure their competitive position in a global market but the same worry is becoming relevant to universities as competition to select to the best students and researchers aligned with this scenario lópez segrera states that higher education institutions are influenced and conditioned by the policies of the nation state and by the global trends of the capitalist world system it seems that these influences on the university are much more powerful than the changes and transformations that can be produced by higher education institutions within themselves and in the society where they reside chapter research design p and universities compete globally for students academics and financing funds and only those that remain relevant and take advantage of the new digital capabilities will benefit in this digital era pwc as well as many companies higher education institutions have responded to the impact of digitalization through multiple separate and uncoordinated initiatives as consequently they run the risk of not considering important elements of the digital transformation or ignore solutions that are more favorable for situations specific which could have unintended adverse consequences t hess et al in addition to the above as a result of the rapid pace of technological change and the ubiquitous technologies that emerge almost daily there is no one size fits all solution everyone that supports effective digital transformation in organizations carcary et al the challenge is exacerbated by the fact that digital transformation organizational covers the entire scope of the organization and requires a rethinking completeness of skill sets and investment strategy olanrewaju et al faced with this scenario higher education institutions are called to face a digital transformation seen as an organic metamorphosis and structural that will have to be adapted over time making use of the the institution s own resources making the most of human resources and the environment that surrounds it to guarantee its survival arango serna et al systematic literature review to clarify the existing knowledge gap this section presents a review systematic literature following the prisma protocol to show that it is a complete objective and reliable description and not a partial review of a sample for convenience castro benavides et al the following section describes conducting a systematic literature review proposal digital transformation in heis deployment model objectives of the rsl the objective of this systematic review of the literature is to determine the dimensions actors and implementations that have taken place in the process of tr digital transformation within higher education institutions to this end the systematic review translates the research objective into the following main research questions rq question structure as requested in shamseer et al the questions that the review will address with reference to pico are rq how is the digital transformation reflected in higher education institutions in literature digital transformation has become relevant within organizations without however it is desirable to explore what is meant by digital transformation its scope and implications within higher education institutions this research question has been mapped into the following questions mq what definitions of digital transformation are established in the literature and do they apply to higher education institutions mq who have been the main researchers in digital transformation in higher education institutions mq how has research on digital transformation evolved in the higher education institutions over time it is required taking into account the dates the number of publications and the countries rq how has digital transformation been addressed in educational institutions superior universities have approached digital transformation from different perspectives dimensions it is required within the context to identify them highlight their characteristics relationships and contribution to the consolidation of digital transformation within the higher education institutions likewise it is important to identify who are the chapter research design main actors involved and what have been the most common errors that prevent the progress of a digitalization process this research question has been mapped into the following questions mq what are the main dimensions involved in digital transformation of higher education institutions mq how are the dimensions of the digital transformation of companies interrelated higher education institutions mq how have the actors approached the digital transformation of the institutions of higher education mq what has been the route established by higher education institutions to carry out your digital transformation methods next the methods applied in this research will be described eligibility criteria the studies will be selected according to the criteria detailed below continuation study designs studies are included where it is possible to identify which dimensions of higher education institutions have been permeated by digital transformation who has intervened in these processes their methodology the technologies adopted among others taking into account the suggestion given by kitchenham ebse using criteria pico to identify keywords and search strings defined from research questions the following is considered population p higher education institutions their actors and interested parties intervention i studies of interest to researchers on the digital transformation and its implementations components technologies etc digital transformation in heis deployment model comparison c in this study no intervention of comparison results o proposals associated with the implementation of digital transformations in higher education institutions time all studies that were published between and april will be selected for inclusion because the year is considered a starting point that recognizes the birth of the internet as one of the foundations of digital transformation configuration there will be restrictions by document type articles and minutes will be analyzed of congresses language we will include articles reported in english to avoid bias recognizing this language as the universal language sources of information the search was carried out through the electronic databases web of science and scopus since they are the most relevant scientific information platforms that access to scientific databases and the most significant publications of the different areas of knowledge in particular on digital transformation issues in higher education institutions both databases allow searching for advanced structures using operators logical ones that conform to the specifications of the systematic review proposed in this investigation as well as the filtration and bibliometric analysis tools that provide valuable information for the proposed systematic review furthermore the university national and the university of quindío have access to these available databases for their students and researchers search strategies one of the most subtle but relevant moments of an slr is the shooting strategy structured search since it must allow the filtering of the information available in the databases so that the selected articles answer the questions raised in the investigation and consequently the declared objective is met thechapter research design search strategy should allow evaluation of the completeness of the search kitchenham et al in response to this requirement the words contained in the search strategy identify the keywords considered in the pico model and also the questions of investigation o identification the structured search that was used to find the articles was digital transformation and higher education institution or universit the search string adapted to the syntax required by the institute s databases of scientific information web of science is as follows subject digital

management a set of software tools was used to manage the data and analyze the article information mendeley and microsoft excel mendeley was used to perform two tasks basically first it was to manage the articles resulting from the search in scientific databases and eliminate references duplicates second classify the information of each article underlining with a color different depending on the category on the other hand to document and manage data resulting from the following prisma protocol excel was used made it easy to follow the diagram flow once the selection process is completed the work book is composed through several tabs where each phase was documented in them all information is post to url https drive google com file d ovoqoibkzwfjmzxizonwgusmstwcl view usp shar ing and can be accessed at any time selection process o search screening inclusion exclusion criteria for the present study the following inclusion exclusion criteria of articles are taken into account found chapter research design duplicate references will be removed using the mendeley tool used for information management subsequent analysis purification and classification of articles with this tool all duplicate references were removed so the articles totals after purging were table shows the result of the search string in section we obtained a total of records after removing duplicates and summaries incorrect records were selected table number of articles without duplicates source number of articles without duplicates web os science scopus o eligibility inclusion exclusion criteria the inclusion criteria exclusion follow the conditions detailed below the title and summary of the resulting works are analyzed and the following are applied inclusion criteria articles include the sequence words digital transformation in their title and the articles include in their abstract the sequence words hei or university the criterion was applied by reading the titles and abstracts of the downloaded studies to evaluate whether the resulting works carried out research focused on the digital transformation in higher education institutions it was marked with the number if the word appeared and marked with the number if the word appeared word did not appear in cases where the title and abstract were not sufficient to make a decision the entire content of the article is evaluated to classify whether a document met these criteria the following was performed logical operation if and title abstract count if abstract abstract candidate articles no digital transformation in heis implementation model in a first review a quick reading of the title and summary of the text articles completely evaluated as eligible selected records met the described inclusion criteria and were labeled as candidate articles articles full text articles excluded with reasons n one article was excluded because there was another very similar from the same author in some cases the keywords did not exactly match those described in the inclusion exclusion criteria in this case a careful reading of the text was carried out to identify whether the authors had included synonyms or expressions that reflected the digital transformation in higher education institutions for example digitization digital business model business digital transformation digital teaching those documents were included in the following stages to continue their analysis o inclusion included quality evaluation criteria one of the tasks described as critical by kitchenham et al is the evaluation criterion of quality and is therefore considered a challenge in a systematic review furthermore an initial difficulty is that there is no agreed definition of quality of l study however the crd guidelines and the manual of the cochrane reviewers suggest that quality relates to the extent to which the study minimizes bias and maximizes internal and external validity researcher wieringa et al exposes some approaches to evaluation criteria for example is the problem clearly stated are the properties causal or clearly established problem logic is the research method sound the knowledge validation is validated in other words is the conclusion supported for the document is this a significant increase in knowledge of these situations in other words are the lessons learned interesting there is enough discussion on related work for this purpose kitchenham et al constructed a quality questionnaire based on questions that affect the quality of the study and were scored to provide a general measure of its quality in this sense the questions were adapted to the study current and the following questions are relevant to the extent that they define the inclusion exclusion of articles for complete reading and subsequent analysis that is instead from only considering dedicated solutions platforms or systems the document shouldchapter research design consider the evolutionary characteristics of digital transformation in educational institutions higher education the questions have been classified into two categories the first evaluates the study design of the article and the second the design of the system study design included are articles that demonstrate the goal and process of digital transformation that is carried out within higher education institutions of interest are interventions that address digital transformation strategies in higher education institutions are all research questions adequately answered are the main objectives of digital transformation in educational institutions indicated higher education does the article describe the methods used to address digital transformation in higher education institutions and the results of that implementation system design included are items showing dimensions model business participants and or their relationships in digital transformation processes of higher education institutions does the digital transformation proposal apply to the entire educational institution superior does the business model dimensions actors and relationships involved in the digital transformation in higher education institutions are

penetration into basically all spheres of human life and society is reflected in the concept of digital transformation digital transformation determines the transition to a massive use of digital technologies in the variety of sectors of the economy and society which improve or replace traditional products and services digital transformation of the university education system should have a broader focus and has to include the modernization of corporate it architecture management which could provide an important contribution to structuring the efforts of innovation in education kaminskyi et al fleacă the author considered the modern developments in the area of modernizing educational system with the aid of itc technology and applied process thinking principles in the attempt to capture and model interrelated activities required to integrate digital technologies in teaching learning and organizational practices fleacă stolze et al a major challenge faced by organizations today is how to adopt and leverage new digital technologies as the ability to promote digital transformation is in large part determined by a clear digital strategy enabled by a culture of change risk taking and innovation supported by its leaders the path to digitalization requires organizations to embrace a digital mindset as new digital technologies demand different mindsets and skill sets than previous waves of transformative technologies fitzgerald et al kaufman and horton kane et al bresinsky von two different but interdependent developments can be identified on the one hand innovations in digital reusner technologies drive the need for transformation and adaption in organizations but on the other hand digital innovation is also shaped by the changing demands and requirements of users implementing these innovations thus to understand the impact it is necessary to address both sides of digital transformation new technologies and tools as well as changing user requirements through digital innovations bresinsky von reusner digitized organizations need to focus on both technology domain and social domain for a successful transformation bresinsky von reusner pérez gama digital transformation seeks to significantly improve the productivity competitiveness and quality of postsecondary education institutions digital transformation is an accelerated evolution it is also revolution because of its radical and structural implications for people as for infrastructure that also requires new educational and business models grab et al grab et al syntheses that digital transformation consists of a wide range of different components ac ross such diverse disciplines like computer science social science energy management and many more at this point firms around the globe predominantly center on dealing with the latest technological advancements those include the use of artificial intelligence internet of things cloud computing or social media the multitude and complexity of different topics under the umbrella of digital transformation poses a particular challenge for firms seeking to piggy back on the latest trends on the one hand firms aim to profit from a changing market environment influenced by such mega trends on the other hand digital transformation has the power to fundamentally change entire industries and organizations thoring et al innovative digital concepts for teaching have the potential to substantially change the way courses of studies are formed because they allow for considerably more differentiation in an extreme case a student

an institution higher education discussion of the identified literature this section discusses the results associated with the key questions of research stated in section and their mapping questions how is the digital transformation reflected in higher education institutions in the literature rq digital transformation within higher education institutions has been addressed from different perspectives there were articles that provide different approaches and definitions related to digital transformation in institutions of chapter research design higher education researchers grab et al present the transformation digital as a disruptive element that fundamentally changes industries and entire organizations while researchers bresinsky von reusner they recognize that digitized organizations must focus both on the domain of technology as well as in the social domain for a successful transformation furthermore the researchers henriette et al betchoo rodrigues pérez gama g sandhu consider digital transformation in educational institutions higher education from an aligned renewal business model perspective with technological trends furthermore researcher rodrigues adds elements involved in the digital transformation process such as people processes competitive strategies structures and dynamics on the other hand researchers c sullivan staib kaminskyi et al involve a social aspect that intervenes in the digital transformation process pointing the transformation towards the life cycle of the customer experience and how digital transformation improves or replaces traditional products and services furthermore researchers j a faria nóvoa link digital transformation as a resource to create additional and differentiated value and also expand the spectrum of digital transformation in educational institutions superior to interactions across company boundaries with customers competitors and suppliers likewise kaminskyi et al introduce an organic structure the it architecture management to structure innovation efforts in education the authors fleacă and thoring et al observe the digital transformation from the educational dimension that integrates digital technologies into teaching practices learning and organization finally researchers stolze et al propose challenges in the digital transformation culture of change risk taking and innovation with the support of their leaders and training the following paragraphs give additional details on the transformation dimensions digital in higher education institutions teaching dimension digital transformation seen from the teaching dimension it has several fronts of intervention like this digital platforms and content for teaching and learning the authors bozhko et al consider that it is important to use tools that satisfy the digital transformation in heis deployment model contemporary educational standards and methods such as tools based on digital technology henriette et al in line with the authors wildan zulfikar et al who consider appropriate the nature of the platform that allows users students study at their own pace complete the curriculum without being restricted for a while one of the requirements to use these platforms is the digitization of the learning resources as well as the inclusion of introductory training courses about digital transformation from different perspectives for example hulla et a l consider the concept of teaching digitalization such as training sessions alternative and complementary theory and practice the training aims improve understanding of how digital technologies can improve training sessions practical training how digital technologies and strategies can be implemented in a company and how value is created with business models based on digitization imparting knowledge and skills for the industry and academics furthermore researchers panichkina et al express the formation of the human resources management system in the conditions of digital transformation of the economy similarly stolze et al reflect on a conceptualization of a novel educational approach in entrepreneurship for digital transformation innovation of pedagogical methodologies the authors bond et al emphasize that the innovations in digital teaching are not just technical innovations but innovations academic curricular organizational and structural furthermore blaschke hase emphasized that the use of the possibilities of digital technology can make the teaching and learning to be more flexible and lead to higher attendance student and lifelong learning skills therefore fleacă citing the communication on european higher education in the world express that the institutions higher education institutions must fulfill their function of being providers of knowledge and innovators taking advantage of new trends in digital education exploiting the potential of digital technologies developing new forms of collaboration internationally through online teaching and learning in a wide spectrum of disciplines in this regard the use of digital educational resources is perceived as a new role for teachers and students creating flexible and motivating and more autonomous fleacă additionally teachers are encouraged to integrate collaboration tools within your courses ensuring that chapter research design students have a deep understanding of the pedagogical purpose behind its use from the beginning of a course as well as training on how to use the technology peterson and how to work collaboratively with others bond et al besides researchers bresinsky von reusner introduce that approaches participatory changes the student from passive recipient of knowledge to active co creators and participants in the generation of knowledge the digital transformation takes advantage of the emergence of new pedagogical proposals he authors pérez gama advises designing and implementing intelligent models focused on students to improve their cognitive and academic productivity by for example the authors stolze et al presenting the deep dive program that combines work on a real project in the field of digital transformation with a further academic education open to both undergraduate students and motivated professionals who see the new challenge of digital transformation as a opportunity and want to educate themselves more furthermore bresinsky von reusner consider living lab as an evolution that indicates an in situ nature of research development and innovation combining a multi stakeholder approach interested parties multiple methods multiple contexts and with a clear user focus on co creation another proposal by hulla et al are the learning factories that they impart knowledge and skills for both industry and academics all of them integrate traditional theoretical learning with activation and collaboration towards a comprehensive concept stimulating maximum results of learning bresinsky von reusner literacy and digital skills in the digital economy the need arises for a new highly professional workforce with digital skills and competencies in the field of technology and communication azarenko et al the digital transformation of the training process of professional personnel consists of raising the level of abstraction in the development and use of professional skills that allow us move from technical and low level concepts to more significant and high level concepts higher bond et al additionally researchers bond et al citing pensel hofhues express that in terms of teachers perspectives universities are often said to be the driving forces for implementing and develop digital teaching and learning and for this reason it is recommended digital transformation in heis deployment model technical and pedagogical guidance the introduced teaching concept offers students participants the possibility of acquiring skills knowledge and abilities in the field of digitalization hulla et al furthermore the digital transformation in higher education institutions must be thought of from a global approach the researchers bresinsky von reusner propose developing the skills described in the digital turn hfd as a set of skills for digitization that is the secure handling of information and privacy issues complex problem solving analytical thinking collaborative work and self organized in heterogeneous teams agility interpersonal and social skills and intercultural furthermore researchers azarenko et al express that the highly professional staff should be able to interact with other people work in multicultural environments have the skills of empathy concentration and management of attention maintain information hygiene to work and manage i information on modern information environments in media in social networks in marketing and in analytical environments teaching administration process from an administrative level the authors tay low reflect that many higher education institutions have taken advantage of the use of technology to provide flexibility in learning and training just in time for students and to improve both the internal processes of availability of courses such as educational quality provisions likewise the researcher rodrigues contemplates the evolution of teaching administration from a perspective competitive where a global competition for candidates takes place changes demographics restrictions on access to financial resources new demands of the labor market and the growing expectations of students to innovate their learning teaching research and management experiences infrastructure dimension digital transformation in educational institutions top view from the infrastructure dimension has various fronts depending of the dimension it supports the following sections describe them digital infrastructure for teaching digital platforms and communication platforms learning are important tools that satisfy the standards and methods contemporary educational systems bozhko et al wildan zulfikar et al bresinsky von reusner chapter research design physical infrastructure for teaching such as laboratories for example learning factory hulla et al and living lab bresinsky von reusner data infrastructure and security the author rodrigues expresses that the use growing digital technologies and the growing connectivity of everything also entails major challenges in the level of security compliance and data protection and regulations software infrastructure an agile platform is contemplated a flexible architecture that could handle adaptive and emergent processes administrative teaching and research j a faria nóvoa tay low fleacă thoring et al stolze et al curriculum dimension this dimension has several views depending on the development process digital transformation that has been carried out curriculum modernization the modernization of curricula to meet the contemporary educational standards and methods developing curricula international finding new ways to deliver content through the digital learning and the increasing use of technologies bozhko et al fleacă bond et al first tools based on digital technology to increase the relevance of the skills training process in order to provide greater opportunities for students to acquire those skills transversal and second implement curriculum access codes outside the institution higher education kaminskyi et al finally the result of the processes of curriculum modernization should be administered by the department of curriculum management tay low flexible curriculum global requirements in the educational field have transcended boundaries of time and space this is expressed in azarenko et al the standards of the third generation vocational education institutions receive considerable degree of freedom in the implementation of a variable part of the educational program and a set of selected disciplines which allows them to adjust it opportunely taking into account takes into account the development of science technology culture economy and the sphere social because the main objective of updating the educational program is a response digital transformation in heis deployment model flexible to the needs of the labor market for example researchers stolze et to the intend to support real business projects in small groups and according to their needs through an individualized study plan flexible rather than a standard cohort curriculum and the creation of a system integrated independent evaluation of qualifications in the field of ict digital curriculum author rodrigues concluded that students demand increasingly an improvement in the basics of your experience with features such as the digitization of administrative processes unlimited hour access to all information and services using multiple platforms or a digital curriculum to raise this requirement it is necessary to digitize all study plans thoring et al pérez gama furthermore researcher g sandhu states that common learning digital education centers information centers have revolutionized teaching and learning by enabling supporting changes in pedagogy curricular and digital management dimension improve existing work and operations in in reality higher education institutions use transformation strategies digital to improve how they do their existing work apply changes to the creation of value reflect the influence of digital transformation while building new digital models in parallel or completely digitizing their current considering the new demands of the labor market and the increasing expectations of students to innovate their learning teaching research and management experiences rodrigues j a faria nóvoa in that sense these structural changes are necessary to exploit new technologies and in the back office the area managers of the different units human resources accounting financial purchasing advisory units estuary legal etc to plan assign and monitor the work to be carried out j a faria nóvoa financial and technological aspects digital transformation requires large investments therefore many challenges in digital transformation in educational institutions higher are related to financial aspects and technological limitations namely the ability to finance a digital transformation effort given the effort required to get rid of the past and adopt new and extreme technologies rodrigues j a faria nóvoa pérez gama chapter research design reorganize administrative units the changes caused by a transformation digital in higher education institutions are not only limited to infrastructure technological but they extend to the levels of the organizational structure of the institution depending on the digital transformation process that will be carried out within of higher education institutions the responsible department must assume its commitment which is consistent with their capabilities and abilities therefore the authors j a faria nóvoa azarenko et al thoring et al reconsider that higher education institutions and their administrative units become a requirement furthermore they decide the most efficient way to provide the service to eliminate most bureaucratic processes and parallel tasks additional ones that fatigue rather than provide relief for this approach to be successful universities must restructure their delivery model academic and administrative governance beginning with a change of mentality away from administrative thinking towards an entrepreneurial mentality and redesigning the administrative and business academic model of the institution through the recognition of opportunities demonstrating the ability to act quickly and precision agilely developing new concepts and allowing an infrastructure flexible and supportive stolze et al pérez gama informed decision making digital transformation within units administrative functions will allow staff members to manage processes in their hands record the dates of tasks archive the documents produced and exchange messages with other parties interested in the processes furthermore the reports of activity and service level indicators integrated with the mechanisms of business intelligence provides a comprehensive view of business processes in course and a critical vision for effective decision making j a faria nóvoa research dimension the research dimension has also been impregnated by digital transformation research is forced to align with the digital transformation to meet the requirements and expectations of actors involved in the processes research projects rodrigues first the authors bresinsky von reusner thoring et al hulla et al have shown interest in achieving the integration of research processes with the processes of digital transformation in heis deployment model teaching learning secondly the author pérez gama considers that the research must merge with innovation to generate intellectual assets digital finally professor wildan zulfikar et al contemplates that one of the drivers of change in higher education institutions is the integration of industry where students are exposed to more practical learning processes based on the industry and on the other hand the existence of research associations human resources dimension there is a relationship between digital transformation in higher education institutions and human resources on the one hand the transformation digital influences and impacts human resources factors and contributes to improving the productivity betchoo on the other hand the digital capabilities of the resources humans are the key facilitator of university digital transformation through competent digital workforce g sandhu in that sense the dimension of human resources has different approaches first authors bresinsky von reusner clair sullivan staib grab et al reflect that the domains where these organizations are innovating quickly and comprehensively are the virtual collaboration and data analysis this means avoiding old forms of leadership hierarchical and lead leadership towards more agile ways of working leadership not only to explore evaluate and plan the implementation of new technologies but also to take into account the impact of these innovations on the members of the organization secondly the researcher betchoo expresses that there must be a effective coordination between the implementation and use of digital technologies to reap the benefits in human resource development talent and management performance thirdly the authors tay low azarenko et al consider the need to train new staff in the use of quality assessment independent competition and in the establishment of integration links between superiors finally the authors betchoo azarenko et al hulla et al pérez gama consider the importance of digital transformation within of public organizations and their impact on human resources factors related such as human resource development talent and performance management intellectual and creative abilities staff creativity and competences for future workforce as digital talent equipped with digital experience such to promote implement and maintain the system towards the iv industrial revolution chapter research design extension dimension another dimension permeated by the digital transformation in higher education institutions is the extension dimension the authors clair sullivan staib azarenko et al panichkina et al consider defining the use of independent certification of competence and the establishment of links of integration between universities specialized secondary schools large companies and public administration in the region furthermore the opportunity to improve the adaptation mechanisms of graduates in the labor market through interaction of educational organizations and companies where the qualification of workers in terms of turning them into digital appendages reducing the proportion of workers with average skills who are easier to replace by digital technologies furthermore pérez gama considers that one of the pillars of the digital transformation model is the social projection of the institution both at the internal and external for the transfer of knowledge and technologies that promote the productivity and competitiveness of the country governance dimension of digital transformation an important challenge that organizations face today is how to adopt and take advantage of the new digital technologies since the ability to promote digital transformation is largely determined by a clear digital strategy enabled by a culture of change risk taking and innovation supported by their leaders stolze et al in consequently the governance dimension of digital transformation exists in higher education institutions because for a highly digitalized organization it is crucial to understand and manage the change management of digital innovations such as an important factor in successful implementation bresinsky von reusner clair sullivan staib likewise the analysis of the needs of the institution education must be aligned and within the scope of the governance strategy and the higher education management model taking into account the different scenarios normative and non normative as well as the theory of corporate governance must correspond to the theoretical organizational and strategic aspects of the assignment resource innovator fleacă j a faria nóvoa azarenko et al pérez gama furthermore this implies taking into account risk management to minimize the impact of these innovations on organizational members bresinsky von reusner grab et al digital transformation in heis deployment model information dimension the information dimension in digital transformation in higher education institutions it is a very valuable asset bear therefore must be aligned and consistent with the business architecture of educational institutions superior first to enrich the internal formulation and implementation process strategically data from multiple sources can be simplified so that business planning business more agile and effective also with the help of data analysis and big data can be translated into commercial value while companies can still benefit more of an open information policy that allows ideas to travel freely to the within an organization thoring et al grab et al in this sense the digital transformation requires a data architecture and its public data model with exchange opportunities between universities j a faria nóvoa kaminskyi et al additionally it introduces managers and resource professionals humans as key actors to guarantee the effective management of the transformation of data in business betchoo secondly from the perspective of teaching in modern conditions educational materials are already created in formats digital and become the key facilitator of online education g sandhu marketing dimension the marketing dimension is integrated into the transformation digital in higher education institutions as a new facet of educational institutions higher education that requires a digital marketing model to enter the networks social and other digital media that open education options in the markets emerging increase the appropriation of academic talent and the emergence of brands global universities wildan zulfikar et al pérez gama besides benefit from the existing and secure platforms frequented by many users while offering a broader range of products and services grab et al business process dimension in the context of the business process the digital transformation forces companies to develop change and adapt to the different stages of digital evolution in other words it promotes the reinvention of institution the transition from related operating procedures to the use of digital technologies to improve improve or replace traditional services with digital to simplify the processes involved in the provision of services educational and operational complexity tay low j a faria nóvoa chapter research design kaminskyi et al clair sullivan staib wildan zulfikar et al bond et al thoring et al grab et al pérez gama from the student s perspective they increasingly demand an improvement in the basics of their experience as users with features such as the digitalization of processes administrative unlimited hour access to all information and to the cycle apas of student life in the business process system from admission to university until graduation and services using multiple platforms or resume digital rodrigues kaminskyi et al what an architecture infers institutional with a vision that integrates all efforts in productivity and quality towards the objective of the competitiveness model which consolidates the digital transformation pérez gama how has the digital transformation been directed in educational institutions superior rq digital transformation guidelines in higher education institutions from a vision macro organizational digital transformation requires a well rounded digital strategy planned that includes the digital transformation framework in which all key actors and interested parties can play an active role in shaping the university to thrive in the digital age g sandhu in this sense the main challenges of the digital transformation of a higher education institution it is the definition of a strategic vision for digital transformation the institutions of higher education need a strategic vision that allows the entire institution join in the implementation of digital initiatives a clear vision will make the team and stakeholders become more involved and invested in the transformation process digital for a digital strategy to be successful it is necessary to ensure that the higher education institutions have the necessary resources for their implementation rodrigues assuming that the general objective of digital transformations in the information system higher education is the transformation of educational services and processes of accompanying business there are three different possible directions that need to be analyzed transformation and redefinition of educational services to match the changes to the university s business process system transformation of digital transformation in heis deployment model business processes aimed at creating new and improving business processes existing it based systems as the basis for further analysis and transformation of educational services combining the first and second directions to integrate the simultaneous transformation in both directions kaminskyi et al in the aspect of the transformation of products and services the following stages are distinguished improvement add additional services expansion add new product features or existing services through digital components and redefinition creating new products or services that replace the previous ones in terms of the processes of business the stages are as follows creation the emergence of new business processes business on the basis of it leverage the emergence of new there are opportunities for achieve greater efficiency of business processes and integration the combination of new and traditional business processes in a single infrastructure in what refers to a synthesis of the key digital transformation guidelines the authors faria nóvoa describe the main pillars of a digital transformation develop new services based on digital improve user experience reengineering of processes strengthen technological infrastructures promoting their agility and adaptability and develop a decision making support system to analyze the current and future university the author wildan zulfikar et al considered canvas taking into account digital transformation from a process focused vision educational teaching learning the authors consider the following researchers hulla et al citing levy murnane say that the fourth industrial revolution propagates the idea that personnel focus on activities innovative creative and communicative likewise citing gehrke kühn rule indicate that workers will have to perform more complex and indirect tasks such as work with robots and collaborating machines additionally they must deal with the information generated in real time as well as a greater amount of data and communicate with machines therefore teaching and learning environments would have to be consistent with these requirements and the emergence of common learning areas centers of digital education digital learning centers information areas that have revolutionized teaching and learning the topic of digital pedagogy is presented such as the use of electronic elements to improve or change the experience of the education g sandhu while others recognize the entrepreneurial mentalitychapter research design as a driver of digital transformation therefore they consider the first step in the co creation process to conduct a discussion among the leaders of higher education institutions and the center for entrepreneurship and a series of relevant stakeholders e g faculty faculty deans and industry partners and technological through individual meetings and a broader workshop to formulate the requirements and guidelines for future training in the field of entrepreneurship and digitization stolze et al regarding the perspectives of university teachers it is often said that they are the driving forces for implementing and developing digital teaching and learning and for this reason technical and pedagogical guidance is recommended bozhko et al depending on the teaching learning methodology and the results of the learning strategies will be developed researchers hulla et al they mention the instit innovation projects as a very important infrastructure resource important where training laboratories based on studies of cases similarly the authors bozhko et al suggest a guide that consists of several laboratory tasks containing theoretical information a calculation task a practical task a laboratory guide and a self test questionnaire providing the connection between different disciplines finally professor fleacă delves into the process based model to design digital practices of teaching and learning the process based model begins with the variables of necessary input such as educational organization data and offers capabilities digital teaching and learning to the organization in the attempt to define and integrate digital learning technologies in organizational practices another approach is the living labs concept that allows cooperation in all stages of a development process development ideation conceptualization testing prototyping validation development exploitation and marketing in a participatory approach to the network of real world context bridging the gap between exploration and exploitation and knowledge and solutions bresinsky von reusner as mentioned above from a teaching perspective digital transformation of higher education institutions requires the creation of learning guides but also the learning resources that must be developed to meet the requirements established by the guidelines the authors tay low digital transformation in heis deployment model describe that the process of developing learning resources in institutions higher education involves planning and coordination among multiple groups functions of the academic faculty and administrative officials these include internal departments as well as external stakeholders publishers and suppliers external parties involved in the creation and delivery services of course materials to higher education institutions digital transformation center authors kaminskyi et al specify as part of the implementation of digital transformation in higher education institutions that the university business process system requires the creation of a directory administrative services for the training and internal research process personnel management infrastructure management and other support services of the same likewise the authors j a faria nóvoa detailed how a service center was created shared at the center of the digital business strategy for digital transformation in a higher education institution with the aim of improving the quality of the services provided to the academy and reducing overall costs from the point d in view of teaching the authors thoring et al consider in instead of a centralization of information knowledge and experience in the field of digital education teachers want a digitization center at that they can contact for information and practical advice on services existing computer systems advice on digital teaching concepts and support in the implementation of new digitalization ideas according to g sandhu the centers libraries have offered services such as platform development and support technological learning management systems digital assessment tools diagnostic tools plagiarism software etc support instructional design development of a new type of learning spaces digital enrichment to support problem based collaborative competency based learning and also establishment of research data management service these centers support pedagogically through quality and well designed technological spaces that include interactive computing multimedia creation large scale visualization in visualization studio d scan printing reengineering process to be successful digital transformation in healthcare institutions higher education requires a profound reengineering of all support processes chapter research design a task that must be treated with deep sensitivity and attention to overcome the natural resistance to change of the different headquarters within the institutions of higher education the company taking into account that the digital transformation promotes the reinvention of the pérez gama institution and due to the size of the university and the hundreds of processes managed daily reengineering and certification of all processes and the dematerialization of document management while maintaining the agility of technological infrastructures is a very demanding process requiring an innovative approach to be successful compilation and execution system it is required to develop a system that has the agility to evolve harmonize and consolidate procedures as they emerge naturally j a faria nóvoa competence center authors such as thoring et al and bozhko et al consider the center of teaching and learning as support to the members of the faculty at the university information and practical support including introductory courses for teaching and learning as well as a range of courses for the development professional related to university teaching taking into account that the university education requires the development of a strategy for transformation digital and the formation of new information and communication skills is required develop digital capabilities who are the key enabler of digital transformation university through the competent digital workforce kaminskyi et al enterprise architecture it architecture management digitalization the architecture business and business architecture constitute a conceptual tool that helps organizations understand their own structure and the approach with which they work pérez gama the author fleacă citing dag h kjersti indicates that other scholars who have studied the challenges induced by implementation of enterprise it architecture in educational institutions higher level evidenced key benefits of integrating it systems with educational processes in terms of greater agility of the educational organization better decision making and lower it related risks the digital transformation of higher education institutions must go through a process called digitalization which is converting existing physical assets into their digital transformation in heis deployment model digital form wildan zulfikar et al this process permeates all scenarios within it from the mission and strategic processes to the support processes by for this reason higher education institutions must start looking at digital comprehensively and to transform themselves by applying digital thinking in everything they do how internal processes operate and how they obtain their main mission rodrigues change management a shift towards digital first mindset puts all staff at the forefront of innovation and business reinvention in the digital age g sandhu this change from technological diffusion to digital transformation must have a effect on human resources betchoo in other words efforts are made on the part of the staff to maintain quality and safety against digital disruption and more research is required to better understand the process clair sullivan staib if digital transformation positively impacts resources humans is likely to promote visible changes in performance production service quality talent development among others betchoo this is how change management must be considered in all stages of the implementation of a digital transformation before during and after understand the total picture with proper governance and analysis of the entire system is essential to accurately evaluate the digital cycle clair sullivan and staib in general a digital strategy depends largely on several factors some technological and others of a non technological nature rodrigues some reasons for the fact that companies do not push to address digitalization processes is evident given the challenging nature of exercise or since the standardization of internal processes can require a lot of time and resources grab et al among these factors are the culture and internal organization organizational silos organizational resistance to change the lack of resources and budget the legal and regulatory implications the understanding customer behavior or impact lack of data to justify the value of digital transformation lack of skills and digital literacy and the security rodrigues chapter research design knowledge gap in response to the demands of the fourth industrial revolution the institutions of higher education have been forced to transform to coexist in a world digital however this digital transformation not only implies technological progress it is more transcendental and generates changes so significant that they affect the culture and dynamics university in all its contexts from pedagogical approaches teaching and learning to administrative processes research extension infrastructure budget among others in this context digital transformation in educational institutions higher education requires rethinking restructuring reinventing the institutions of higher education from its multipurpose multiprocess multidisciplinary nature multi state and multi user it is a collective effort that puts the person at the center of the process of development transformation and its impact on society from the systematic literature review the prevalence of case studies is evident conceptual and illustrative as a clear indication of the lack of maturity of this phenomenon therefore future research should focus more on establishing the theoretical foundations of the field based on existing theories or developing others new ones reis et al which allow higher education institutions address digital transformation opportunities and challenges objective system general objective explain the influence relationships between digital transformation practices and implementation of digital transformation in public universities in colombia by designing an implementation model specific objectives ob identify the different dimensions involved in the processes of digital transformation that have been carried out in the public universities of colombia digital transformation in heis deployment model ob propose an implementation model that relates the dimensions identified in ob and the digital transformation in public universities of colombia ob develop and apply a measurement instrument to evaluate the execution of digital transformation practices and the implementation of digital transformation in public universities of colombia ob adjust the digital transformation implementation model for public universities of colombia ob validate the digital transformation implementation model for public universities of colombia investigation methodology the proposal is designed considering a quantitative study approach of the investigation whose epistemological support is positivism a paradigm that has as its the objective is to verify hypotheses using statistical techniques or determine the different parameters of a variable through numerical expressions sampieri et al according to the author amador rodríguez adúriz bravo the guidelines positivists consider that science is a body of knowledge made up of facts and theories that are considered true in the sense of being contrasted with the data observational and whose verification is carried out through the empiricist scientific method primacy of observation according to sampieri et al the quantitative approach is sequential and evidentiary the order it s rigorous part of an idea that is limited and once delimited are derived objectives and research questions the literature is reviewed and a framework or a theoretical perspective hypotheses are established from the questions and variables are determined a plan is drawn up to test them design variables are measured in a certain context the measurements obtained are analyzed using statistical methods and the a series of conclusions this phase is developed under the quantitative correlational approach the investigation quantitative aims to determine how various concepts are related or linked variables or characteristics among themselves or also if they are not related sampieri et al structural equation models will be implemented structural equation modeling sem which is a data analysis technique second generation multivariate combines aspects of factor analysis and regression multiplex that allows simultaneously examining a series of interrelationships of dependence and interdependence between observable variables and latent variables as well as between latent variables beckett et al martínez a fierro m digital transformation in heis deployment model in sem modeling the approach will be followed referring to the least squares method pls sem based on the analysis of variance which implies a more flexible modeling methodology by not requiring parametric assumptions rigorous mainly in the distribution of the data pls sem emerged as a technique to analyze the complex relationships between latent variables that allow explain the observed data and being a technique under a causal predictive approach of sem emphasizes prediction in the estimation of statistical models whose structures are designed to provide explanations causal this method is also useful for confirmatory research joseph f hair et al additionally pls sem has greater statistical power meaning that pls sem is more likely to identify relationships as meaningful when in fact they are present in the population joseph f hair et al pls sem is now widely applied in many social science disciplines including organizational management educational sciences behavioral sciences international management human resources management information management systems operations management marketing management strategic management hotel management and supply chain management as well as the publication of several textbooks edited volumes and special issues of academic journals cepeda carrión roldán salgueiro martínez ávila fierro moreno joseph f hair et al this statistical technique for series of estimates of simultaneous equations using multiple regressions are characterized by two basic components the structural model and the measurement model the structural model is the guiding model that shows the dependency relationships between independent variables exogenous and variables dependent endogenous the measurement model shows the relationships between the constructs latent variables and indicators observable variables in this model the contribution of each item reactive to the measurement scale is evaluated that is specifies which indicators define each construct furthermore it evaluates the reliability of constructs and indicators martínez a fierro m below are the steps to be carried out in the research see figure chapter research methodology figure outline of the research methodology development of measurement scales indicators data collection instrument information expert assessment based on the literature review the constructs their characteristics and the relationships between them the proposed digital transformation implementation model for universities then to measure the theoretical constructs the scale is considered likert an information collection instrument will be created which represents the proposed model a survey will be developed as it is the most useful tool suitable for obtaining specific information finally there will be reviews of the instrument by experts to evaluate its validity content applying the delphi method delimitation of the population the defined unit of analysis is the universities public of colombia according to the men there are public universities in colombia the functional area that is mainly related to the processes of digital transformation are the systems technologies innovation or research systems engineering careers and related in this sense they are the leaders or heads of these areas or departments those responsible and knowledgeable digital transformation in heis deployment model of the dynamics of digital transformation that has been carried out within the universities a survey will be applied per university to specific actors cio it leaders heads of administrative departments managers for other on the other hand pls sem can certainly be used with small samples but the the nature of the population determines the situations in which population sizes small samples are acceptable hair et al thus the size of the recommended sample in pls sem is for a statistical power of with a significance level of a minimum r of and a number of two of arrows pointing to the construct application of information collection instruments the survey will be applied to actors in a self administered manner using software existing to guarantee internal validity the same instrument will be administered to all actors likewise to validate the external validity the instrument will be applied in colombian public universities analysis and processing of information before submitting the data to analysis multivariate statistical analysis a descriptive analysis of the data will be carried out likewise due data processing will be done for subsequent quantitative analysis statistical analysis of the information and reporting of results it is considered to use the multivariate statistical analysis technique using the smartpls tool to validate the measurement model and contrast the structural model using the pls sem technique the data will be analyzed following the procedure suggested by hair et al first the measurement model is evaluated to establish the reliability convergent validity and discriminant validity of the scales used subsequently the fit of the structural model is evaluated and whether or not they support the research hypotheses specifically for the development of point hair et al established the methodology that consists of the following stages to apply pls sem see figure chapter research methodology figure stages for analysis and validation of the model applying pls sem stage specification of the structural model the structural model also called internal model in the context of pls sem represents the constructs or latent variables circles or ovals the structural model also shows the relationships paths between the constructs latent variables can be exogenous those constructs that explain other constructs in the model or endogenous those constructs that are explained by the model trajectory models are developed based on theory hair et al in addition to observing the latent and observable variables it is also it is important to mention two aspects that may be immersed in the model and they are the mediation and moderation martínez a fierro m mediation involves a situation where one or more mediating variables explain the processes through the which an exogenous construct influences an endogenous one noreña on the other hand the moderation occurs when the effect of an exogenous latent variable on a variable endogenous latent variable depends on the values that a third variable called variable moderator which moderates the relationship noreña digital transformation in heis deployment model stage development and specification of the measurement model the measurement model of the constructs also called external models in pls sem show the relationships between the constructs and their observable variables or indicators rectangles in general there are two different ways to measure unobservable variables one approach is known as a reflective model and the other is a formative model in a training model the arrows go from the indicators to the construct indicating a causal relationship predictive in that direction while a reflective model the arrows go from the construct towards the indicators indicating the assumption that the construct causes the measurement more precisely co variation of the indicator variables stage design a study to generate empirical results in this stage it develops the collection and examination of data the appropriate sample size is evaluated and select the missing data estimation and approximation model to run this stage researchers will take into account general rules such as those provided by cohen in his statistical power analyzes for multiple regression models provided that the measurement models have acceptable quality in terms of loads external i e loadings must be above the common threshold of thus the things the recommended sample size in pls sem is for a power statistic of with a significance level of a minimum r of and a number two of arrows pointing to the construct stage evaluation of the measurement and structural model the stage involves efforts to test the validity and reliability of the model and its corresponding theoretical relationships hypothetical validity is evaluated that is whether what is desired is being measured measure and reliability which is a measure of the degree to which a set of performance indicators a latent variable is internally coherent depending on the high interrelationship of the indicators among themselves the individual reliability of the item internal consistency or reliability of a scale convergent validity and discriminant validity in the evaluation of the global model estimation of the measurement model goodness criteria are not established adjustment covariance based sem but and evaluate the measures separately reflective and formative martínez a fierro m see table chapter research methodology table evaluation of pls sem

coefficients effect sizes f effect sizes q prior to evaluating the measurement model it should be considered if necessary the treatment of second order constructs hcm from its acronym in english hierarchical component models a second order construct occurs when a latent variable it is measured by several first order latent variables in that case researchers should apply a combination of the indicators approach repeated and the use of latent variable scores in a two phase hcm analysis in the first phase the model is estimated with the indicators of the first order factors adding all the previous indicators as indicators of the factor construct of second order this method is called hcm hierarchical component method cepeda carrión roldán salgueiro hair et al in a second phase of pls analysis the model is estimated using the scores calculated by the program to each of the first order constructs rather than the data the scores of the first order constructs are the average loadings of the items of each component weighted with the loads estimated in the first stage cepeda carrión roldán salgueiro joseph f hair et al see figure digital transformation in heis deployment model

construct vl to second order construct vl stage a evaluation of reflective measures internal consistency or scale reliability according to beckett et al the construct reliability aims to test the internal consistency of all indicators by measure the concept that is the rigor with which the variables manifest they are measuring the latent variable the reliability coefficient measure which evaluates the consistency of the entire scale is cronbach s alpha the lower limit generally agreed for cronbach s alpha e s additionally cronbach s alpha is only applicable to latent variables with reflective indicators cepeda carrión roldán salgueiro convergent validity it is a measure that indicates that a set of indicators items or reagents represent a single underlying construct martínez a fierro m is that is it evaluates the degree to which two measures of the same concept are correlated here the researcher can look for alternative measures of a concept and then correlate them with the summed scale the high correlations here indicate that the scale you are measuring your intended concept beckett et al convergent validity is calculated with the ave which measures that the variance of the construct can be explained through chapter research methodology of its indicators martínez a fierro m the ave must be greater than or equal to and provides the amount of variance that a construct obtains from its indicators in relationship to the amount of variance due to measurement error this means that each construct or variable explains at least of the variance of the indicators individual item reliability reliability measures the degree to which the measurements are free of random errors this reliability examines the simple loadings or correlations of the indicators such as the construct they aim to measure the load value must be equal to or greater than since they indicate that the construct explains more than of the variance of the indicator which provides acceptable reliability of the items hair et al discriminant validity discriminant validity refers to the extent to which a construct is empirically distinct from other constructs within the structural model f hair et al the empirical test is again the correlation between the measurements but this time the summed scale correlates with a similar measure but conceptually different now the correlation should be low showing that the scale is sufficiently different from the other concept beckett et al in summary convergent validity confirms that the scale is correlated with other known measures of the concept while discriminant validity ensures that the scale is sufficiently different from other concepts to be distinct beckett et al additionally prior to validating the structural model it is necessary to study the validity and reliability of the second order constructs that will act as indicators in the structural model stage b evaluation of formative measures convergent validity is the degree to which the formatively measured construct is positively correlated with a measure alternative reflective or single item of the same construct noreña the collinearity between indicators which arises when two variables are highly correlated and the significance and relevance of the weights which are the result of a multiple regression of a construct with its indicators the weights are the main criterion to assess the relative importance of each indicator in the formative measurement models noreña digital transformation in heis deployment model stage evaluation of the structural model once the measurement model has been analyzed requires evaluating the structural model the final stage involves efforts to test the validity of the structural model and its corresponding hypothetical theoretical relationships the structural evaluation of the model analyzes the r the predictive relevance q the size and the significance of the standardized regression coefficients or path coefficients and the effect sizes f and q the interpretation of results and the support or not of the hypothesis the basic pls algorithm follows a two step approach the first concerns the iterative estimation of the latent variable scores and the second step is refers to the final estimation of the weights loads and path coefficients through the estimation of ordinary least squares multiple and simple and in the analysis of main components martínez a fierro m stage advanced analysis once the structural model latent variables and observable it is also important to mention two aspects that may be involved in the model and they are mediation and moderation martínez ávila fierro moreno the core of mediation analysis is that it assumes a sequence of relationships in which that an independent variable affects a mediating variable which then affects a dependent variable see figure nitzl et al mediation and moderation are similar in that they describe situations in which the relationship between two constructs depends on a third variable mediation happens when a third mediating variable intervenes between two other constructs related more precisely a change in the exogenous variable causes a change in the mediating variable which in turn results in a change in the endogenous variable in the pls path model therefore a mediating variable governs nature i e that is the underlying mechanism or process of the relationship between two constructs hair et al for its part moderation describes a situation in which the relationship between two constructs is not constant but depends on the values of a third variable called moderator variable the moderating variable or construct changes the strength or even the direction of a relationship between two constructs in the model hair et al the approach separately evaluates direct indirect and total effects chapter research methodology figure general mediation model nitzl et al in addition to the analysis of mediating variables the results obtained can be expanded report the estimated path coefficients of the standard pls sem adding a dimension to the analysis more specifically the analysis of the importance performance map importance performance map analysis ipma that compares the total effects of the model structure on a specific dependent construct target with the mean of the scores of the latent antecedent variables of said construct hair et al noreña as a result conclusions can be drawn about two dimensions i e both importance and performance which is particularly significant to prioritize the management actions that should be taken consequently it is preferable focus primarily on improving the performance of those constructs that show a great importance in terms of its explanation of a certain objective construct but at the same time they have relatively low performance hair et al stage interpretation of results once the monitoring results are obtained of the previous stages the stage of analysis and interpretation of results begins to which decisions will be based on the theory described in hair et al theoretical framework this section aims to contextualize the digital transformation in educational institutions higher education as an organizational transformation where they must be taken into account account and align different perspectives to synchronize digital transformation in one holistic and evolutionary integration over time this evolution may be the result of a gradual change in the behavior of individual elements in the company or can be the result of a deliberate and conscious action which aims to carry out changes in a company harmsen et al with the fourth industrial revolution as says schwab the transformation in its scale scope and complexity will be different unlike anything humanity has experienced before it is characterized by a fusion of technologies that are blurring the lines between the physical digital and biological spheres the response must be comprehensive involving all policy stakeholders global from the public and private sectors to academia and civil society in consequently the pressure on companies to align their business strategy with the technological changes in the environment have increased significantly with the emergence and growing importance of new digital technologies the strategic context of organizations is being profoundly transformed changing the structure of competition behavior and expectations of customers the way business is conducted the way products are made products and services are provided the way of working and ultimately the nature of entire industries teichert from the educational field the university has known how to adapt freely to the successive orders is socioeconomic to radical changes in science and intellectual culture if not so it has long been would have gone down in history this scenario has allowed the university to continue to be a powerful and omnipresent institution a tribute that is due not so much to its transcendent virtue as if to its incessant adaptation scott adaptation required to face great challenges a variety of academic levels that proliferate digital transformation in heis deployment model rapidly and a growing political controversy over the cost and financing of the postsecondary offering the long standing monopoly of universities on production official knowledge now has new competitors whether from think tanks social networks or technology firms that attract top academics with data of great capacity and generous compensations the transnational competition for prominence of students and research has only increased in recent years driven in part by a global hegemony of rankings as metrics of prestige such dynamism requires and rewards a coherent sociology of universities as organizations eaton stevens the objective of a digital transformation is continuous optimization in such a way it can detect changes in the market and respond quickly gobble to orchestrate these profound changes a transformation is required within the universities synchronized as a paradigm shift for leadership in education change occurs as a natural manifestation of the developmental sequence in the maturity transformation process at the execution level there is the company operational related to normal operations a first order system while that at the level of transformation is the business transformation company a second order system harmsen et al next digital transformation will be explained as a transformation process organizational and its perspectives for change will be described digital transformation as transformation organizational according to kilmann et al cited by calderón hernández et al the transformation is a process by which organizations examine what they were what they are what they will need to be and how to make the necessary changes for them the transformation is characterized by being a non linear process that requires great effort of the organization as a whole and not a simple approximation of its parts in addition to achieve this it is necessary to understand that organizational transformations focus in human cultural social processes encourages collaboration between leaders of the organization and members in conjunction with technological and structural elements calderón hernández et al pérez vallejo et al on the other hand not allchapter theoretical framework organizational changes are in the same order of magnitude according to bartunek moch organizational transformation is the work of facilitating change in organizations sugarman since the s and s these changes have received names like first order single loop alpha shift or second order double loop gamma shift thus authors such as amir uri cited by pérez vallejo et al introduced organizational change as a strategic and lasting process in the time the first order change occurs incrementally and is defined as those minor improvements and adjustments that do not change the core of the system and are developed naturally within its established paradigm and the second order change is in the core of the organization and is irreversible the change has occurred in the very essence in the kernel and nothing special needs to be done to maintain the change that has been made reached in contrast to first order change second order change has a wider reach and is more durable it is deeper and involves changes in the thought not only in behavior amir uri bartunek moch furthermore it is a multi layered process that simultaneously affects different levels of organizations and even to the context of the organization s operation ferlie et al such change is often required when organizations change their basic mission enter completely new markets or when facing a crisis by failing to meet competitive challenges sugarman the importance of external pressures and the role of crisis in initiating change in large organizations illustrating the cocktail of internal and external pressures that produces strategic organizational change the transformation process implies that the system would go beyond present forms since emergent forms rarely are clear it is impossible to specify the exact nature of the transformational change except to suggest that it generally tends to produce systems with a higher level of structure that can encompass and manage the expanded system greater simplicity general that increases the efficiency of the operation higher levels of consciousness self reflective allowing the system to see its own functioning more clearly and therefore allows for a more harmonious orchestration between all components of the system elgin bushnell in this sense it is the incorporation of changes important organizational aspects in the strategic management processes of the organization digital transformation in heis deployment model which led to greater emphasis on a macro or holistic view of organizational change ferlie et al in other words the second order change is a change multidimensional radical organizational multini vel qualitative discontinuous that involves a paradigm shift amir uri it is significant to highlight that organizational transformation is defined as the work of facilitate fundamental change in organizations and promote paradigmatic change sugarman when the organization s belief system no longer explains the in reality nor does it help shape policies and operations the organization goes through a crisis in this situation dominant coalitions tend to adhere to the old paradigm to increase centralization and to call for going back to basics these actions they deepen the crisis until a turning point is reached in that case the organization either stops functioning or suddenly jumps to a higher order and a new paradigm with a new vision of the world a new organizational philosophy beliefs values structure policies and operations amir uri as adams points out organizational transformation means a change in both thought and action as a more fundamental level that has been achieved so far by most of the change s agents the author k lewin cited by pérez vallejo et al describes organizational transformation as a modification of the forces that maintain the behavior of a stable system so said behavior is a product of two types of forces those that help change to take place driving forces and those who resist the change from occurring restrictive forces who want maintain the status quo they also propose the change in three phases the first of them is the thaw the motivation for change is created or its need is evident movement can occur through the assimilation of new information the exposure of new concepts or the development of a different perspective and refreezing or stabilization of change calderón hernández et al later schein added that to the unfreezing stage three sub processes discussion of the expectations induction of the desire for learning which occurs once the the validity and relevance of the facts initially discussed and provision of security psychological which converts anxiety into motivation for change calderón hernández et al finally change occurs through cognitive restructuring in the which words are redefined concepts are interpreted more broadly or they learn new standards of evaluation and judgment calderón hernández et al chapter theoretical framework on the other hand the authors amir uri propose evolutionary change by distinguishing five general stages stage planned organizational change and development changes in the environment and in the organization adaptation efforts by development step by step changes step into the current belief system purpose and mission stage c awareness incremental and minor changes cannot provide satisfactory solutions there is a call to go back to basics and to stick to the old muddle through crisis stage creating readiness for change facilitating the new new things emerge ideas in the periphery and they spread or new leadership suggests a new vision and direction difficulties for informal legitimation stage creating energy for change creating an open space the new ideas are subject to campaigns and political conflicts the efforts for formal legitimation result in a sudden change and acceptance of the new order paradigm stage facilitate the transition new ideas are translated into norms regulations procedures and structures development of the mechanism socialization digital transformation in institutions higher education digital transformation is the deep and accelerated transformation of the activities of the business processes competencies and models to make the most of the changes and opportunities provided by digital technologies and their impact on society in a strategic and priority way demirkan et al additionally it is defined as a complex organizational transformation that aligns in a holistic harmonious and strategic approach agile and flexible processes people information supported by current and emerging technologies castro benavides et al so likewise the author teichert defines digital transformation as a process of change disruptive or incremental it begins with the adoption and use of digital technologies then digital transformation in heis deployment model evolves towards an implicit holistic transformation of an organization by becoming in a paradigm of change the digital transformation underlined by the fourth revolution industrial is surrounding the universities and pressuring them in turn to transform in order to comply with new social requirements therefore only change in the organizational paradigm can generate high performance furthermore each paradigm shift needs to be anticipated by a change in the strategies and methods to facilitate the next level of paradigm shift like in the kuhn s theory of scientific revolutions paradigms or organizational frameworks they nest inside each other each new paradigm is an extension of the old one providing a broader frame of reference in which both coexist amir uri digital transformation generates changes in vision and meaning impacting culture immersed in the university the administrative and training activities its evaluations pedagogical approaches teaching research extension and administration as well as the people immersed in it it s not just about what universities invest in technology it s about how they use this investment and how new leadership makes a digital transformation successful the transformation digital not only attempts to measure the extent to which an organization is able to benefit of the use of technologies but is also seen as an evolutionary process through which technologies become a fundamental element of their daily lives affecting all dimensions that involve both people and the organization itself rodríguez abitia bribiesca correa that is digital transformation must be a comprehensive and holistic transformation and must be approached from a perspective technological organizational and social castro benavides et al in this context the changes that have occurred within universities are evident in different scenarios such as teaching infrastructure curriculum administration research and extension business processes resources humans governance of digital transformation information and digital marketing castro benavides et al this diversity makes it understandable as castro summarizes benavides et al that within higher education institutions the digital transformation has been approached from different perspectives organizational socio cultural and technological the importance of perspective is notablechapter theoretical framework organizational because companies that wish to progress in the transformation must start from the top gurbaxani dunkle as well as link four main subdimensions business processes administration information and governance of digital transformation summarizes castro benavides et al for another side from the socio cultural perspective the worldview culture and competencies digital technologies of students teachers administrators stakeholders are vital in the process of digital transformation because organizational change is related to people processes strategies structures and competitive dynamics is where they reside most of the challenges and opportunities wade becoming a task that it must be faced with deep sensitivity and attention to overcome the natural resistance to change of the different dependencies or departments j a faria nóvoa finally from the technological perspective where digital technologies exist cross border technologies iot devices d printing and big data analysis drive transformations that go far beyond the optimizations of internal processes since that can induce drastic changes in business models organizational culture and corporate and industry wide structures nadkarni prügl as consequently the university must provide flexible technologies new platforms business and an operational backbone is solid and scalable as part of a agile digital infrastructure nadkarni prügl to support the business model human resources missionary processes teaching extension and research as well as innovation administrative processes access to information new markets always focusing on the user as the center of development castro benavides et al transformation maturity levels digital the dynamic and evolutionary nature of digital transformation takes place in the universities while they are impacted by technology this process of evolution is defined by proposals of digital maturity understanding it as the state of the digital transformation of a company and the description of what a company has already achieved in terms of carrying out transformation efforts although there is no approach standard to describe digital maturity levels teichert the author idc infodoc defines that a transformation process must incorporate several states of digital transformation in heis deployment model maturity these efforts could include changes that are achieved from a point of view operational as well as meta skills acquired with respect to mastering the change chanias hess from a content perspective the dimensions typical covers the strategic aspects of transformation management the core of the business that includes the offer of digital products and services the digitalization of internal processes and operations digital interaction with the customer as well as the use and it development chanias hess from an organizational context it refers to the meta rules that shape the organization s rules and actions and give them meaning new directions and options must be created for the organization amir uri these models are particularly relevant when both metacapabilities in terms transformation management as technology driven changes in products processes or business models must be considered from a perspective holistic chanias hess table describes the maturity levels of the different model proposals most relevant digital transformation found in the literature table maturity levels of different transformation model proposals digital found in the literature digital maturity models levels aslanova iv

beginners no digital resistant no level tests the beginners still a strategy of defined objectives nor top management has been at the beginning of its digital transformation organizational structure ada recognized the need for digital transformation they use collect and analyze traditional digital media information about your effort provided e g erp systems development or do not have the individual and the first resources to but do not use or exploit the intention to develop a benefits obtained carry out activities opportunities offered by the digitalization strategy is not always digital in addition it is advanced means on the one hand absolutely this is a type that extends to the rest of the the reason for this may be that traditional organization departments and at first experiments are unaware of the possibilities it is difficult for them to carry out a corporation with products and new technologies changes in digital services processes digital are skeptical about business management may not respect them or have be directed to administer started to use them a modern organization ineffective way on the other hand staff may not have a company could also the necessary skills choose to be beginner this to work with technologies could be due to the type of modern industrial technical equipment e g chemical of the organization also engineering or relations may not allow commercial bb vs bc that business digitization used to make their operations chapter theoretical framework catching ups digital explorer level organizations of this type identify initiatives establishment the they are only going to develop a transformation that company has won a transformation strategy have been successful in understanding digital are aware of their past and are departmental need but they don t have it they begin to replicate the need to the direction is visionary timely the transform are aware of how the company has digitally and need for change and digital projects are identified prepared for it just as the need to have a high priority than the employees the transform company has the equipment technician needed or ready to buy it digital player level consolidation fashionistas can give corporate objectives management has defined a good impression medium term strategic objectives externally however incorporate initiatives for transformation lack depth and of product and digital and drives consolidation the next customer experience transformation as a critical challenge for them is digital although still change project coordinate its activities they do not focus on the strategic digital channels to create value disruptive potential of digital and mobile is general collective the transformation have integrated into the digital transformer core processes the capabilities of digital transformation are per fectly adapted and incorporated into the processes and objectives of the company he business starts get advantages competitive about their competitors off piste has a level structuring the conservatives for the digitalization strategy there is a contrary roadmap they describe the but it has difficulties for digital and a strategy companies that are aware implement it the digital transformation direction of it potential wants to change the dedicated one the new advanced and are capable of organization to satisfy technologies manage them effectively the demands of the regularly in a they may be experts in the time on the way to early stage the digital field and are very successful digitization if processes are aware of the need to find automated problems and digital transformation of the associated with resources use enterprise analysis however see the human the technical offer the advanced new technologies with data digitization etc skepticism because of his conservatism and caution could lose valuable opportunities to add value to the company and run the risk of become less competitive leaders have a digital disruptor level optimization digitalization and organization strategy is certain areas they implement it due to how highly disruptive in functional terms they are generally it is about the market expanding the modern organizations of the use of technology and digital transformation is who have a model of new models of a business objective business that has been predetermined by the modernized and adapted to the management and has been era of digitalization translated into objectives management has a type of measurable and operational leadership thinking the digital potential in that leads the organization to activities and processes success the organization has digital transformation in heis deployment model the necessary technical base plants are used the employees have the maximum skills and competencies necessary to work with she after analyzing the literature on different digital maturity models and their levels the following levels of digital maturity were consolidated in educational institutions superior no degree the university lacks defined objectives and transformation strategy digital the success of some digital initiatives usually depends on individual effort and benefits obtained do not extend to the rest of the departments programs and or faculties it lacks information digitization processes or this process is barely beginning the staff students teachers administrators have little or no skills digital the technology available to the university does not allow the digitization of the administrative management missional and support processes low grade the university ity has identified the need to increase the execution of digital initiatives to solve some problems in the processes administrative management missional and support and allocates financial resources for its execution however he continues without changing his vision of the world likewise they identify some internal digital product and service initiatives that have been successful in the past and are beginning to be replicated in other departments programs and or faculties he staff students teachers administrators support staff have skills basic digital there is strong resistance to change the university has some technological equipment to execute digital initiatives and budget availability required to acquire other equipment is restricted moderate degree the university analyzes its world view and considers conducting a internal change the university sees the need to make changes to the objectives universities in the medium term and incorporates digitalization automation initiatives and digital user experiences modifies some governance procedures curricula and or teaching pedagogies although it does not yet focus on the potential disruptive of transformation therefore the investment and use of new technologies is done with caution chapter theoretical framework staff students teachers administrators have digital skills moderate and resistance to change is still evident high degree the university has understood accepted and internalized the new paradigm digital has decided to transform therefore digital transformation capabilities of the university are adopted and incorporated into the vision strategy objectives and university processes it has strategic planning leaders and budget that enables the transition to the new paradigm of digital transformation the processes missionary administration management and support of the university are modernized centered on the user and adapted to the digital age new procedures of governance curricula and or new teaching pedagogies university begins to obtain competitive advantages over other universities the staff students teachers administrators support staff have the required digital skills resistance to change does not persist digital culture has been internalized university it has the necessary technology to achieve digital transformation very high degree the university is very innovative and disruptive through the use of technology and new business models the university flows naturally in the new digital paradigm the university is always evaluating new technologies and its possible application processes are automated and data analysis is used advanced for decision making it is an intelligent and visionary university he staff students teachers administrators are immersed in a new culture digital perspectives on digital transformation digital transformation generates changes in meaning affecting the culture immersed in the administrative and training activities of the university its evaluations approaches pedagogical teaching research extension and administration processes as well as the people immersed in it it does not refer only to the investment that universities do in technology but also how they use this investment and make the leadership changes necessary for successful digital transformation to occur for another on the other hand digital transformation not only attempts to measure the extent to which an organization is able to benefit from the use of it but is also seen as an evolutionary process a digital transformation in heis deployment model through which it becomes a fundamental element of your daily life affecting all dimensions that involve both people and the organization itself rodríguez abitia bribiesca correa the radical and rapid changes that require internally and in the environment make the importance of managing this type of change is extremely significant for the survival and success of the organization the author tichy argues that three different perspectives coexist in organizational theory and practice representing different ways of explaining the organizational technical political and cultural reality the technical paradigm is greatly limited measure to organize the most effective way to get the job done the political paradigm includes theories of exchange conflict power and coalition problems and allocation of rewards and limits its scope to political aspects finally the cultural paradigm it restricts much of its scope to cultural aspects tichy suggests integrating the three previous perspectives in a higher level organizational paradigm than encompasses everything on the other hand the authors gurbaxani dunkle express that the transformation digital requires a useful framework that encompasses strategic technological of human capital and organizational culture furthermore interventions that aim to facilitating a paradigm shift must include changes not only in the purpose of the organization but also in its three basic subsystems otherwise the change will not it will remain from this perspective second order change interventions should aim to change not only the values norms attitudes structures and technology but also the power structure gurbaxani dunkle the digital transformation in higher education institutions requires rethinking restructure and reinvent from its multipurpose multiprocess nature multidisciplinary multistate and multiactor it s a collective effort tive that places the person at the center of the process of development transformation and impact on society that is to say digital transformation must be a comprehensive and holistic transformation of institutions of higher education and must be approached from a technological perspective organizational and social castro benavides et al in the following paragraphs will describe these perspectives chapter theoretical framework organizational perspective the importance of the organizational perspective in the process of digital transformation of higher education institutions this section consolidates the specific dimensions that the researchers have selected separately in relationship with this perspective resulting in the emergence of four subdimensions information administration business process and governance of the digital transformation matt et al rosing etzel castro benavides et al information dimension inf mancini s law states organizations are information network systems they only work effectively when there are clear and predictable information flows within and between these networks today more than ever business processes are interconnected and content information is key in an increasing number of processes i scoop the dimension of information in digital transformation is a very valuable asset and information is at the very center of that transformation by which must be aligned and consistent with the business architecture of the institutions of higher education castro benavides et al the information or content or data is a key success factor in addition to human factors leadership processes the organization etc which also require information i scoop with in order to enrich the internal process of strategic formulation and implementation the data acquired from various sources can be optimized to plan the business of more agile and effective way on the other hand under current conditions the materials educational materials are created in digital formats and have become the key facilitator of online education sandhu thoring et al grab et al the universities should improve the use of data and information in all processes of decision support whether at an operational or strategic level allowing decisions to be made based on real data faria nóvoa furthermore for the successful implementation of digital transformation data governance must be considered as noted abdulfattah almaghthawi including security agreements and protection data and regulations rodrigues also as proposed by castro benavides et al the information must be aligned consistently with the architecture digital transformation in heis implementation model ation business of higher education institutions to ensure the effective management of data transformation and digital adoption of the business business process dimension proc digital transformation being an organizational transformation allows the university create improve and reinvent operational processes as well as replace traditional services with digital services that simplify processes involved in the provision of services reducing operational complexity castro benavides et al business process optimization is the optimization of individual business processes within that holistic perspective and this is what corresponds to customer centric optimization needs the clients and stakeholders they should not see silos or internal divisions in the processes simply interact with organizations in the context of a business process and the result that interaction is what they want to see i scoop the changes which are found largely in the business process they induce changes in other processes strategies and the company as a whole krell gale for example university digitization of administrative processes provides unrestricted hour access to the entire information and services using multiple platforms or digital curricula rodrigues likewise the digital services offered at the level of educational institutions superior facilitate communication collaboration and co creation of value in all stakeholders castro benavides et al on the other hand process automation business and data digitization can increase agility in business institutions higher education but also significantly increase the risks of cybersecurity and threat levels rodrigues from the point of view of the teaching the modernization of study plans is promoted to satisfy the contemporary educational standards and methods which seek to update the program educational without the barriers of time and space as well as the development of international studies the search for new ways of delivering content through digital learning and the expansion of the use of ict technologies allowing a flexible response to the needs of the labor market castro benavides et al over time for universities the ir stem curriculum will need to focus on emerging technologies robotics ai iot nanomaterials genomics and biotechnology to provide a workforce not only capable of developing new applications andchapter theoretical framework products but also capable of interpreting the effects of these technologies on the society and use their training to provide sustainable and ethical uses of science and technology penprase dimension administration admn there are strategies that change the content and thus improve the current situation by on the other hand there are strategies that change the context creating new trajectories and options for the organization amir uri transformation strategies digital acquire the second perspective they focus on the transformation of products processes and organizational aspects due to new technologies matt et al digital transformation understands that structural changes must be carried out therefore leadership and support from top management are required the source of change is within the organization the decision making process begins with the emergence of assumptions from a new perspective this change is triggered by management behavior decision making processes decision making and strategic planning management in a digital world requires rethinking strategies of the company business models and key business drivers for success gurbaxani dunkle requires a method that changes the entire context of the problem and open new projections for the organization amir uri to apply digital transformation in higher education institutions it is required that the rectory is aware that digital transformation is promoted through decisions and strategies at the business level g sandhu and that recognizes the heterogeneity of processes and practices that will improve the overall efficiency of the university as a whole faria nóvoa the authors amir uri citing to meyer advised that structure which is initially an accommodation to environment eventually becomes an impediment to change and must be altered fundamentally p this means that organizational hierarchies are will flatten as employees gain more autonomy and participate in decision making organizational decisions schwarzmüller et al on the other hand it is necessary for it business leaders to direct the processes of business reengineering retrain people transform services implementing digital initiatives in an integrated manner and managing the implementation of digital transformation in heis deployment model digital transformation related to changes in it infrastructure and its services castro benavides et al dolganova additionally the leaders of the entire company must know and stay up to date with digital trends implications of those trends and how to take advantage of new technologies harvard business review analytic services in this sense the executive team must have the ability to define and lead a digital transformation strategy with a team of strong specialized leadership who can confidently explain and implement the transformation n digital in the institution castro benavides et al strategic planning dimension plan the strategic choices made by leaders are essential to understanding how organizations adapt to the environment amir uri with respect to digital transformation requires a well planned digital strategy a roadmap clear including the digital transformation framework in which all key actors and stakeholders can play an active role in shaping a university that thrives in the digital age gobble g sandhu for example in a world digital companies must continually align their business structures with the new technologies to benefit from standardization and automation fischer et al the importance of strategic alignment and governance is evident in the need to establish a digital strategy and ensure agility collaboration and digital experience fischer et al among the most important tasks to do operational the roadmap is alignment with the leadership team the digital director cdo as well as missionary operational leaders and the implementation of resources necessary to comply with it mckinsey company in a transformation process digital alignment and collaboration must flow between the management and purchasing teams digital and business units fischer et al on the other hand changes are costly therefore the development of processes that allow minimizing the cost of change teece et al some authors mention the importance of having a budget reserved for digital transformation bendor that is digital transformation requires large investments to get rid of the past and adopt new and disruptive technologies as well as the support of adequate resources it infrastructure financing and personnel castro benavides et al chapter theoretical framework socio cultural perspective cult the worldview culture and digital skills of the community university students teachers administrative staff and stakeholders are vital in the digital transformation process in all organizations including universities since organizational change is related to people processes strategies structures and competitive dynamics is where the most of the challenges and opportunities wade to understand the transformation of systems perhaps first a conceptual transformation is needed that allows people see the process of social change differently if the systemic evolution were seen as a dynamic process it would be easier to see the objective of the change of the social systems not as the creation of a static final state but as a process continuous of human and social growth this means that instead of trying to stop the growth of a social system at a particular stage people would strive to participate openly and fully in the natural and inevitable process of the evolution of the social systems elgin bushnell consequently it is important to consider the change management as a necessary strategy for the success of digital transformation in higher education institutions castro benavides et al this is one task that must be approached with deep sensitivity and attention to overcome resistance natural to change j a faria nóvoa to the extent that something is highly institutionalized will have strong cultural persistence lawrence furthermore the ability to adapt quickly to change is also highlighted as a important capacity experts have said that agility is more important than technological skills the st century is about agility adjustment adaptation and creation of new opportunities bondar et al to ensure the sustainability of the transformation companies rely on an open culture that facilitates creativity and risk taking fischer et al the human capacity for creative thinking creative behavior and innovation is an important source of change organizational this perspective is the most compatible with the choice perspective strategic or management the source of change is in the system and capabilities unique abilities of people to be innovative and creative amir uri an organizational transformation will be successful with competent people who really understand the meaning and complexity of digitalization and the talent available in the digital transformation in heis deployment model company to support it gurbaxani dunkle at the university the capabilities digital hr are the key enabler of digital transformation university through the competent digital workforce and are the capabilities that enable someone to live learn and work in a digital society g sandhu that is a highly professional workforce with digital skills and competence in the field of technology and communication azarenko et al equipment self managed in the work environment grab et al with skills to solve problems creativity the ability to efficiently handle large quantities of information social skills and quick decision making for leaders tolerate ambiguity as well as inspiring followers seems to have become most crucial skills in the digital age schwarzmüller et al emphasizing that innovations in digital teaching are not only technical innovations but also academic curricular organizational and structural innovations in this sense it is perceived that the use of digital educational resources allows new roles for teachers and students creating flexible and motivating ways of learning and being more autonomous and collaborative fleacă this is how the teacher training unit becomes an important player in the digital transformation process due to the important challenge of digital literacy among all actors that requires them update your skills in the field globally the principles of education in the areas of customization flexible design and integration of various trajectories educational and labor castro benavides et al technological and physical infrastructure perspective tec the fourth industrial revolution is often described as the result of integration and the combined effects of multiple exponential technologies such as intelligence artificial intelligence ai biotechnologies and nanomaterials penprase the transformations that occurred within the businesses were focused mainly on the introduction of internal management information systems such as planning enterprise resources erp or customer relationship management crm today in day in addition to these transformations the university must provide flexible it new business platforms and a strong scalable operational backbone as part of an agile digital infrastructure nadkarni prügl to support the human resources teaching innovation administration access opening ofchapter theoretical framework market construction process society and research castro benavides et al measuring the benefit obtained from it cannot be seen from a single point point of view and should be considered a matter of properly aligning the objectives organizational with the implementation and use of it rodríguez abitia bribiesca correa on the other hand the university must have physical infrastructure to meet contemporary educational standards and methods i e institutes of innovation teaching laboratories digital training units buildings laboratories for teaching in accordance with digital and innovation scenarios castro benavides et al an example is presented by hulla et al when raising the creation of innovation institutes as a very important infrastructure resource where case study based training laboratories can operate empirical study design this chapter addresses the aspects related to the design of the empirical study starting with the description of the theoretical model and hypotheses also it is described the process that was carried out to validate the content of the measuring instrument of digital transformation in higher education institutions absent in the literature and leveraged on the m theoretical arc and analysis carried out in chapter the process of submission to content validation carried out by experts also detailed in this chapter this measuring instrument will be applied to obtain the information and subsequent evaluation of the relationships between the different perspectives organizational socio cultural and technological and the maturity of digital transformation in institutions

nature of digital transformation takes place in the universities that are impacted by technology this evolution process is defined by the digital maturity proposals it is understood as the state of digital transformation of a company and describes what a company has already achieved in terms of carrying out transformation efforts although there is no standard approach to describe the levels of digital maturity teichert the idc infodoc states that a complete transformation process must incorporate various states of maturity based on the analysis of the different digital maturity models described in section the following levels of digital maturity are created and proposed focused on the higher education institutions see table digital transformation in heis deployment model table maturity levels of digital transformation in educational institutions higher education no degree the university lacks defined objectives and digital transformation strategy the success of some digital initiatives usually depends on individual effort and the benefits obtained do not extend to the rest of the departments programs and or faculties it lacks information digitization processes or this process is barely beginning the staff students teachers administrators have little or no digital skills the technology available to the university does not allow the digitalization of administrative management processes missional and support low grade the university has identified the need to increase the execution of digital initiatives to provide a solution to some problems in administrative management missionary and support processes and allocates financial resources for its execution however his vision of the world continues without changing likewise some internal initiatives for digital products and services that have been successful in the market are identified past and are beginning to be replicated in other departments programs and or faculties the staff students teachers adm inistratives support staff has basic digital skills there is a strong resistance to change the university has some technological equipment to execute digital initiatives and budget availability required to acquire other equipment is restricted moderate degree the university looks at its worldview and considers making an internal change the university sees the need to make changes in the university objectives in the medium term and incorporates initiatives of digitization automation and digital user experiences modifies some governance procedures curricula and or teaching pedagogies although it does not yet focus on the disruptive potential of the transformation therefore the investment and use of new technologies is done with caution the staff students teachers administrators have moderate digital skills and it is still evident resistance to change high grade the university has understood accepted and internalized the new digital paradigm it has decided to transform itself for the therefore the university s digital transformation capabilities are adopted and incorporated into the vision strategy objectives and processes of the university it has strategic planning leaders and budget that enables the transition to the new paradigm of digital transformation the missionary administration management and support processes of the university are modernized focused on the user and adapted to the digital era new governance procedures curricula and or new pedagogies of teaching the university begins to obtain competitive advantages over other universities the staff students teachers administrators support staff have the required digital skills do not resistance to change persists digital culture has been internalized the university has the necessary technology to achieve digital transformation very high grade the university is very innovative and disruptive through the use of technology and new business models the university flows naturally in the new digital paradigm the university is always evaluating new technologies and their possible application the processes are automated and advanced data analysis is used for decision making it is an intelligent and visionary university the staff students teachers administrators are immersed in a new digital culture chapter design of the empirical study organizational perspective and perspectives socio cultural and technological the importance of the organizational perspective in the process of digital transformation of higher education institutions the companies that wishing to advance the transformation must begin with senior management gurbaxani dunkle this dimension consolidates most of the determined dimensions that investigations have had been chosen separately around this perspective and emerged mainly four dimensions business process administration information and governance of digital transformation matt et al gobble rossmann reutlingen gurbaxani dunkle rosing etzel castro benavides et al a organizational change is related to people processes strategies competitive structures and dynamics which is where most of the challenges and opportunities wade in particular the strategy is related to the organizational capabilities represents how the organization will respond to changes of the environment and thus satisfy customer expectations respond to the competition its essence is to create and use competitive advantage chandler currently require dynamic capabilities understood as the capacity within an organization to integrate build and reconfigure its competencies internal external and thus respond to the changes demanded by a dynamic environment flexible timely and fast manner miranda torrez teece et al in consequently it is important to consider change management as a strategy necessary for the success of digital transformation in educational institutions higher castro benavides et al on the one hand the university must provide flexible it new platforms business and a strong scalable operational backbone as part of a agile digital infrastructure nadkarni prügl to support human resources teaching innovation administration access market opening process of construction society and research castro benavides et al as well as also facilitate the analysis and application of technological scope models tam utaut tam toe security and trust model among others that guarantee the university than the different users teachers students administrators general community digital transformation in heis deployment model will adopt the multiple and diverse systems of technological and educational innovation while consider them useful and easy to use martín garcía et al palos sanchez et al sebastián et al technological perspective and

higher education institutions organizational change is related to people processes strategies competitive structures and dynamics that is where most of the challenges and opportunities wade as well as technological changes and chapter design of the empirical study technological knowledge depends strongly on the social contexts in which it is develops depends on many people on the institutions that interact with it for a long period of time pinch bijker valderrama therefore the worldview culture and digital skills of students teachers administrative stakeholders are vital in the digital transformation process throughout organization including universities within the evolution process of the digital transformation that takes place in the universities applied efforts are included to achieve changes from a point of operational view as well as acquired meta skills regarding the process domain of change chanias hess from a content perspective the dimensions typical covers the strategic aspects of transformation management the core of the business that includes the offer of digital products and services the digitalization of internal processes and operations digital interaction with the user as well as the use and it development chanias hess these models are particularly relevant when both the metacapabilities in terms of transformation management and the technological changes in products processes or business models are considered from a holistic perspective chanias hess theoretical model and hypotheses higher education institutions are very attentive to the development of the digital transformation and are trying to change their current paradigm the current state of the research lacks a model of theoretical and methodological maturity deep for digital transformation not only in the it business but also in the higher education institutions castro benavides et al gollhardt et al therefore based on the analysis carried out on the theoretical framework described in chapter and the previous sections in this chapter describe and present hypotheses between the perspectives and corresponding criteria for the implementation of a digital transformation in higher education institutions the present study contemplates three dimensions that could positively influence the maturity of the digital transformation in higher education institutions perspective organizational subdimensions information business processes digital transformation in heis implementation model management administration and strategic planning socio cultural perspective and technological perspective based on the previous discussion the following hypotheses are proposed h organizational perspective has a direct positive influence on perspective socio cultural ha organizational perspective has a positive indirect influence on maturity of the digital transformation of higher education institutions through socio cultural perspective hb organizational perspective has a positive indirect influence on maturity of the digital transformation of higher education institutions through technological perspective h organizational perspective has a direct positive influence on perspective technological h the technological perspective has a direct positive influence on the maturity of the digital transformation of higher education institutions ha the technological perspective has a positive indirect influence on the maturity of the digital transformation of higher education institutions through socio cultural perspective h the technological perspective has a direct positive influence on the socio economic perspective cultural h the socio cultural perspective has a direct positive influence on the maturity of the digital transformation of higher education institutions the hypothetical relationships investigated are illustrated in figure chapter empirical study design figure interrelationships between digital transformation perspectives in higher education institutions implementation model design and validation of content transformation measuring instrument digital in education institutions superior validity a commonly accepted definition of the validity of an instrument is the extent to which the instrument measures what it purports to measure slocumb cole it is also considered a vital factor in the selection or application of an instrument zamanzadeh et al and serves as a guide to determine the appropriate implications of the study findings slocumb cole specifically validity is determined by examining concepts related to construct criterion and content validity devon block moyle wright et al construct validity refers to how well an instrument identifies measures correct operationalizations for the theoretical concepts under study sampieri et al yin the criterion validity of a measurement instrument is established by comparing its results with those of a certain external criterion that tries to measure the same sampieri digital transformation in heis implementation model et al and finding a statistically significant relationship between a measure and a criterion rubio et al and content validity refers to the degree to which the items of an instrument are a representative sample of the content domain being measured escurra devon block moyle wright et al magdalena et al zamanzadeh et al content validity content validity reveals a full range of the attribute under study devon block moyle wright et al in terms of clarity coherence relevance and sufficiency of the dimension item with respect to a content domain carbajal tamari to develop a set of scale items a researcher first defines the construct of interest and its dimensions searching the literature through opinions of experts carrying out population sampling or through qualitative research devon block moyle wright et al on the other hand content validity can be characterize as face validity or logical validity face validity indicates that the measure appears to be valid at first glance logical validity indicates a more process rigorous focused on an evaluation provided by expert judges so that information can be provided about the representativeness and clarity of the elements and offer concrete suggestions to improve the quality of the instrument rubio et al zamanzadeh et al if experts in the field are perceived as true experts it is unlikely that there is a higher authority that questions the assumption validity of the test content lawshe in summary escobar pérez cuervo martínez suggests the following categories to evaluate the validity of content of a measuring instrument sufficiency clarity coherence relevance and the rating scale does not meet criteria low level moderate level high level finally numerous analytical techniques have been proposed to quantify the degree of agreement of experts on the relevance of the content of an instrument among the most used are aiken s v coefficient aiken the validity index of lawshe s content cvi lawshe the content validity index cvr and the content validity coefficient cvc hernandez nieto and pedrosa et al detail other techniques the main ones are described below chapter design of the empirical study v of aiken aiken s v coefficient is considered the most relevant statistic to evaluate validity of content escurra evaluate the relevance of each item with respect to its construct but also considers not only the number of categories offered to the judges but the number of participating experts additionally the ratings assigned they can be dichotomous values of or or polychotomous values of to pedrosa et al the v statistic is calculated using equation 𝑋 𝑙 𝑉 𝑘 where 𝑋 represents the median of the judges ratings 𝑙 represents the value lowest possible and 𝑘 represents the range of possible values within the scale of measurement used the 𝑉 statistic provides an index that goes from to we obtain a value of 𝑉 equal to when all judges select the lowest possible score and a value of 𝑉 equal to when all judges select the highest score possible penfield giacobbi furthermore the result can be evaluated statistically using the table in the right tail of associated probabilities and accepting as valid only the elements which are statistically significant at as shown in table if there are nine judges and four scale levels an aiken v of should be obtained for a statistical significance level of p and for the item to be considered valid escurra table right tailed probabilities p for validity coefficient values v adapted from aiken number of rating categories c no items m or qualifications n v p digital transformation in heis deployment model furthermore the calculation of the confidence intervals for this coefficient allows us contrast whether the magnitude obtained from the coefficient is greater than that established as minimally acceptable to conclude the content validity of the items juárez hernández tobón the confidence interval for aiken s v can be calculated with equations and where l refers to the lower limit and u to the upper limit of a c score confidence interval for v p 𝑛𝑘𝑉 𝑧 𝑧 𝑛𝑘𝑉 𝑉 𝑧 𝐿 𝑛𝑘 𝑧 𝑛𝑘𝑉 𝑧 𝑧 𝑛𝑘𝑉 𝑉 𝑧 𝑈 𝑛𝑘 𝑧 in equations and z corresponds to the standard value of the normal distribution such that the c of the distribution area is between z and z for example for an interval of confidence z penfield giacobbi lawshe content validity index cvi lawshe s content validity index cvi determines a quantitative index for measure the content validity of an instrument the index requires that expert judges evaluate whether the skill or knowledge measured by the item is essential useful but not essential or not necessary for the performance of their job lawshe the cvi is the average of the values of the items retained by applying the validity relationship of the content cvr proposed by lawshe the formula to calculate the cvr is 𝑁 𝐶𝑉𝑅 𝑛𝑒 𝑁 when 𝑛 the number of expert judges who agree with the category 𝑒 essential and n the total number of expert judges lawshe presents this expression to be interpreted as a correlation since he takes values from to then cvr will be negative if less than half of the judges are agree cvr is null if exactly half of the participants agree and cvr is positive if more than half agree magdalena et al chapter empirical study design additionally table explained by lawshe presents the values cvr minimums with single tailed test as p content validity coefficient cvc the content validity coefficient cvc is an index that measures the validity of content based on agreement between judges the author hernandez nieto recommends the participation of three to five expert judges and the use of a likert scale of five alternatives it is calculated with the average of one of the items between the maximum score that could obtain the item consequently the error assigned to each element is calculated pe the formula to calculate cvc is yo cvc cvc pe i i likewise it recommends keeping only those items with a coefficient greater than while balbinotti in juárez hernández tobón suggests keeping those items with a coefficient greater than the cvc evaluation scale is presented in table table cvc evaluation scale values interpretation to not acceptable to very low to low to moderately low to good to excellent in the content validity of the instrument the agreement of the judges must be in the upper range of the scale hernandez nieto zamanzadeh et al consensus between the judges an equivalent phrase for consensus general agreement might be the collective opinion of a group considering that a certain degree of variation is possible between individuals william j tastle wierman on the other hand dissent is defined as a difference of opinion so that conflict occurs within the group involved in making a decision william j tastle wierman digital transformation in heis deployment model within the context of content validation if revisions are required important to the measurement of the instrument the researcher can repeat the process rubio et al when the result of the agreement measure is high it indicates that there is consensus in the process of classification or assignment of scores among evaluators equally nte accounts for the interchangeability of measuring instruments and reproducibility of the measure escobar pérez cuervo martínez there are several techniques to determine this agreement including kappa statistics bernal garcía et al escobar pérez cuervo martínez hernandez nieto kendall s w escobar pérez cuervo martínez zamora de ortiz et al and wierman w j tastle wierman kappa statistician this statistic generates a measure of agreement it is only used in nominal data without however there is a generalization to include ordinal data called coefficient k weighted escobar pérez cuervo martínez the statistic has a range between and but generally lies between and if the coefficient is it indicates perfect agreement between the evaluators if it is it indicates that the agreement is not greater than that expected by the random and if the value of the coefficient is negative the level of agreement is lower than expected by randomness escobar pérez cuervo martínez kappa values greater than indicate excellent agreement those between and are defined as acceptable agreement and values below are they consider agreement poor or unacceptable hernandez nieto for him on the contrary cortés reyes et al suggest another interpretation poor or weak for kappa values below moderate for values between and good between and and very good for higher kappa values up to kendall s w kendall s w is a non parametric rank test that indicates the degree of association o level of agreement between the average ranges of the evaluations made by judges experts according to an ordinal scale zamora de ortiz et al an interpretation of kendall s w is presented in table chapter design of the empirical study table interpretation of kendall s w taken from schmidt kendall s w interpretation classification w very weak consensus none w low weak consensus w moderate consensus moderate w strong high consensus w exceptionally strong consensus very high tastle wierman consensus the tastle wierman consensus is a measure of dispersion used to determine the consensus and dissent the measure is applied to a likert scale or any scale ordinal with this measure data on ordinal scales can be given a value of dispersion that is logically and theoretically sound w j tastle wierman villaverde kosheleva the minimum value that the coefficient assumes is and the maximum es the authors william j tastle wierman have not defined parameters for interpret this index therefore they are interpreted in the same way as kendall s w the average ratings for each item are also used to calculate the ranking end of a full round okoli pawlows ki the practical applications of this index can be consulted in studies such as villaverde kosheleva w j tastle wierman expert judgment the first objective of content validity is to obtain the opinion of expert judges who support or reject the appropriate operational definition of the variables within the universe of conceptual content and reach consensus to achieve this goal they have proposed various consensus methods such as group methods or by unique expert methods you can follow among others the aggregate method individual the delphi method the nominal group technique and the group consensus method corral among the individual techniques is the aggregate method individual and the delphi method both require interaction with experts but in the latter a higher level of agreement is required escobar pérez cuervo martínez likewise if used systematically and rigorously this method can contribute significantly to expand knowledge hasson et al this study follows the delphi method detailed below digital transformation in heis deployment model delphi method the prospective delphi method consists of a technique for obtaining information based in consulting experts in an area in order to obtain a consensus opinion and reliable lópez vidal africa calvo although in the literature a exact number of judges it is recommended to have a group of at least five people to have sufficient control over the agreement each judge carries out the evaluation of the quantitative and qualitative opinions on the items after analyzing their answers the research team sends the resulting median to each judge requesting that reconsider validate your judgment until you reach a consensus escobar pérez cuervo martínez zamanzadeh et al to verify the consensus reached in the responses the use of the coefficient is suggested of tastle wierman consensus when consensus there is good agreement and the round ends expert competence coefficient k one way to select experts is through the analysis of their relevance as experts by calculating the expert competence coefficient k mengual andrés et al using formula 𝐾 𝐾 𝐾 𝑐 𝑎 𝐾 is the knowledge or information coefficient that represents a measure of the level of 𝑐 knowledge on the subject the judge s self assessment is required on a discrete scale from to and then multiplied by 𝐾 is the argumentation coefficient or substantiation of the experts criteria 𝑎 the judge evaluates himself by addressing six possible sources of argument cruz ramírez martínez cepena see table chapter design of the empirical study table degree of influence of the source on your criteria gra influence of the source on your judgment source of argument or justification high medium low theoretical analyzes that have been carried out your experience gained works by national authors works by international authors your own knowledge of the state of the problem abroad your intuition after obtaining the final value experts with a score lower than are not included in the study zartha sossa et al the following section provides a detailed description of the systematic process and is analyze the results obtained method this is a quantitative non experimental descriptive study during the process collected the qualitative and quantitative points of view of expert judges regarding the research topic following the methodology proposed by hasson et al study design a web based delphi process was developed to involve expert judges and validate the content of the measurement instrument with respect to the implementation of the digital transformation in higher education institutions the steps were followed a preparation of instructions and spreadsheets b commitment with experts delphi method and c collection and analysis of results o preparation of instructions and spreadsheets prior to developing the instrument a review of the literature was carried out that allowed identify twenty nine items grouped mainly into four dimensions twelve of them belonging to the organizational perspective seven belonging to the socio cultural perspective five that represent the technological perspective and five related to the maturity of the digital transformation in higher education institutions see annex a digital transformation in heis deployment model subsequently so that the information was collected in an operable form the items were adjusted and organized in an appropriate format and sequence zamanzadeh et al furthermore the instructions to the judges about the dimensions and the indicator that measures each item or group of items were explained in detail through a video a cover letter and written documents suggested by escobar pérez cuervo martínez finally the study respected ethical considerations such as acceptance permission to use and safeguard the information provided by the judges experts o selection of experts delphi method the sample selection was non probabilistic purposeful and critical taherdoost et al according to the interest in participating in the study knowledge about the topic of digital transformation in higher education institutions experience and availability some experts were contacted through emails electronic available in the different scientific articles on digital transformation and others recognized experts in different countries initially a list of thirty five was designed two potential judges each of whom received a cover letter and invitation to take part in the evaluation trial eleven judges accepted it was requested to the expert judges who responded to the self assessment that meets the requirements described in section to calculate the expert competence coefficient k finally the nine experts with a k rating greater than o preparation the process was created with a criterion of seeking the participation of expert judges from different geographical regions and with heterogeneous experience the delphi method consisted of a total of nine judges four doctors five systems engineers or electricians who serve as professors deans or directors of innovation in higher education institutions the group of experts also reflected a diversity of opinions with varied geographical representation of the countries from colombia spain portugal guatemala and germany chapter design of the empirical study the role of the expert judges was to review these indicators and establish the level of agreement on the relevance coherence clarity and sufficiency of each item with respect to the construct to which it belongs o data collection the survey was conducted through the surveymonkey web application the delphi method is took place between october and november it began with the formal invitation to be part of the group of expert judges while the information on the design of the study and the link to enter the website was sent to them by email he asked the judges who accepted the invitation to respond within three weeks after receiving the email it is worth mentioning that communication and evaluation by the experts occurred asynchronously up to two were sent reminders to participants who did not complete the survey within the specified time frame and finally the survey was closed after two months with very significant contributions complete and detailed information provided by the nine judges the survey included four sections the first contained information about the study and the self assessment required to calculate the k coefficient the second concerned data c identification of the future evaluator the third described the main characteristics and dimensions of the university with their respective items along with the details of the characteristics of each construct scientific relevance and indicators to qualify each item finally the fourth section collected information from the judges self assessment to calculate the argumentation coefficient k furthermore each the section offered fields to free text for observations that the judges would like to express in this round and for each indicator the experts had to indicate their agreement or disagreement on a level likert type scale not compliant low level moderate level high level according to sufficiency clarity coherence and relevance the analysis was carried out with microsoft excel and r studio applying the consensus digital transformation in heis function deployment model statistical analysis of the data two statistics were applied to the set of responses provided by the judges specifically aiken s v escurra and the tastle consensus coefficient wierman w j tastle wierman o consensus between judges tastle wierman consensus a tastle wierman consensus value greater than or equal to would indicate that a strong consensus and the expert round would be finalized however if the value is less a the survey must be sent again to the expert judges starting a new iteration in each iteration the following information would be returned for each item the average item rating for judges the qualification that the judge gave him to the item in the previous round an indication of the current level of consensus based on the tastle wierman consensus coefficient value and a paragraph that summarizes the comments from other participants about why they evaluated that item with base in this participants review and or adjust their ratings for each item with their respective observations okoli pawlowski or v aiken the modifications made to the items by the researchers are made based on the observations of the expert judges and the results of aiken s v considering that the item is maintained if the value of aiken s v is greater than or equal to otherwise it is modified or deleted the desired result is a trend towards and new rounds can be carried out if in the first round the minimum value of is not reached in the judges agreement nor a value greater than in aiken s v coefficient with statistical significance of results and conclusions of the measuring instrument selection of judges the knowledge coefficients k and argumentation coefficient k were calculated c a obtained for each judge see table chapter design of the empirical study table knowledge coefficient k and argumentation

selection criteria presented at the beginning of the study that is a coefficient ient k greater than or equal to classified as influential content validity coefficient and consensus among judges once the coefficients per item per dimension and per instrument have been calculated annex b adequate levels are deduced in the aiken v coefficient for most of the items validating its content except for item whose clarity indicator v and for the sufficiency indicator of the business processes subdimension v regarding the consensus among the judges calculated with the consensus coefficient it is observes a value greater than or equal to in most of the items of the instrument indicating strong consensus the exceptions are clarity of item consensus coherence v relevance consensus and clarity

consensus clarity of item consensus relevance consensus and item clarity consensus and in item all the indicators coherence relevance clarity consensus the analysis of content validity and consensus between judges of the entire instrument was presented in table it is observed that in all cases the aiken v coefficient is greater than with p which indicates that the items are considered valid in addition for all dimensions there is consensus greater than among all judges indicating digital transformation in heis deployment model strong consensus on the other hand the evaluation indicator of clarity in the dimension technological indicates a moderate consensus consensus table content validity confidence interval and consensus between judges experts indicators dimensions coherence relevance clarity sufficiency all dimensions v ci c v ci c v ci c v ci c v ci c organizational socio cultural technological dt maturity in response to feedback provided by experts changes were made qualitative in the wording of the questions and some of the context was modified to finalize the design of the questionnaire in conclusion the study of the validity of an instrument is a costly process that it requires time to plan and execute in that order the first critical step to carried out must be the study of content validity because this analysis verifies that the instruments used for the studies are appropriate for the c onstruct the population being investigated and the socio cultural context in which the study is immersed since content validity is a prerequisite for other types of validity it must have top priority during the development of the instrument in content validity studies researchers can receive information invaluable from expert judges who provide constructive feedback on the quality of the newly developed measures and the objective criteria with which they must evaluate each element rubio et al consequently the analysis of the consolidated results of the instrument through the aiken and consensus v coefficients indicates that the instrument has content validity and that there is a strong consensus among the judges therefore a second round was not required on the contrary values that do not exhibited statistical significance in their content validity and or had values lower than in the consensus coefficient were carefully reviewed by the chapter design of the empirical study researchers and reflecting the observations provided by the expert judges the wording and context to facilitate understanding of the item accepting the suggestion of the expert judges items and of the technological dimension were merged into a single item consequently the evaluation of the instrument described in this work facilitates obtaining of scientifically valid and reliable results to validate the relationships between the constructs organizational socio cultural and technological that impact the transformation digital in higher education institutions castro benavides et al results of the empirical study sample characteristics the report of the public universities of colombia is used as a sampling frame provided by the information system of the ministry of national education of colombia there are a total of public universities in colombia through a search the names email addresses and phone numbers were consolidated on the website telephone number of designated personnel in the public universities mainly leaders it managers directors or department heads working in ict related areas the main source for collecting information was an online survey self administered other sources in pdf format or via videoconference in a first phase communication was asynchronous through emails in a second phase communication was synchronous by telephone or videoconference he began the process by sending by email to the named persons a invitation with the main information of the research project the commitment of provide the results of the study and the link to the online survey several were sent emails and calls were made repeatedly to those who did not answer the in costs in addition some video calls were required to socialize the importance of their participation in the project the survey was delivered in spanish and was available for eight months finally responses were obtained from the universities public this

very high degree based on the literature reviewed in chapter the the survey was structured in two sections and nine international experts evaluated its content validity using the delphi method the first section contains fourteen items related to the main characteristics of the university and the interviewed the second section is related to the main perspectives there is four constructs that are operationalized as compon perspective entities organizational org information inf administration admn planning plan and process proc a total of twelve indicators were measured additionally it

the pls sem method allows the estimation of complex models that include several constructs indicator variables and structural trajectories without imposing assumptions of distribution over the data additionally it has great statistical power which means that by applying pls sem it is more likely that relationships will be identified as significant when they are in fact present in the population hair et al as pls sem is a causal predictive approach to sem it is the appropriate method for the research when its objective is the prediction and confirmation of theory dash paul hair et al additionally pls sem should be selected when a population small restricts the sample size hair et al this study used a higher order model or hierarchical component models hcm that involve testing second order structures containing two layers of components in the present study the higher order construct referring to organizational perspective org is composed of lower order reflective constructs inf admn proc plan similarly lower order constructs have a reflective measurement model the other constructs of the model such as cult tec and dt_madurez are reflective following the steps described by hair et al the the first step evaluation begins with the examination of the measurement models and in secondly the structural model is evaluated evaluation of the measurement and structural model evaluation of the measurement model first of all it is necessary to create the construct with the scores of the order construct superior org its respective components and indicators researchers must apply a combination of the repeated indicators approach and the use of scores latent variables in a two phase hcm analysis hair et al in the first phase see figure the repeated indicator approach is used to obtain the scores of the latent variables for the lower order components loc in the second phase loc scores serve as latent variables in the measurement model of higher order component hoc see figure when you apply the analysis to the two phase hcm the hoc is integrated into the nomological network in such a way thatc chapter results of the empirical study allows other latent variables not part of the hoc as predecessors explain part of their variance two phase hcm analysis can identify relationships of significant paths that would not otherwise be found f hair et al figure higher order construct org internal model path coefficients external loads outer loadings and constructs r digital transformation in heis deployment model figure structural model with path and r coefficients the evaluation of the reflective measurement model is carried out through the internal consistency cronbach s alpha and composite reliability convergent validity indicator reliability and average variance extracted ave discriminant validity fornell larcker criterion and cross loadings between indicators and latent variables and the heterotrait monotrail htmt ratio cepeda carrión roldán salgueiro internal consistency cronbach s alpha is a measure of consistency reliability internal that assumes similar thresholds but produces lower values than the reliability composite hair et al additionally cronbach s alpha is only applicable to latent variables with reflective indicators cepeda carrión roldán salgueiro higher values indicate higher levels of reliability and values of and higher high values are considered problematic as they indicate that the items are redundant which reduces construct validity all latent variable measures indicate reliability of internal consistency in the measurement model see table convergent validity the metric used to evaluate the convergent validity of a construct is the average variance extracted ave for all items of each construct an acceptable ave is or higher which establishes that more than of the chapter results of the empirical study variance of the construct is due to its indicators hair et al all the sizes of the construct are greater than see table table construct reliability and validity average of the cronbach s alpha rho_a construct composite reliability variance extracted bird cult dt_maturity org tec the factor loadings of the indicators the evaluation of the measurement model implies examine factor loadings the high values in the factor loadings reveal that the indicators associated with the construct have much in common the value of the factor loading it is also called indicator reliability loads greater than are recommended since they indicate that the construct explains more than of the variance of the indicator which provides acceptable reliability of the items hair et al however instead to automatically eliminate indicators researchers must examine undermine carefully examine the effects of item deletion on composite reliability as well as on the average extracted variance of the corresponding latent variable in generally indicators with external loads between and should be considered for removal of the scale only when the removal of the indicator leads to an increase in composite reliability or average variance extracted hair et al in consequently item cul was eliminated from the scale because doing so increases significantly the composite reliability other procs were maintained and p tec_ as shown in figure discriminant validity traditionally the fornell and larcker criterion is used to evaluate discriminant validity however the authors henseler et al demonstrate that neither the fornell larcker criterion nor the evaluation of cross loadings allow users of variance based sem to determine discriminant validity of their measures and propose a new approach called htmt if the html value is below discriminant validity is established between two reflective constructs hair et al the results show that the htmlt discriminant validity values for all constructs they are less than see table digital transformation in heis deployment model table discriminant validity

p_tec_ p_tec_ mat evaluating the structural model in the first instance the model s prediction capacity is determined and subsequently it evaluates the extent to which exogenous variables contribute to the explained variance of the endogenous variables the evaluation criteria that must be considered are coefficient of determination r which represents the predictive power of the sample because it is the squared correlation of the actual and predictive values likewise must calculate the redundancy and communality index using stone cross validation gleisser q this measure is an indicator of predictive power that measures how well they are reconstructed the values by the model and its estimated parameters and the significance and relief statistical analysis of the path coefficients hair et al that analyzes the relationships between the constructs through the values obtained from the coefficients standardized paths additionally researchers should evaluate the predictive power outside chapter results of the empirical study of their model sample using the plspredict procedure described in shmueli et al before evaluating the structural relationships of the model collinearity must be examined this verification makes it possible to ensure that there are no biases in the results of the regression hair et al although collinearity is evaluated between formative indicators in reflective models they are used to check if there are critical levels of collinearity between the sets of predictor variables therefore the values of the variance inflation factor vif hair et al collinearity vif values above are indicative of possible problems of collinearity between the predictor constructs joseph f hair et al all the vif values are less than table in that sense there are no problems of collinearity in the model table statistical collinearity vif vif internal values cult dt_maturity org tec cult dt_maturity org ect explanatory power it is required to examine the r value of the endogenous constructs the r measures the variance that is explained in each of the endogenous constructs and therefore is a measure of the explanatory power of the model the r varies between and and the r values of and can be considered substantial moderate and weak respectively joseph f hair et al the results indicate that of the variability of cult is explained by org and tec of the tec variability is explained by org specifically of the variability in dt_madurez is given by cult tec and org see table from this criterion it can be said that the cult construct has substantial explanatory power and the proposed tec and dt_maturity constructs they have moderate explanatory power digital transformation in heis deployment model table coefficient of determination r r adjusted r observation cult predictive power substantial dt_maturity predictive power moderate tec predictive power moderate predictive power another means of evaluating the predictive accuracy of the path pls model is calculate the value of q this measure is based on the blindfolding technique which uses a subset of the available data to estimate the model parameters and then predict missing data q examines whether a model accurately predicts data not used in the estimation of the model parameters noreña the small ones differences between predicted and original values results translate into a higher q value high indicating greater predictive accuracy hair et al in the model structural q values greater than zero for an endogenous latent variable reflective indicates the predictive relevance of the model for a dependent construct in particular q values greater than and represent predictive relevance small medium and large of the pls path model hair et al according to the table the latent variable cult has a great relevance of predictive power while that the relevance of predictive power based on endogenous latent variables of dt_maturity and tec is classified as average table cross validated redundancy of the construct q predictive power of the model q sso sse q sse sso remark cult large dt_maturity median org tec median additionally researchers should examine statistical prediction when interpret the results of plspredict one should focus on the endogenous constructs key within the model rather than examining the prediction errors of all indicators of endogenous constructs hair et al the reference point that it is recommended that a linear regression model lm be used to generate predictions for the manifest variables vm a set of k is established as a parameter then chapter results of the empirical study applying the suggestions or guidelines of shmueli et al it is shown that in the majority of the cases vm the values of q are greater than zero and the minority of predict indicators vm higher prediction errors occur compared to the lm benchmark this indicates that the model has a medium predictive power see table hair et al table statistical

statistical significance significance of path coefficients it is necessary to run bootstrapping to evaluate the importance of the path and evaluate their values which are generally in the range of and hair et al when running bootstrapping with bootstraps to obtain the path coefficients and their importance values are generated for the t value tests and for the levels of probability p value for all trajectories of the structural model table the model trajectories are significant with a p value or a t value in it in the case of the proposed structural model the correlations between the tec variables dt_madurity indicate a t value below the remaining values are significant at the calculation results indicate four levels of probability less than cult dt_madurez org cult org tec and tec

model through the indirect effect which is the relationship between the exogenous latent construct and the mediating variable and between the mediating variable and the endogenous latent construct therefore the mediating variables reveal the true relationship between an exogenous construct and an endogenous one hair et al for evaluate if there is mediation and if it is total or partial the direct and indirect effects are evaluated and totals according to the methodology described by hair et al total mediation occurs when the mediated indirect effect is significant but the associated direct effect is not therefore the mediating variable explains completely the relationship between an exogenous independent variable and a endogenous dependent it is also called indirect mediation only noreña partial mediation occurs when a mediating variable explains partially the relationship between an exogenous construct and an endogenous one noreña the algorithm that was followed to evaluate the mediating variables of the model is described in figure the procedure includes the analysis of the explained variance vaf for example its acronym in english as an indicator that represents the percentage of the total effect that is absorbed by the specific mediating variable hair et al in the first step without the inclusion of the mediating variables the effect of the independent variable is analyzed on the dependent is significant hair et al in the second step yes this effect direct is significant the mediating variables are included in the model and the chapter results of the empirical study significance of the total indirect effect if it is significant then the specific indirect effects evaluating their significance subsequently the vaf for vaf values

be addressed as an organizational transformation and in that sense be considered and aligned from three different perspectives organizational socio cultural and technological to achieve synchronize digital transformation in a holistic and evolutionary integration over the course weather secondly research applied to public universities in colombia through the implementation model it shows that the digital transformation is presented progressively through maturity levels none low moderate high very high evidencing how this transformation generates changes in vision and meaning within higher education institutions impacting their culture policies administrative and training activities evaluation processes pedagogical approaches teaching research and extension processes as well as people immersed in she it is a profound change that goes beyond the fact of introducing information technologies indus tria is a paradigm shift thirdly from the descriptive analysis carried out it can be said that the majority of colombia s public universities are located at a level of maturity moderate which implies that for universities the digital transformation begins to be a latent concern where they are analyzing their vision and considering making an internal change as well as a change in their medium term university objectives by on the other hand they are incorporating digitalization automation initiatives and digital user modifying some governance procedures curricula and or teaching pedagogies however still do not focus on the disruptive potential digital transformation in heis deployment model of the transformation consequently the investment and use of new technologies becomes with precaution likewise it can be said that its staff students teachers administrative has moderate digital skills and there is still evidence of resistance to change in the face of digital transformation processes fourthly it is clear that without adequate conceptual development science could not proceed beyond a certain stage lewin as the motivation for this research some theoretical and practical implications are derived see figure figure implementation model of digital transformation in institutions of higher education from the analysis of the structural model in conclusion the organizational decisions directly impact the socio cultural and technological aspects and indirectly impact the maturity of digital transformation on the other hand they exhibit an impact positive from the technological perspective in the maturity levels of the transformation digital mediated by the socio cultural perspective likewise the organizational perspective influences the socio cultural and technological dimensions and only the socio cultural aspects they directly influence the maturity levels of digital transformation in this sense the present study makes a contribution to the theory by providing evidence empirical evidence of the importance of integrating the organizational socio cultural and technology in order to improve the level of maturity of the digital transformation in the higher education institutions likewise it is confirmed that the decisions and organizational commitments information missionary processes conclusions administration management and support administration strategic planning from the high levels of university management have a concrete impact on promotion within the maturity levels of digital transformation within the institutions of higher education additionally the results suggest that universities should consider injecting their digital transformation efforts into improving socio cultural strategies in place r to maximize technology fifthly it is considered pertinent to highlight that this research achieved survey of the public universities in colombia that is universities that are dispersed throughout the national territory result that allows you to have a holistic view of the maturity of digital transformation in public universities in colombia finally based on the previous reasoning we consider that the model of implementation created is a relevant reference framework for universities since contributes to improving the understanding and management of digital transformation processes that take place inside likewise it is worth highlighting the importance of the instrument of digital transformation proposed as a diagnostic and planning tool possible projects for the development of a digital transformation strategy as a schematic visualization figure consolidates the most important elements important things that heis must take into account to increase maturity levels in digital transformation processes linking organizational perspectives socio cultural and technological as a whole digital transformation in heis deployment model figure holistic view of digital transformation in heis future lines of research future refinements of the measurement instrument are suggested by applying new variables moderators that have not been considered in this study and that could help the understanding of complex resulting relationships for example geographic area date founding of the educational institution cultural context among others new research should focus on an update and analysis of the model of digital transformation of universities in the face of the new scenarios deployed in the period of the pandemic and post pandemic because this research focused its analysis in a transition time that is a before and during similarly to beginning of the investigation it was established as the main basis for the identification of the void of knowledge and construction of the theoretical framework the systematic review of literature in scientific databases future research could integrate new perspectives from other sources of information such as reports from prestigious consulting firms international and or documented experiences of td processes as well as an analysisconclusions longitudinal transregional international evolution and prospective vision of the university framed in the context of digital transformation likewise based on the implementation model created it is suggested to generate new models that link the relationship of the third fourth and fifth helix through the digital transformation in universities it is proposed to carry out future studies that include the application of mixed methods of research that facilitate addressing broader research questions that provide a better understanding of digital transformation in heis research that measure for example the impact of digital transformation on the competitiveness of companies universities in the reduction of student dropout levels in the universities among others include private universities in the study and or expand its application to other countries which which would allow a greater number of samples to contrast the results applying cb sem leading to a better understanding of how these dimensions integrate and complement to guide digital transformation in educational institutions superior it would be very useful if each perspective organizational socio cultural and technological analyzed in this research became a research unit so such that it can be deepened in its theorization as well as in concrete strategies for its evaluation and application limitations of the study process instrument of measurement there are some limitations that need to be noted first the instrument to measure digital transformation focused on higher education institutions being a first instrument created new studies variables and or relationships could emerge particular to the contexts of each region country that have not been considered and that may eventually modify the relationships raised in the model secondly the absence of previous studies that address the issue of creation of instruments for measuring digital transformation in higher education institutions digital transformation in heis deployment model limits its comparative evaluation therefore there is a need to carry out additional research to be improved later thirdly the creation of the model is directed to the context of the heis and the population the study only included public universities in colombia finally it is important to clarify that the completion of the thesis work had different moments that included the analysis of literature until date on which publishes the article that is considered to date a bibliographical reference in similar digital transformation work the creation of the applied instrument later and which gave rise to the analysis of the context under study ies was created in the year and its application dates back to the year with conclusive data regarding the state of the art of digital transformation processes in heis in reason to this our study and contribution to the knowledge of the development of digital

exploitation of data and information taking consideration of the current situation of closure of the rectory it is important to highlight significant results in information management which were obtained from the implementation of two investment projects since and whose results per they aim to reflect a clear contrast to the previous situation experienced inside our university as in many organizations information and data management in one it developed in silos that is in a fragmented and cyclical absent from a holistic and systemic perspective the above this was evident in the fact that technological solutions for the management of data and information as well as its supporting guidelines and standards they emerged as responses to particular needs and problems without transversal government guidelines that would guarantee its function nality and integration with other types of technological solutions after the implementation of the two investment projects rela related to phases i and ii of data and information management so with general guidelines in the long medium and short term that have allowed us to gain maturity in the consolidation of data management and integrated information these guidelines are reflected in the policy ethics and the information management model regulatory documents constructed collectively among the relevant actors of the uni

for the consolidation of a language common in the different information systems the standardization of unified rules for data architecture and modeling and the beginning to satisfy the main data needs and information that has been identified in one through the consolidation of an interdisciplinary team managed to carry out an in depth analysis aimed at comp understand the main information and data needs of the university this analysis although it has a fundamental connotation highly investigative has allowed us to obtain a perspective holistic and systemic analysis of the main gaps and deficiencies to be solved tion through the various data management initiatives that they exist and are being built this has been achieved thanks to the close collaboration of functional leaders of the systems mission critical information and high demand processes of data from the university to whom we greatly appreciate your help the main conclusion of this exercise is that it is fundamental for the entire data and information management exercise tion have a clear orientation to the internal and external user whose satisfaction corresponds to our effectiveness additionally results in terms of design can be highlighted of guidelines related to data and information governance tion governing data means learning new behaviors implies advancing on a learning curve as well as that all members of an organizational system act in accordance with a certain set of rules and for particular purposes this changes the behavior of people and organizations so they can think more clearly about care and use of the data thus to implement effective data governance the union must have planning supervision and use tools sedesretni latidity nóicamrofsnart ed ametsisoce of data to maximize the benefit to the organization so it is appropriate to approach data governance as a additional institutional capacity that must be developed and sustained ted in time this has been attempted to be specified from the ela boration of the data governance model which was built or and validated with the participation of the information management cluster and is currently in the validation process at the cned we consider that its implementation should be the fundamental axis for digital transformation in terms of data management and information for which we require the participation and commitment same of the

as conceptual models tual logical physical use cases among others which are oriented document diagram and understand the data life cycle by interior of the university in this exercise it was essential to do a thorough and exhaustive immersion into the databases of the university discovering and evaluating possible data sources that allow us to satisfy the needs of users for identical data tified this has allowed progress in the design and implementation of master and reference data solutions as well as in the related to data integration and interoperability as progress has been made in consolidating initiatives and data and information management solutions needs have arisen ities related to managing organizational change in the university for this within the framework of management

transformation corresponds to the use of data generated by various sources in industrial fields for example to obtain information that allows generating knowledge for subsequent decision making so the data considered as assets digital replicas and systems must have chapter theoretical framework characteristics such as its definition function format time period and relevance to make reports that become valuable information for companies this allows analysis that generates knowledge through analytics functionalities present in the new management systems in order to make decisions that promote innovation in production processes the life cycle of data associated with digital transformation see figure is considers an important aspect in the process of converting big data into information this data life cycle can be classified into three phases emily coyne joshua coyne kenton walker creation the activities of this phase are the first to emerge in the life cycle of the data and prescribe the appropriate way to ensure that the data enter the system are clean and usable needs assessment systematic analysis of the needs of information reports and data of an organization this analysis describes not not only the required information but also the data used to create that information acquisition acquisition of data from internal departments or counterparties external classification involves applying appropriate metadata to each element of data to give clear meaning and context to the data conversion modifying the format of a data element so that it is consistent with the current or expected needs of the information and adapts to existing storage infrastructure ingestion manual or automatic data entry maintenance essential activities to ensure long term access and to discard information that no longer has value these activities are storage selection of appropriate formats media and locations for the data the choice must take into account the type of data being stored and their useful life indexing maps data objects to their location in a set of data to speed up the search update update data stores to ensure the circulation of data and metadata avoiding degradation

organizational transformation the concept of organizational transformation ot has changed even since in where it was associated with second order changes by levy and mery radical changes deep and revolutionary subsequent to this the vision of ot has been considered in a more holistic way by authors such as king guta et al to significantly improve the general performance of the organization in topics such as quality responsiveness cost flexibility among others through planned change later researchers defined organizational transformation as changes fundamental characteristics such as structure process culture and capacity cha cha from there and seeing ot as rapid mini revolutionary and incremental state transitions the term morphing is introduced to describe organizational transformation as changes in a comprehensive continuous and dynamic the continuous transformation attributed to ot includes aspects such as change in the range of products and services offered by the organization as well as the reconfiguration of resources capabilities and structures of o offer changes in control approaches planned by timely experimentation cha cha in cha cha a compilation of some definitions associated with organizational transformation within these the central idea of time and the differences in the conditions of states before and after the change likewise in the definitions

objectives businessdictionary n d according to richard devinney yip johnson the performance organizational comprises three specific result areas financial performance profits return on assets return on investment etc product market performance sales market share etc shareholder return total shareholder return value added economic etc financial performance refers to measurements of operations and policies of an organization in monetary terms for example return on assets return on investment added value among others market performance measures the performance of a company or product in the market that is if market share has increased or if updates to a product allow increased sales shareholder profitability establishes how much an organization enriches its shareholders also it can refer to the market capitalization of an organization in this way organizational performance involves its development strategic planners operations managers financial directors advisors legal businessmen owners of the organization among others in turn whitten kenneth zelbst take as a definition of performance organizational the average market share or share the average volume of sales and average sales growth indicators that reflect the degree to which digital transformation and organizational performance in companies in the healthcare sector electric power the organization performs better than its competitors ashrafi kelleher kuilboer whitten et al in cha cha to evaluate the organizational performance of a company consider the following indicators that determine organizational performance value for money customer retention rate sales growth rate profitability of the company and general competitive position for its part in sklyar kowalkowski tronvoll sörhammar the following criteria to measure organizational performance average return on investment average profit average return on sales average growth of market share average sales volume growth and growth average sales in dollars furthermore richard et al highlights organizational performance as one of the most important constructs in research management and management research related to stakeholders the heterogeneous circumstances of the products and time however this review shows that subjective perceptions related to the definition and various ways are used to its measurement these measures include various financial operation indices such as net earnings after taxes and capital returns and also measures of results in successful experiences it is concluded that there is a lack of clarity of the theoretical definition of organizational performance and a lack of consistency methodological in the formulation of constructs making a scientific comparison difficult effective however organizational performance is not a unidimensional theoretical construct nor is it likely that it can be characterized by a single operational measure therefore the measures of organizational performance can vary according to the domain of research and thus adopt its specific measures by discipline furthermore jenatabadi classify organizational performance into six categories he initially mentions etzioni s concept penley gould which is based on the evaluation of compliance or not with the established objectives other researchers as chandler maintain that the final criterion of organizational performance is its long term growth and survival the improvement is established as a primary objective continuum of organizational performance and it is highlighted that the common definitions are chapter theoretical framework the effectiveness or achievement of the objective in contrast it is suggested to measure performance organizational based on two factors that are adequately adjust the organization and their environments and a good fit between the organization and its individual contributors by therefore the dimension of relevance or customer satisfaction is included in the definition jenatabadi additionally in jenatabadi the definition focused on means and ends is presented of the organization as a social system with resources that can meet the objectives laid out without incapacitating resources and compromising the well being of employees where you can increase the productivity rates satisfaction levels and motivation of your employees collaborators maintaining low turnover rates costs and labor disturbances finally the dimensions of effectiveness in the objectives of the organization efficiency in organizational resources and relevance in stakeholder satisfaction in the definition of organizational performance in addition some activities for performance measurement pm are mentioned which they allow business management to excel through improving motivation monitoring performance improving communication and diagnosing problems furthermore it allows you to identify and formulate improvements in management strategy next some proposed measurements are listed jenatabadi monitoring business progress observe the progress of a company with regarding the achievement of its established objectives through the supervision of the results monitoring the effect of the strategies and the plan through the results tests the impact and possibility of strategies and plans diagnosis based on the analysis of the results where these can show the failure symptoms and encourage the identification of its probable causes support decision making pm allows an organization to search and identify the causes that have led to its success and the potential possibilities that the company can use for further development pm ensures that decisions are made on facts rather than assumptions facilitation of motivation and communication pm indicates the rate of progress of a company and highlights its current and future state of performance the motivation and pm clarity provide the company with an increase in the overall rate of operation

equation modeling in byrne the structural equation model is defined as a methodology statistics that adopts the evaluation of a hypothesis for the analysis of a theory structural related to some phenomenon typically this theory represents processes causals that generate observations in multiple variables in anderson gerbing highlights the potential of structural equation models for development of theories and the validation of constructs in areas such as psychology and social sciences for its part fornell larcker mentions that researchers have begun to demonstrate the advantages of these models with unobserved constructs for estimation of parameters and hypothesis testing in causal models bagozzi yi defines structural equation models as procedures statistics for the measurement of functional predictive and causal tests and hypotheses gunasekaran et al focuses their research on the rbv management commitment and the diffusion of innovation following the adoption of bda initiatives to develop and test a model that explains the impact of bdpa big data and predictive analytics on the supply chain performance and organizational performance they consider the bdpa

connectivity resources and information exchange mediated by the effect of top management commitment tmc top management commitment help the assimilation of bdpa which impacts on supply chain performance and organizational performance for the achievement of competitive advantage see figure chapter theoretical framework figure model proposed in gunasekaran et al on the other hand merendino et al develop a conceptual model using the theory based on knowledge to evaluate the value of bda this research model proves empirically propositions the study evaluates the value chain and begins to see how bda can leverage different forms of knowledge to create agility organizational h h h bda technologies can provide agility organizational through the use of effective knowledge management determining that companies that possess organizational agility can achieve competitive advantage directly ha or indirectly through business processes hb the results obtained through the use of business processes will affect the organization in general h additionally they indicate that agility can also mediate the relationship between knowledge assets and performance ha b c ha b c as shown in figure digital transformation and organizational performance in companies in the healthcare sector electric power figure model proposed by côrte real et al in adrian abdullah atan jusoh a model of the evaluation of implementation of big data analytics and the effect on decision making the model was developed based on three dimensions the organization focused on carrying out a data strategy people through collaborative knowledge workers which refers to the skills of the analytical staff the organizational relationship and the culture analytics and the technological dimension for the execution of data analysis which includes the it infrastructures information processing data governance and data quality management the effect of bdaia big data analytics implementation assessment influences the effectiveness of decision making as well as the indirect effect of realizing the bda strategy the collaborative knowledge worker and the execution of data analysis factors as shown in figure another study of interest is the one presented by mishra luo hazen hassini foropon which proposes a model to examine how it implementation i e the strategic flexibility of it the partnership between companies and big data and predictive analytics bdpa and alignment between companies and bdpa and resource capabilities humans affect organizational performance l through bdpa based on the theory of resource based view chapter theoretical framework figure conceptual model for the evaluation of big business analytics implementation data bdaia taken from adrian et al in the literature bdpa is proposed as a dynamic capability and is put into consideration that the diffusion of bdpa has implications for value creation organizational mishra et al the proposed model takes advantage of the capabilities of information technologies it and human resources to develop the capacity of bdpa which directly affects organizational performance organization performance op as shown in figure figure conceptual model proposed in mishra et al in conclusion structural equation modeling sem as a form of modeling causal variables are commonly used to evaluate unobservable constructs variables latent through a measurement model that defines constructs and establishes relationships between them it is frequently used in the social sciences due to its ability to impute relationships between unobservable constructs digital transformation and organizational performance in companies in the healthcare sector electric power these models develop a hypothesis and implement measurement instruments with questions designed to measure the relationships between constructs according to the initial hypothesis raised resource based theory view rbv the rbv maintains that organizations gain a competitive advantage by creating sets of resources or strategic capabilities rbv focuses on internal resources of the company to identify assets capabilities and competencies with the potential to offer competitive advantages jay b barney ketchen wright rbv is considered a compelling theory in it to theoretically and empirically evaluate the strategic value of organizational resources and establish relationships with business variables this allows you to identify and categorize it resources establish suitable ways to unite and combine various resources and measure the effect of these resources gupta george wade hulland in organizations it is important to ensure that resources are tangible within rbv in general resources can be classified as tangible human abilities and types intangibles tangible resources are financial and physical resources in skills humans bring together knowledge and skills and intangibles are culture organizational and organizational learning gunasekaran et al gupta george merendino et al financial resources include debt equity retained earnings etc the resources physical include machines manufacturing facilities buildings human resources include the experience knowledge judgment risk management and expertise of the professionals l organizational resources include history politics structure values relationships control and management system compensation policies and culture organizational gunasekaran et al gupta george merendino et al for its part according to größler grübner resources can be discriminated in physical capital human capitalchapter theoretical framework technological capital reputation capital furthermore it is considered that these can be tangible such as infrastructure or intangibles such as the action of sharing information or knowledge likewise it associates better performance of an organization with the possession of valuable rare imperfectly imitable and resources with adequate organization amit schoemaker jay b barney et al merendino et al thus the tangible resources and intangibles must be valuable rare inimitable and non substitutable so that it can generate a competitive advantage erevelles fukawa swayne gunasekaran et al gupta george wade hulland studies seek to identify resources that will enable organizations to build bda capabilities and improve business performance organization gunasekaran et al gupta george knowledge based theory based view theory kbv kbv theory states that an organization s knowledge resources are unique and inimitable and that the main function of the organization is to take advantage of them to obtain productive results côrte real et al this knowledge is integrated and adopted based on organizational culture organizational policy and strategy improvement processes continuous and traceability of procedures ict systems and employee roles kodama the kbv theory considers that the types of capabilities must be differentiated based on knowledge especially for the use of ict or big data kodama the companies that have high levels of staff knowledge and participation can more skillfully identify the need for resource change management existing and decide on the actions necessary to implement these changes côrte real et al the two main types of knowledge in the organization are explicit knowledge and the unspoken explicit knowledge can be expressed and identified within routines traceability processes and organizational technologies côrte real et al this specific knowledge of trends in the industry sector to which the company belongs organization digital transformation and organizational performance in companies in the healthcare sector electric power with tacit knowledge a competitive advantage can be obtained from the capabilities of professionals or specific to the organization to respond to changes in the market structure or changes in regulations professionals develop knowledge i quote by action and experience this operates on a subconscious level and is difficult to articulate and disseminate in the organization kodama the implementation of digital transformation technologies requires a management system of knowledge with an open approach to foster knowledge flows this improves the development of internal knowledge management capacity and increases the innovation capacity of the company santoro vrontis thrassou dezi this capacity refers to the ability of an organization to explore and retain the internal and external knowledge within its own ecosystem with a focus on open innovation that allows the creation of new products and processes the management of knowledge identifies and leverages knowledge to foster processes of innovation where functional and motivational factors are relevant to its success santoro fiano bertoldi ciampi theory of dynamic capabilities dynamic capability theory dc the concept of dynamic capabilities was originally used by teece pisano and shuen in which they defined as organization s ability to integrate build and reconfigure internal and external competencies to quickly address environments changing pisano teece shuen teece gary shuen amy for their part eisenhardt martin they relate the importance of capabilities dynamics in the adequate and timely adaptation to the changing environment through reconfiguration of processes and resources both internal and external reconfiguration given from existing competencies considering data as an asset the capabilities in big data routines processes and analysis and knowledge management from these data rialti et al this reconfiguration of processes and resources is can occur in a planned way through change management processes based on the existing knowledge to generate a competitive advantage rialti et al chapter theoretical framework makadok defines capabilities as subsets of a company s resources that are not transferred the objective of which is to improve the productivity of other resources are capacities depend on the operating conditions of each organization the theory of dynamic capabilities arises from the perspective based on rbv and kbv as an effective theory for the field of strategic management for business and management of ict this theory maintains that dynamic capabilities allow companies modify your resources to adapt quickly to changing conditions and maintain its competitive advantage rialti et al dc is made up of the ability to detect and configure opportunities and threats and maintain competitiveness through improvement combination protection and reconfiguration of tangible and intangible assets teece proposes dc to face new challenges such as the ability ity of employees to learn and build new assets integrate strategic assets including capacity technology and customer requirements in processes and the transformation or reuse of existing assets furthermore it is defined agility as a dynamic capability where companies can identify and respond to threats and opportunities and quickly adjust their behaviors côrte real et al in mihardjo sasmoko alamsyah elidjen the dynamic ability seen by helfat peteraf and schoemaker as an improvement in vision resource based addressing problems with the routine process in terms of resources processes products and services that the organization needs to adapt in conclusion in this chapter the conceptual framework of the themes was developed related to digital transformation and organizational performance in order to have a starting point for building the model in this review of concepts evidences a close relationship between data the life cycle associated with transformation digital and the process of converting big data into information therefore it is considered the big data theory as one of the fundamental elements of digital transformation organizational transformation is presented under the ideas of fundamental change productivity discontinuous changes broad changes in the organizational entity and unexpected transitions proposals related to performance are presented organizational structure of companies through real and measured results regarding planned goals and objectives digital transformation and organizational performance in companies in the healthcare sector electric power in mes cases from the literature are presented that serve as input for the construction of the proposed model it is evident that the models found analyze simple relationships between a few variables and the need to formulate a model that includes more variables which in turn integrate more elements inside in order to generate a more complex model than those studied in the literature review the most recurrent definitions of resource based theories are presented knowledge and dynamic capabilities allowing us to highlight that the models considered integrate these theories into their conceptual proposals furthermore you can conclude that the proposed model must be heterogeneous and include elements that associate the three theories and methodologies chapter systematic review of literature rsl this chapter aims to systematize the literature on digital transformation and organizational performance as a methodology a bibliometric analysis was carried out and a review of the literature in articles extracted from the databases scopus web of science wos and ieee xplore digital library search equations criteria inclusion and exclusion the objective of the search eda is to identify theories methodologies strategies models and fundamental elements of organizational transformation necessary to take advantage maximizing the digital transformation of energy companies through rsl from of the keywords

blockchain and organizational transformation or organizational change or organizational capability equation this search equation is supported by the review in the tree of science application tos showing how fundamental publications in organizational changes and big data to mcafee brynjolfsson and h chen chiang storey from there case studies and theoretical models are derived to evaluate the influence of digital transformation in organizational performance search equation included the following exclusion criteria for the search in the databases inclusion criteria consider bibliographic references consistent with the theme that presents case studies organizational transformation models studies based on surveys statistical analysis and rsl i also know consider quantitative and qualitative case studies and transformation models organizational additionally specific areas of the themes are included search object such as computer science business management economy among others exclusion criteria references of only ict or transformation are not considered organizational only and reflection publications areas thatchapter systematic literature review are excluded are not considered relevant to the search as they are far from the field study therefore with the application of equation d e search adapted for each base of data the result is the number of articles presented in table table number of articles resulting from the application of the search equation for each database in total relevant publications were obtained by applying the criteria of inclusion exclusion and elimination of repeated publication initially found for each of the databases consulted an analysis is carried out about of the number of documents published per year country and by area where the information analyzed in scopus it is evident that the greatest increase in publications related with the present field of study was presented in see figure digital transformation and organizational performance in companies in the information sector electric power figure number of documents published per year of the total publications the majority were made in the united states followed by germany in terms of publications made by specific areas it is found that the the highest percentage of published documents is in the area of life sciences computing with followed by business and management with see figure figure number of documents published by area from the scopus database it is possible to access documents for reading the other articles found are accessed through payment chapter systematic review of literature in ieee it is identified that the articles found have recurrence in the following topics systems and information management in organizations so likewise the largest proportion of publications related to the field the study in question was presented in the articles found in the wos database have as areas of common publication management and business management in wos it is evident that the largest number of publications related to the this field of study was presented starting in maintaining the average of publications for the years and see figure figure number of documents published per year in the wos database in terms of research areas the most highlights are business economies information and technology sciences computing according to the search equation articles were obtained of which which were found in the scopus database therefore they select the remaining articles for review from the web of science database it is possible to access documents for reading map of search equations below are maps based on network data from the publications scientific findings found in the search equation using the software tool vosviewer van eck waltman in order to visualize the networks formed by keywords and authors of the selected articles onados digital transformation and organizational performance in companies in the healthcare sector electric power the elements in the networks presented are connected by co authorship and by co occurrence of keywords in order to analyze bibliometric networks rialti et al van eck waltman maps based on presented data show the network as a set of elements along with the links between these the strength of the links can indicate the number of cited references that two publications have in common in the case of links from bibliographic coupling the number of publications that two researchers have been co authors in the case of co authorship links or the number of publications in which two terms appear together in the case of match links the items are grouped in clusters by attributes such as the weight of each element which are displayed in the map in the visualization items with a higher weight are displayed more prominently than elements with a lower weight indicating the importance of the elements of each cluster below are the maps made taking into account all the occurrences of a term in a document therefore it corresponds to the complete count of the terms in the articles examined full counting scopus keyword co occurrence based on data information bibliographic data of the articles found in the search equation the map is created occurrence of keywords the grouping of clusters associated with organizational change industry and its close relationship with information management within the same cluster information systems and business intelligence and one of the most relevant relationships in cluster those related to big data and transformation organizational see figure for the co occurrence of keywords the following parameters were established minimum number of occurrences of a keyword of keywords reach the threshold for each of the keywords the total link strength will be calculated matching with other keywords the keywords with the highest total bond strength number of keywords to select chapter systematic literature review figure clusters by keyword in scopus the resulting map shows the grouping of clusters organized as follows manner terms extracted from title and abstract based on the bibliographic information obtained from the search equation the map of the terms extracted from the title and summary of the articles under study in this the presence of clusters is evident where organization is the term that groups the most articles followed by data which form a cluster with terms such as big data and digital transformation and organizational performance in companies of the sector of electric power knowledge cluster groups the terms change strategy and transformation digital industry while cluster brings together those related to the organization and the cases of big data analytics see figure the following requirements are determined to create the map of terms extracted from the titles and summary of the articles analyzed minimum number of occurrences of a term of terms reach the threshold for each of the terms a relevance score will be calculated function from this score the most relevant terms will be selected the default option is to select the most relevant terms number of terms to select figure clusters by terms extracted from title and abstract in scopus the resulting map shows the grouping of clusters organized as follows way chapter systematic literature review web of science wos keyword co occurrence taking into account all occurrences of keywords in a document and their counting in the examined articles the keyword occurrence map is made for articles in the wos database figure shows the formation of clusters related to big data and intelligence of business information technologies and company performance the co occurrence of all keywords under the following parameters minimum number of occurrences of a keyword of keywords meet the threshold for for each of the keywords the total strength of the matching links is calculated with other keywords keywords with the highest link strength are selected total number of keywords to select among the results obtained in the map of figure shows the presence of the terms performance and firm performance in different clusters red and green respectively it is clarified that said separation is due to the fact that the performance of the red cluster refers to the performance of the technologies associated with big data while the term performance firm of the green cluster refers to the overall performance of the organization additionally a direct relationship is evident between big data and dynamic capabilities which presents a greater total force than the direct relationship between big data and the theory of resource based view this allows us to conclude that the relationship between big data and dynamic capabilities is considered relevant to link technological aspects with the performance of organizations digital transformation and organizational performance in companies in the healthcare sector electric power figure clusters by keywords in wos the resulting map shows the grouping of clusters organized as follows manner terms extracted from title and abstract taking as reference the base from wos data the map of occurrences is made of the terms extracted from the title and summary of the selected articles evidencingchapter systematic literature review the relationship between terms through the grouping of clusters highlighting the appearance of the terms of big data and capability in the formation of cluster additionally shows the preponderance of the industry and innovation terms of cluster as well as as system and business intelligence of cluster and the terms of big data analytics and its adoption present in cluster see figure to prepare the map of occurrence of terms extracted from the title and abstract a minimum number was taken into account of occurrences of a term out of of terms reach the threshold for each one of the terms a relevance score will be calculated based on this score the most relevant terms will be selected the default option is select the most relevant terms number of terms to select figure clusters by terms extracted from title and abstract in wos the clusters present in the term occurrence map are grouped as follows way digital transformation and organizational performance in companies in the healthcare sector electric power finally it is decided to take the map based on the database as the conclusive map of wos because it brings together the vast majority of articles used in the present study and groups the clusters in a better way furthermore it accurately represents the relationship direct connection between big data as part of digital transformation and organizational performance as shown in figure figure clusters by keywords emphasis on the relationship between big data and performance organizational the bibliometric analysis revealed three clusters of documents on digital transformation and organizational performance the first related to big data and business intelligence chapter systematic literature review the second about organizational performance focused on the company s results firm performance competitive advantages and dynamic capabilities the third in information technologies management systems and impact cluster includes publications related to technology performance science of data information and knowledge management cluster groups publications on the specific aspects of organizations such as competitive advantages and analysis of data that makes possible the connection with the other clusters as well as the inclusion of methodologies such as dynamic capabilities and resource based vision lastly the cluster integrates the management systems that generate an impact on the performance of the organization in figure emphasis is placed on organizational performance of which its direct relationship with big data and its articulation with the cluster of systems information technologies and management figure clusters by keywords emphasis on the relationship between big data and performance organizational grouped by year finally figure presents the clusters discriminated by year of publication where it is possible to identify that the majority of the publications were made in in topics on data analytics competitive advantages and business intelligence followed digital transformation and organizational performance in companies in the healthcare sector electric power by those on dynamic capabilities technologies and their performance between and it is evident that the oldest publications year are related to the impact on organizations associated with the use of information technologies and big data theories the systematic review of the literature includes the description and advances in three theories different related to organizational performance and its relationship with transformation digital these include dynamic capabilities dc in order to find competitive advantages dc such as organizational agility is considered essential in gunasekaran et al a conceptual model is proposed based on a perspective based on knowledge and capability theories dynamics the model evaluates the value chain through prepositions bda used to leverage different forms of knowledge in order to create organizational agility h h h bda to provide organizational agility to the company through the use of a effective knowledge management companies that have this type of capacity dynamics can achieve competitive advantage directly ha or indirectly through business processes hb the results obtained through the use of business processes will affect the general organization h agility can mediate the relationship between knowledge assets and performance ha b c ha b c contributions to the improvement are presented in braganza brooks nepelski ali moro of the organization s resource management through establishing a process archetype commercial for big data initiatives directing attention to creating a capacity dynamics with such initiatives and identifying the drawbacks of rbt theory in the big data context the three approaches related to the theory based on resources the knowledge based vision of organizations and the capabilities dynamics the latter seen as the ways in which organizations shape andchapter systematic literature review continually reconfigure processes to achieve beneficial results braganza et al dynamic capabilities suggest ways in which organizations that wish to exploit big data they reconfigure resources to make these initiatives events i repeated ible and sustainable rather than isolated events reconfiguration and transformation effective require an ability to detect relevant changes constant monitoring of markets and technologies readiness to adopt best practices and evaluation comparative the more frequently an organization reconfigures and transforms its capabilities the the greater the probability of achieving competitive advantages braganza et al for their part eisenhardt and martin suggest that in organizations dynamic capabilities are simple experimental and iterative in contrast to more stable markets where they are complex analytical and linear eisenhardt martin argote concludes that organizations face difficulties when leaders use existing knowledge to generalize from past experiences in this sense zollo winter on page propose the capabilities dynamics arise from the coevolution of processes of accumulation of tacit experience with explicit activities of articulation and codification of knowledge the development of dynamic capabilities invoke mechanisms that go beyond the tacit accumulation of experience implicit knowledge is articulated through collective discussion sessions information and performance evaluation processes braganza et al hill jones mentions that some dynamic capabilities include processes of product development resource allocation and knowledge creation processes these processes allow the creation of collaboration networks between internal and external relationships that generate combinations of resources to meet or exceed customer expectations stakeholders hill jones organizations combine skills data technologies and experience to create products and services that generate income greater efficiency and generally greater competitive advantages braganza et al in braganza et al it is shown that big data processes must change dynamically in response to external and internal influences of organizations presenting in their study bases to map the ways in which organizations digital transformation and organizational performance in companies in the information sector electric power adapt and transform their capabilities based on the strategic knowledge they obtained from big data initiatives additionally braganza et al concludes that the relationship between big data and dynamic capabilities are important because big data processes must transform over time as organizations reconfigure or develop new capabilities to achieve results from the knowledge acquired in big data dynamic capabilities can be considered to represent an appropriate approach to study the effect of information systems and big data the bda can be used in different places uations and can provide a competitive advantage over the market changing and high global competitiveness bda capabilities are a set of capabilities that can help an organization adapt a resource base existing to address different information needs that support decision making decision rialti et al bda progressively influences the competitiveness of organizations their performance organizational and financial from generating organizational capacity to identify and take advantage of new opportunities seek collaborations and strategic partners improve the knowledge flow and facilitate knowledge sharing mcafee brynjolfsson merendino et al rialti et al however these positive effects of big data are derived from the organizational decision to implement them establish strategies change management and dynamic capabilities to leverage data in the organization managers have the ability to make decisions appropriate strategies according with the available information on internal processes and operations supply performance of professionals and behavioral patterns of users rialti et al therefore bda is a resource with multiple use potential to solve various issues to achieve these solutions routines processes and capabilities are required to convert said data into meaningful information côrte real et al where the experience of analysts and managers can increase their analysis efficiency this analysis big data can generate enormous flows of knowledge that must be channeled into a data management process rialti et al based on the knowledge generated with bigchapter systematic literature review data it is important to pay attention to the impact of data on decision making processes decisions and organizational performance rialti et al in conclusion bda can generate knowledge and change the way managers they think and act based on an adequate information management system this requires ensure that managers receive the correct information when making decisions to improve performance respond to sudden changes or identify new models business emerging opportunity and consequently decide the best path to follow for the organization rialti et al resource based view rbv in gunasekaran et al the assimilation of big data and analysis is conceptualized predictive bdpa big data and predictive analytics in the chain supply and organizational performance as a three stage process acceptance routinization and assimilation from the resource based perspective the influence of resources is identified connectivity and information exchange in organizational performance concludes ing that resources under the mediation effect of top management commitment in the assimilation of big data supply chain and organizational performance positively relate to the acceptance of bdpa on the other hand connectivity and information exchange under the mediation effect of commitment of senior management improves acceptance of the use of big data analytics and prediction improves performance and business processes measured through the theoretical rbv and through online surveys of company managers gunasekaran et al senior management must be able to acquire it resources invest in them to generate bda capabilities and commit to the process to achieve improved performance of the organization gunasekaran et al also the importance of evaluate through rbv the impact of big data on marketing activities from the process of collecting consumer activities the process of extracting information and the use of consumer knowledge to improve dynamic and adaptive capabilities of the organization erevelles et al in braganza et al some limitations are identified in the theory based on resources in the context of big data initiatives given that the implementation was carried out thinking about the management of organizational resources and it is argued that big data nullifies digital transformation and organizational performance in companies in the information sector electric power many of the assumptions of resource based theory to achieve an advantage competitive such as for example open access to data so that consent can be proven or questioned popper data that is often not possible to access due to confidentiality issues data is considered one of the critical resources in big data and theory based on resources introduced in _wos provides a framework called vrin value rarity imperfect imitability and non substitutability including property of the resources and their attributes to consider strategic resources in order to provide a deeper understanding of the strategic actions of organizations j b barney suggests that strategic resources have four attributes value rarity imperfect imitability and non substitutability and identifies that they generate sources of competitive advantage thus conner suggests that the degree of heterogeneity of resources influences the potential for competitive advantage proposing that the attributes of value and rarity confers a competitive advantage while inimitability and non substitutability along with the other two confer sustainability conner for other part citing hofer and schendel and grant the following classification is suggested of types of resources grant hofer schendel financial resources physical resources human resources re organizational courses quality control systems corporate culture relations technological capabilities intangible resources e g reputation brand recognition goodwill willpower in the realm of big data physical capital resources include platforms for collecting and store large amounts volume of truthful data that continuously flows into real time velocity from many different sources variety and big data analytics human capital resources include information from data scientists and strategies to capture valid data manage and extract information capital resources include an organizational structure that allows the company to transform data into knowledge and being able to use it in decision making and concrete actions erevelles etchapter systematic review of the literature al the structure of the organization is what is responsible for defining the allocation of tasks processes and procedures levels of hierarchy formal mechanisms of coordination and interaction patterns valentin therefore to generate a competitive advantage with resources it is required that leaders develop capabilities structure resources to use in processes methodologies of acquiring and implementing big data analytics in the business gunasekaran et al capabilities are a necessity for the organization and depend on its context because these are a subset of the resources that are not transferable and have as objective to improve the productivity of other resources erevelles et al gunasekaran et al according to the above in a digital organization leaders must ensure their strategic priorities cultural values organizational norms and ensure transmit them to your collaborators thus human aspects such as charisma motivation adaptation and the ability to be facilitators become the most important characteristics in leaders of digital organizations cianni mary and steven steckler these responsive leaders must facilitate the design execution of actions and be open to employee initiatives allowing criticism and feedback are tools that strengthen them dery sebastian van der meulen in conclusion sustainable leadership focused on the employee experience with systemic learning mechanisms and strategies linked to the vision of the organization simplify work life and instill innovative leadership based behaviors shared dery et al on the other hand the organizational culture is based on the values behavior member relationships power relations and existing competencies that can trigger a culture of achievement based on the expected results or culture of support for personal motivation valentin b roasted in knowledge kbv knowledge based view the impact of bda on the value chain is examined in côrte real et al entrepreneurship in a european context by empirically testing a new theoretical framework that combines strategic management theories kbv and dc theory research is presented that evaluate how bda can add value to the organization s performance digital transformation and organizational performance in companies in the healthcare sector electric power establishing links between knowledge assets organizational agility and in productivity the main result of the study is the understanding of the bda value chain through a model based on the kbv and dc theories it is possible to perceive the assets of knowledge and the impacts on process performance and competitive advantage of bda initiatives in european companies and presents the following conclusions of the study côrte real et al bda can be a strategic investment for european companies to improve organizational agility and surviving in competitive markets to create agility european companies tend to believe that knowledge external derived from bda applications may be more effective in creating agility than internal knowledge bda initiatives can lead to improved operational efficiency with that several paths can lead to competitive advantage mediating the effects of knowledge assets about performance the knowledge management presented in braganza et al suggests that large data can provide deeper understanding for strategic action the organizations camison and fores develop four dimensions of knowledge acquisition assimilation transformation and application camisón forés according to filippini güttel and nosella knowledge management initiatives they are characterized by filippini güttel nosella a set of methods formal descriptions of objectives and tasks roles social structures and policies resources human resources time and infrastructure organizational routines that allow exploratory or exploitative learning for their part donate and de pablo highlight the importance of leadership oriented to the knowledge in the management initiatives of organizations donate de pablo studying the effects of leadership on the abilities of organizations to explore and exploit knowledge in other studies such as that of rollins bellenger and johnston concludes that organizations do not usually adopt approaches long term planning for decision making rollins bellenger johnston chapter systematic literature review knowledge management is required to strengthen the mechanisms that facilitate it such as coding ent exchange re individuals and teams the stimulation of creation exchange and protection of knowledge additionally you must provide the necessary infrastructure and strengthen the structured coordination processes of the knowledge management effectively in this way knowledge management facilitates the creation of open and collaborative ecosystems the exploitation of flows of knowledge and increases the capacity for innovation santoro vrontis et al the integration between administrative management based on digital technology and management of the knowledge allows organizations to make decisions focused on their objectives strategic and preserve knowledge as the most important asset of the company galvez martinez casteneda cuellar tarazona bermudez the management of knowledge must tend to present and use information in a timely manner guaranteeing the availability consistency and quality of the data galvez martinez et al organizational change management digital transformations of companies require changes in processes functions and way of doing things organizational changes are determined by internal and external factors the internal changes refer to a new strategy organizational changes in the composition of professionals new teams or changes in the attitude of employees external changes are changes in needs and consumer desires new government laws new technologies or economic changes valentin globalization ict and sustainability generate a more dynamic competitive environment for organizations which requires assuming the challenges of generating profits and develop capacity in organizations to generate sustained differentiating value in time this requires harmonizing the vision organizational structure and culture the processes and functions to allow management decisions to be made with differential value sandoval duque organizations must understand the meaning of the concept of change management to prepare and dynamically change the strategy structure culture and operation of the process from understanding the forces that drive or stop change resistance digital transformation and organizational performance in companies in the healthcare sector electric power to change the speed of change the attitude of people towards changes organizational and opportunity depending on the organization s environment buono kerber sandoval duque organizational change must assume the needs of competitive circumstances of the environment through the capacity for adaptive transformation sandoval duque external causes of change can be found such as new trends in markets globalization new consumers technological innovations new competitors new lifestyles sustainability or organizational and environmental use of ict digital transformation with big data and industrial revolution sandoval duque causes internals motivate change such as management s new vision of the future changes in structure or processes new competitive strategies mergers or alliances sandoval duke therefore organizations must be clear about the reason for the desired change and the factors that drive them along with the expected results to be able to plan the organizational transformation actions sandoval duque these changes can be superficial as small and continuous changes in strategies structures processes physical transformations with the advantages of being easy to apply fast and with limited costs or profound changes that generate a high impact on the organization on the culture practices vision strategies structure and planning involving areas and associated risks sandoval duque the perspective of change management and decision making in the organization to determine the actions to follow depend on the type of change to be made the planned change allows make decisions in advance reorient your strategies and define a road map with goals change by inertia simply follows a managerial trend taking a external action model to achieve own objectives in the change by reaction of decisions to make adjustments after having a difficulty or problem and seek correct it finally change due to crisis occurs in survival situations with high levels of tension and unwanted consequences sandoval duque successful organizational change processes can begin with the definition of principles about change due to its heterogeneity and complexity such as the principle holistic that integrates actions on all components of the organization strategies structure teams services products and others or its philosophy values culturechapter systematic literature review organizational motivation the breaking principle is used when change requires get rid of paradigms that generate balance in organizations and change generates instability while transformation is achieved the principle of constancy seeks conserve effort to maintain the spirit energy and willingness to change he principle of non preference as the universality of the change process and the linking of the people who affect the process the indeterminacy principle explains processes dynamic and complex changes with unpredictable elements sandoval duque models for managing organizational changes provide elements to facilitate the decision making which manage to generate value in change processes such as the three steps of unfreezing changing and refreezing carried out by kurt lewin montúfar sandoval duque the change model e kurt lewin is based on the evaluation of the behavior of driving forces of change and the restrictive forces that prevent it and preserve the status quo quo montúfar the steps of kurt lewin s model begin with defrosting that seeks to reduce the forces that maintain the organization at its current level of behavior continues with the change or movement where one seeks to move towards new behavioral patterns and habits of the organization with new values habits behaviors and attitudes and finally the refreezing where the organization in a new state of balance based on culture norms policies and organizational structure bustos martínez carrasco sagredo bull montúfar regardless of the change management model organizational transformation and action planning can be based on the organization s strategic plans towards the three levels of organization likewise transformations can occur of groups and individuals where the planned procedures materialize through adjustments to the

of the literature shows a research topic incipient and require attention to the factors that promote or hinder the digital transformation in organizations it is identified that the greatest amount of documents about the study topics were made starting in thus it is evident that the topic under study between digital transformation and performance organizational is current however there are no authorships that remain with time which suggests varied productivity and is not too specific on the topic under study the oldest publications year are related to the impact on the organizations associated with the use of information technologies and big data regarding the relationship between the variables of the equation maps a link is evident direct between big data and organizational performance additionally it presents recurrently the formation of clusters around big data changes organizational and performance strategy and business intelligence systems and technology and information management chapter methodology the methodologies used to evaluate conceptual models are described below that relate the constructs and hypotheses proposed in the model to evaluate the effect on organizational performance due to the implementation and use of digital technologies methodologies in gunasekaran et al the resource based vision theory is used to conceptualize bdpa assimilation as a capacity that impacts the supply chain supply and organizational performance with the help of connectivity resources and exchange of information under the mediation of senior management commitment the method used is through a five point likert scale survey approach from strongly disagree to strongly agree which were put tested by a group of experienced researchers later nte taking into account taking into account the suggested adjustments the questionnaire was sent via email to consultants and supply chain managers to review structure readability ambiguity and integrity to have a modified final instrument based on comments as a result the assimilation of bdpa is conceptualized as a process that involves acceptance routinization and assimilation considering the impact of resources connectivity and exchange of information and capabilities ability to assimilate big data in scp and op this supports the argument that if the resources are mediated by the commitment of senior management it is possible to achieve acceptance of bdpa first step to achieve assimilation with this study it is considered that the rbv theory is important to understand assimilation of bdpa as a capability that depends on the pooling of resources connectivity and exchange of information and with which positive impacts are obtained in the chain of supply organizational performance and thereby achieve a competitive advantage business chapter systematic literature review for its part the model proposed in côrte real et al and the validation of the hypotheses that evaluate the entire supply chain are tested through a survey in several countries of european organizations the study uses a survey instrument based on a review of the literature and validation of the content scope and purpose of the made by academic researchers and language experts subsequently a pilot study with executives from different companies to the application group of the main survey in order to make modifications to the final instrument eliminating ambiguities and simplifying interpretation experiments and validation within the proposed models validations are presented in côrte real et al empirical through surveys directed at european companies and their executives it businesses where it is evident that bda can provide commercial value in various stages of the companies value chain creating organizational agility through through knowledge management and its impact on processes and benefits competitive demonstrating in turn that agility can partially mediate the effect between knowledge assets and performance process level and advantage competitive for its part in order to prove that data driven companies would have better results in terms of business performance in mcafee brynjolfsson mentions the application of structured interviews with executives from companies north american publics about their organizational and management practices technology collecting performance data from annual reports and sources independent from the results obtained it stands out that the companies that characterized by their da cough performed better on objective measures in terms financial and operational the study highlights the challenge of using big data in the field management which leads to a new decision making culture and new roles mcafee brynjolfsson in turn five management challenges are identified within of the change process to obtain the benefits of a transition to the use of big data that are leadership teams that establish clear objectives define what success looks like and ask the right questions digital transformation and organizational performance in companies in the healthcare sector electric power talent management data scientists and other professionals who are experts in working with large amounts of information technology tools to analyze data and integration of all sources of relevant internal and external data decision making positioning of information and rights of relevant decision in the same location company culture decisions based on data which tend to be better decisions combining domain experience with data science on the other hand the survey carried out to validate the model presented in côrte real et al an online tool was created in respondent profiles were created according to knowledge and expertise as follows deep knowledge of the organization s strategy more than five years of experience in bda initiatives hold an it business executive management position in the company an email is sent to apply the survey to executives of european companies emails taken from the database of dun bradstreet one of the world leading firms in commercial information and business vision the method is used of partial least squares pls to estimate the proposed conceptual model and examine the validity of the constructs the results support the claim that the bda applications can enable effective knowledge management so that companies create organizational agility côrte real et al the agility contemplated in the study is presented in the following ways côrte real et al detecting opportunities and threats for example reacting to new products or competitive services taking advantage of possible opportunities for example expanding into new regional or international markets adjusting to the technological environment to achieve competitive advantage e g adopting new technologies to produce more products and services efficiently in gunasekaran et al the validation of the proposed model is done through a three stage improvement cycle to develop measures that satisfy all requirementschapter systematic literature review of reliability validity and unidimensionality i j chen paulraj they used so much alpha composite reliability scr as the cronbach scale fornell larcker henseler ringle sinkovics the commonly used method fornell larcker was used to calculate the validity convergent and discriminant with criteria of shared average variance less than and values of the square root of the average variance extracted ave for each construct realized greater than any correlation estimate additionally they were considered several fit indices for each construct from the analysis unidimensionality was obtained of the general fit of the model and discriminant validity chapter design and practice implementation experimental next the proposal for an experimental practice to evaluate the taking is presented of decisions by professionals from companies in the electric energy sector in order to determine the influence of the information provided for decision making as support for the organizational performance of companies the implementation of the experiment aims to establish the relationship between information and decision making to subsequently link digital transformation with organizational performance through of a model of structured equations that allows us to show the direct relationships and indirect between the associated variables the design of the experiment is proposed contemplating a scenario with information and another without this is for decision making allowing you to evaluate the contribution of digital transformation in companies through information and data based evidence for making of decisions in the execution of energy projects the experiment is carried out using as a foundation the theory of experimental economics which applies methods to study the interaction of human beings in social contexts governed by rules explicit or implicit fatás juberías roig cotanda design and implementation the design of the experiment is based on the following hypothesis which we wish to validate does having more information actually help us make better decisions wanted provide a solution to the hypothesis raised through the fulfillment of the following objectives when running the experiment establish the relationship between intuition versus evidence obtained through real data from organizational processes in decision making chapter design and implementation of experimental practice identify the importance of data around decision making taking into account realize that technology provides enormous amounts of data in information that it may be a function of decision making the design was developed according to the flow diagram presented in the digital transformation and organizational performance in companies in the healthcare sector electric power figure flowchart of the design and application of the experiment for him the experiment took into account considerations in terms of environment endowment application preferences and methodology described below around for the application of the experiment two events of relevant importance are attended in the electrical sector carried out in november and december these events bring together a significant number of professionals with the appropriate profile for the application of the experiment including engineers knowledgeable in the electrical sector heads of production areas engineers responsible for projects and general staff with decision making power the events where the experiment took place were regional smart grids workshop cali november fise ieee cigre conference december to plaza mayor de conventions medellín colombia for the application of the experiment the following equipment was available chapter design and implementation of experimental practice infrastructure hall auditorium with availability for people suitable for participants with tables chairs equipment etc computer equipment with internet access audio and projection equipment microphone it was considered sufficient to have computers with internet access for the application of the experiment logistics attendee registration area coffee area material slide presentation with the explanation of the experiment experimental economy sheets and pens to include recommendations to the survey applied regarding the preferences for the application of the experiment the following were considered following application of the experiment through an online survey in order to to optimize times in the analysis of the results obtained the survey is applied to professionals with some decision making power in the organizations to which they belong the above given that it seeks to establish the relationship between decision making and intuition versus decision making with evidence given by the information of the organization s processes in relation to the nature of the payments of the experiment a box was delivered of chocolates valued at usd to each participant delivered at the end of the execution of the activity experiment design surveys were conducted aimed at organizations in the electricity sector in colombia for through the participation of its business executives with tactical decision making power and strategic the surveys were designed on the google forms online platform and were applied in the aforementioned events during the session a context presentation of the experiment is made indicating the objective and establishing the basic rules for the application of the experiment it was used an execution time of minutes for each of the two days besides the survey specified instructions specifying the application procedure additionally each session was accompanied by support professionals for the resolution of concerns digital transformation and organizational performance in companies in the healthcare sector electric power in the instrument survey scenarios were presented so that according to the given conditions the decision making of each professional will be carried out tending to analyze subsequently whether or not the participant used the information provided for each scenery the context corresponds to a daily situation in the electrical sector that requires the taking of decision the first scenario considers the context given without information that is that the context is presented and the participant is sought to make the decision based on the interaction of your intuition your prior knowledge experience emotions and sensations product of working under pressure for its part the second scenario includes relevant information about the organization and inputs that come from assumed data in order to obtain a decision making based on the use of the information present before applying the final survey a validation pilot application is carried out with the in order to make modifications to the final instrument eliminating ambiguities and simplifying interpretation validating content scope and purpose the pilot is applied to master s students from the faculty of sciences of the national university of colombia which provided feedback on the design of the proposed instrument giving as result of the survey finally applied the experiment allows the participants to be divided into three groups a b and c in order to deliver different criteria and statements for decision making of the following way group a the decision making context is provided and no criteria or statements additional group b the decision making context and supporting criteria are provided related to economic aspects of the solution group c the decision making context and supporting criteria are provided related to social experimental economic regulatory and technological at the beginning of the experiment each participant is assigned a group for analysis purposes resulting information the survey is divided into sections the first includes information general related to personal educational and employment data the second with the content of the decision context and the supporting criteria statements for each group chapter design and implementation of experimental practice the last one compiles all the criteria and supporting statements for decision making and is asks all participants regardless of the group to which they have been linked to select those that were taken into account when making the decision execution or not of the project the detail of the applied instrument and its sections is presented in annex a analysis of results the pr procedures for executing the experiment which are standardized with the proposed environment included the definition of step by step explanation of the experiment data collection this was done online storage data and results were saved online additional information generated automatically by the online google forms tool data treatment through tables and graphs that best represent way the results obtained debugging erroneous data and responses to decision making are excluded without justification payments were made once the session ended data verification considered the most important part of the process for the refined data is then graphed so that the experimenter can visually detect points that may indicate erroneous data if these data are distorted in some way the experimenter reviews the method used to the analysis of the cleaned data or cites the findings faithfully below are the results obtained for each group of the experiment assigned group the group assignment was done so that there was an equal proportion for each group therefore it was achieved that the distribution was on average the distribution is presented in figure figure assignment of groups to participants digital transformation and organizational performance in companies in the healthcare sector electric power where group a corresponds to the participants who did not have information or specific criteria for project decision making group b for those who had some type of partial information and group c to those who had the totality of information provided for decision making the project decision making for each group is presented in figure can show that all participants in group a who did not have information opted for the execution of the project which allows us to conclude that the decision was made based on the previous conceptions of each participant now for groups b and c which had information the participants had an approximate percentage of non approval of the execution of the project in question this may be related to the specific information they took into account with criteria that do not justify the viability of the project and this shows the use of information provided for decision making figure decision making for each group of the experimentchapter design and implementation of experimental practice decision making criteria this section provided all the criteria provided to group c plus some additional ones in order for all the participants in the experiment to select the criteria or statements that were taken into account when making the decision on the execution or not of the pr proposed project from the responses obtained it can be concluded that the criteria and statements that were taken into account by the participants when making the decision making in greater proportion are economic aspect cost benefit analysis for the city of implementation with regulatory aspect law of with aspects associated with technology autonomy of electric vehicles evs vs average end user journeys with the criteria that had a participation between and are the following economic aspects of the technology decrease in battery cost regulatory aspect decree of tariff levy economic aspects time to return on investment economic aspects operating cost of an electric vehicle technological economic aspect optimal management system reduction investment cost technological aspect technology maturity finally the criteria that had the least participation between and for decision making are impression of technology technology not mature enough with others participants added other criteria associated with their choice these are the project presents positive financial indicators for the company additionally it can become a flagship project for the promotion of electric mobility contributing to the massification of the technology contributing to the environment among others digital transformation and organizational performance in companies in the healthcare sector electric power corporate image and the company being in the electrical sector must give a example to follow on how to apply this technology perception of competitors competing company did not achieve results expected environmental aspects insufficient final disposal of batteries regulatory aspects incipient regulation and regulations economic aspects investment cost it should be taken into account that participants could select more than one criterion and or affirmation therefore the sum of the individual percentages does not correspond to figure presents the criteria that the participants took into account when making the decision about whether or not to execute the context project figure selected criteria for decision making it is possible to identify that the aspects that were least taken into account at the time of the decision making were those related to the impression of the technology maturity insufficient the perception of competitors competitor company did not reach the projected results environmental aspects referring to the final disposal of insufficient batteries emerging regulatory and policy issues and the cost of capital chapter design and implementation of experimental practice the investment this shows that the participants do not use the information to a large extent of assumptions stories and perceptions without true and confirmed information on the other hand participants largely selected the criteria associated with the technology with information on the autonomy of electric vehicles evs vs average routes of the organization the regulatory aspect of law of which promotes the use of both public and private evs and the aspect related to the cost benefit analysis this is possibly because with accurate and reliable information technological context supported by previous tests and results allows us to have a guarantee and generates confidence when making decisions in a medium proportion the economic and technological aspects took precedence over the moment of decision making the economic aspects focused on the decrease of the cost of the battery the payback time and the cost of operating a electric vehicle and technological ones in the maturity of technology and systems optimal management have greater weight because it is information usually found in media of general interest of public knowledge massive and easily accessible finally it is evident that the criteria and statements provided had a direct consequence in the decision to execute or not the silver project so it is infers that information has an implicit relationship in decision making given this panorama it is necessary to formulate hypotheses that allow establishing a relationship existing between information and organizational performance having as a reference the implicit relationship with decision making information supported by the initiatives of digital transformation according to the review presented in the previous chapters and taking as a reference decision making as a support for generation of competitive advantages within the organization that in turn provide an improvement in organizational performance chapter model structural equations in the previous chapters conceptual issues related to the themes of digital transformation and organizational performance establishing in the search equation maps from the systematic literature review the link direct between big data and digital transformation initiatives the proposed model is based on establishing the relationship between big data as a relevant part of the transformation digital and the organizational performance of companies subsequently after reviewing the theories of dc rbv and kbv it is determined to propose a heterogeneous structural equation model that includes the contribution of the three methodologies taking as a starting point experiments and validations analyzed in the reference articles additionally e it is decided to carry out an experimental practice in order to check if the information is used for decision making to support performance organizational based on the evidence that the information provided has an impact on the decision making a link with organizational performance can be assumed in accordance with the above this chapter proposes an equation model structural that relates between digital transformation with a central axis of big data and organizational performance constructs related to transformation are presented digital and organizational performance used in the formulation of the equation model proposed structural this model presents the relationship that exists between resources transformation elements digital focused on big data and organizational performance where the participation of decision making in the generation of competitive advantages such as mediator of the implementation of bda chapter design and implementation of experimental practice finally an instrument is applied in order to validate the proposed model and establish the preponderant relationships of the model constructs of the organization that take advantage of digital transformation constructs for the construction of the structural equations model the constructs associated with digital transformation and with elements of the organization with in order to develop constructs hypotheses that relate to each of the elements of the structural equation model each construct is considered as an element of the proposed model and subsequently the relationships present between each element are analyzed through constructs to then carry out the corresponding assessment using an instrument completed by experts from the electrical sector in order to validate the model the constructs that relate to each other to give rise to the proposed constructs for the development of the model they are classified as follows

of experimental practice validation of the equation model structural to carry out a validation of the proposed structural equations model in which the relationship that exists between resources elements of digital transformation is presented focused on big data and organizational performance a survey was carried out that was answered by expert professionals in the electrical sector the profile of the professionals selected to complete the survey were professionals at the strategic level of the organization that make decisions to develop policies and strategies and tactical level of coordination and supervision of projects that you have a relationship with the use of ict the work areas of the selected professionals are from process management ict managers human resources management of projects and technological innovation the professionals were identified from the base of data built by professionals from different companies in the energy sector electricity who have participated in workshops and national discussion forums on smart grids since by the upme and the research group research group electrical machines drives em d finally of the invitations to professionals from the electric energy sector to answer the survey professionals evaluated the constructs and hypotheses of the model the instrument allowed us to give a weight to each of the hypotheses that are proposed as a relationship between each element of the proposed model this in order to establish the preponderant relationships of the model the survey presents the equation model structural proposed which is made up of interrelated constructs through hypotheses participants were asked to assign a rating between and for each construct hypotheses from h to h that relate two elements of the model and the assigned values adjust to the indicative scale in table table indicative scale to group the responses obtained in the survey figure presents the grouping of the ratings given by the participants of each of the constructs of the proposed model box plot representation graphically represents the ratings given for each construct through its digital transformation and d organizational performance in companies in the healthcare sector electric power quartiles indicating within each box the median of the data the lines that extend from the box they correspond to the maximum and minimum values of the ratings for the validation of the proposed model the constructs whose the median is within the strong relationship range of the indicative scale therefore it will include all constructs with a median greater than or equal to figure shows that construct h has a median of therefore this relationship is discarded in the final model the other constructs of the model present a median within the range established as valid however the construct h presents a great dispersion of the data by finding the q quartile of the data in a value of generating a wide interquartile range q q that allows visualization a great dispersion of the ratings for this construct within the scale of moderate to strong relationship therefore it is not also taken into account for the model definitive figure presents the conceptual diagram of the equation model validated structural additionally a correlation matrix analysis is carried out one by one of the proposed constructs annex b where no negative correlations and positive correlations with higher coefficients are highlighted to figure analysis of the validation information of the conceptual model of the relationship between digital transformation and organizational performancechapter design and implementation of experimental practice figure validated conceptual model of the relationship between digital transformation and organizational performance in this validated model the relationships given by constructs h and h were eliminated h bd allows the creation of information exchange is h connectivity is positively related to bda acceptance without the h construct it becomes evident that the information to be exchanged is not required must be exclusively of large volumes of information giving rise to the existence the exchange of information of any amount of data whether or not they are part of initiatives of big data by eliminating the relationship given by h connectivity is presented as a mediator between technology and infrastructure and the exchange of information giving meaning to the flow of information to bda through the link that allows connectivity therefore the final proposed conceptual model obtained in the present study after the validation is presented in figure digital transformation and organizational performance in companies in the healthcare sector electric power figure proposed final conceptual model obtained after validation in the final model formulated it is evident that the digital transformation strategy influences directly in the associated constructs to the management of resources both physical technologies and infrastructure as well as those associated with human resources establishing its direct relationship with these through the construct h furthermore the strategy of organization is responsible for ensuring strategic it flexibility enabling bda business partnership and alignment through senior management commitment and its management responsibility this partnership and alignment of businesses associated with bda makes possible the direct relationship with bda through construct h technology and infrastructure resources include it deployment capabilities infrastructure flexibility integration and standardization capabilities processes integration of computer systems the effective use of data aggregation data analysis tools and their interpretation this allows us to display the relationships with bd construct h and with connectivity construct h for its part human resources group the analysis capabilities of personnel associated with td initiatives the organizational relationship staff skills analytics culture and the organizational relationship for the development of functions assigned elements that allow developing the analytics present in bda construct h and generate the dynamic capacity of organizational agility construct h chapter design and implementation of experimental practice after the elimination of constructs h and h a relationship was generated between technology and infrastructure and bda through the mediation of connectivity and exchange of information where data are considered assets of organizations that at the same time generating the appropriate flow of information can provide competitive advantages to the take this information into account when making decisions according to the validation carried out figure shows strong acceptance of the direct relationship between bd and bda construct h with a median of taking as the foundation of the preceding relationship of the h construct between technology and infrastructure and big data from bda the relationship with bda capabilities is validated with a measure of that is supported by the construct h which establishes that the diffusion of bda positively influences the creation of bda capabilities these capabilities correspond to the transformation and analysis of data and is based on the adaptation of existing resources support decision making and management talent and technology consequently from of bda capabilities the implementation of bda is proposed in construct h with the management of the generated capacities the management of bda resources and guaranteeing the quality of data analytics as a consequence of the capabilities of bda and its implementation the relationships with knowledge management through the constructs h and h respectively where this management corresponds to the creation storage transfer and application of knowledge with efficient management functionalities data and proper delivery to end users knowledge sharing knowledge management establishes a positive influence on dynamic capacity organizational agility h which allows detecting and responding to changes in the environment simplifying ways of working and accelerating processes this agility positively impacts performance at the process level providing improvements in supply chain performance scp in production and operations increasing labor productivity and the offer of products and services h for its part decision making mediated by the implementation of bda construct h generates sustainable competitive advantages in organizations h this allows infer that using information from big data initiatives has an influence on decision making of decisions and agrees with the conclusion of the experimental economics experiment digital transformation and organizational performance in companies in the information sector electric power where criteria and statements as information provision influenced decision making final decision now decision making is considered as a link and support for the generation of sustainable competitive advantages an element that becomes a focus important part of the model as it is mediated by the direct influence of the management of the knowledge h organizational agility h performance at the process level h and decision making itself h therefore competitive advantages group together the related to the improvement of financial performance h with indicators such as reducing supply chain costs and generating efficient operations and economic policies that generate value for the organization furthermore they are associated with strategic performance h with the strengthening of relationships with suppliers the planning improvement and the strategic advantages generated on the competitors the influence of performance at the process h financial h and strategic levels h contribute positively to organizational performance which provides value in business strategy involves planners managers directors advisors businessmen among others likewise it allows gathering indicators for measuring performance against competitors such as quotas or participation of average market average sales volume and average sales growth organizational performance is transversally impacted by the elements technological and infrastructure associated with digital transformation human resources and their skills data analytics capabilities and their impact on the processes at hand process level and finally s about the organization s strategy which integrates builds reorganizes and reconfigures internal and external competencies to adapt to the environments of change as posed by the dynamic capabilities presented previously in conclusion we can highlight the proposed model that shows the articulation of the resource based theories managed by td strategy vision based knowledge through the integration of knowledge management with bda capabilities and their implementation in addition the boost in dynamic capacity of organizational agility through knowledge management by providing bd tools and their direct influence with human resources to generate the chapter design and implementation of experimental practice competitive advantages that drive improved organizational performance contextualized and determined by the dimensions of organization personnel and technological conclusions below are the conclusions of this research which they highlight the fulfillment of the stated objectives and purposes conclusions in the development of the conceptual framework a close relationship between the life cycle associated with digital transformation and the big conversion process data in information and knowledge therefore the theory of big data was considered as one of the foundations of digital transformation the maps from the rsl search equation repeatedly present the formation of clusters around big data organizational changes and performance strategy and business intelligence systems and management technologies and information furthermore a direct link was evident between big data and organizational performance the process of the experimental economics experiment and the validation of the model proposed allows us to identify that the processes of the organizations work as phenomena that have objective and diverse realities which can be expressed in causal relationships and measured through data in many occasions in real time and that produce knowledge as a key element in the generation of value in organizations in the decision making experiment it is shown that truthful and reliable information technological context supported by previous tests and results allows us to have a guarantee and generates confidence when making decisions this is supported by the fact that participants largely selected the criteria associated with the technology with information on ev autonomy vs average trips of the organization the regulatory aspect regarding law of which promotes the use of both public and private evs and the aspect related to cost benefit analysis the proposed structural equations model establishes a relationship between digital transformation focused on big data and organization performance nizacional from of rsl in dc theory and the contribution of some methodologies experiments and analyzed validations of rbv and kbv theories in the proposed structural equations model that establishes the relationship between digital transformation and organizational performance shows that the strategy of digital transformation must group together the constructs associated with the management of physical resources technologies and infrastructure and human resources besides the the organization s strategy must be in charge of guaranteeing flexibility strategic it enable bda business partnership and alignment through of the management s commitment and in this way makes possible the direct relationship with bda technology and infrastructure resources include in the capabilities of it deployment infrastructure flexibility capabilities integration and standardization of processes integration of computer systems the effective use of data aggregation tools data analysis tools and its interpretation allowing relationships to be established with bd and with the connectivity human resources group the analysis capabilities of associated personnel to td initiatives the organizational relationship the skills of the staff the analytics culture and the organizational relationship for the development of functions assigned which allow developing the analytics present in bda and generating agility organizational as dynamic capability a positive influence of knowledge management is established with the ability organizational agility dynamics this allows you to detect and respond to changes of the environment simplifying ways of working and accelerating processes besides this agility positively impacts performance at the process level providing improvements in supply chain performance in the production and operations increasing labor productivity and the supply of products and services digital transformation and organizational performance in companies in the sector electrical energy decision making mediated by the implementation of bda generates advantages sustainable competitiveness in organizations therefore it is inferred that using the information from big data initiatives has an influence on decision making decisions and agrees with the results of the economics experiment experimental where criteria and statements as information provision influenced the final decision making the generation of sustainable competitive advantages becomes a focus importance of the proposed model and is mediated by the influence of the management of the knowledge organizational agility process level performance and decision making of decisions the influence of performance at the process financial and strategic levels contribute positively to organizational performance which provides value in the strategy of the companies involving planners managers directors advisors businessmen among others organizational performance is influenced transversally by the elements technological and infrastructure associated with digital transformation the resources humans and their skills data analytics capabilities and their impact about the processes at the process level and finally by the strategy of the organization the proposed model articulates the theory based on resources managed by the td strategy the vision based on knowledge through the integration of knowledge management with bda capabilities and its implementation and union with the dynamic capacity of organizational agility through management of knowledge by providing tools for db initiatives the proposed model allows representing the relationships between the concepts independent and dependent organizations that interact in effect of digital transformation on organizational performance and it is possible to evaluate the contribution and reliability of each established construct and hypothesis besides this model shows the importance of digitalization in organizations to generate value in business and in decision making as long as the companies define changes in processes functions organizational culture and professional capabilities of the organization to be able to adapt to the schemes decision making operation based on real time information and finally improve your performance recommendations the present study provides the bases that demonstrate the existing relationships between digital transformation and organizational performance with input so that researchers can examine the causal relationships between the findings of the constructs of digital transformation and the changes required in organizations at the level of performance therefore based on the research carried out it is recommended to undertake investigations similar or continue with research on the following topics establish a relationship between digital transformation and data governance of the organizations to guarantee the value of data evaluate the implications of digital transformation in decision making operational tactical and strategic in the technology implementation process digital in the organization evaluate ethical considerations in the development of software applications digital transformation where competitive advantage can be

the entire organization tactical level coordinates the activities that are carried out at the operational level as well as as the decisions that are made and that affect a sector area or department specific at this level there is the production manager leaders of projects sales administration etc operational level its function is to efficiently carry out the tasks that are carried out in the organization routine tasks scheduled by the tactical level of the company section n at the beginning of the section the same decision context is presented for the groups decision context the same for all groups digital transformation and organizational performance in companies in the sector electrical energy as part of the planning for the next year of your organization it is proposed as an alternative the execution of an engineering project in the energy sector specifically related to the implementation of a mobility system electricity for the operational use of the processes and transportation by the workers of the organization the electric mobility system includes electric vehicles infrastructure of the charging stations the smart metering system and the final disposal of the batteries to this end the organization is evaluating alternatives and the decision must be made execution or not of the project in a period of no more than weeks therefore the organization asks you to make the decision in this regard having in keep in mind that if you decide to do it you will be responsible for the execution supervision monitoring operation and implementation of this project subsequently the following information is presented for each of the groups group a decision context do you decide to execute the project but b group decision context additionally the following criteria and statements are known the average return on investment of the project is eight years the investment cost of an electric vehicle is two times greater than that of a combustion vehicle the operating cost of an electric vehicle is six times less than the of a combustion vehicle do you decide to execute the project but group c decision context the following criteria and statements are known one of your competing organizations the previous year implemented a system of electric vehicles like the one proposed by your organization and did not reach the initially expected results benefits people in general from the company and the community have the impression that electric vehicles are not a mature technology the average return on investment of the project is eight years some environmental organizations affirm that the final disposal of the batteries is insufficient therefore greater pollution could be generated in the next years advisors and experts from consulting firms

xiiicontent introduction in recent years organizations from different sectors have carried out a series of initiatives to explore new digital technologies and harness their benefits matt et al amorim melao with the aim of facing competition in the midst of a globalized world amorim melao these initiatives have involved transformations mainly in the commercial area affecting products and processes as well as organizational and management structures this is known as transformation digital matt et al this has become an important part of human life and necessary in almost all companies seeking growth expansion quality and sustainability amorim melao the above because the digital transformation processes make it possible to improve organizational performance operational efficiency customer experiences and the combination of digital and physical businesses amorim melao among the benefits achieved by digital transformation are increase customer satisfaction increase customer experience improve productivity increase income from products and services and the cost reduction taking the above into account digital transformation has been associated with greater frequently to business organizations however it is also an issue that concerns to higher education institutions ies rodrigues educase the latter have the challenge of transforming themselves to address social changes cultural and technological that are being presented furthermore they face the need to provide adequate responses to the expectations of students teachers researchers administrative staff and society in general tic fits mention that education is considered a main factor of development factors that influence digital transformation in education institutions higher education national university of colombia bogotá headquarters socioeconomic therefore the need arises to implement digital transformation in the education sector akhmetshin et al this is in view of the fact that digital technologies allow transforming the educational process and transfer it to a qualitatively new and user friendly level safiullin akhmetshin for this reason and to guarantee the competitiveness of educational institutions higher education ies the digitalization of its services will be necessary as part of its process of digital transformation safiullin akhmetshin however the introduction of digital technologies in their activities will not be enough they will also be necessary cultural and organizational changes safiullin akhmetshin in that in this sense the digital transformation in a university will imply changes in all its processes taking into account its characteristics and specificity safiullin akhmetshin on the other hand research on digital transformation has been oriented especially to analyze the effects in the context of business organizations and business processes wilms et al jackson while the research on the higher education sector has been incipient in the practice it has been identified that some universities in the world have developed digital initiatives and strategies to address this transformation process no however these have lacked vision capacity or commitment for a effective implementation within their institutions mccusker babington by this requires research on how heis should understand give happiness digital transformation and the requirements associated with it l mar et al this is the starting point that supports this research which will be developed in the following way from the review of the literature the factors that influence digital transformation and are subsequently contrasted with the opinion of experts in digital transformation processes in ies for this it is taken as a case study the national university of colombia headquarters bogotá these factors will serve as a basis for those responsible for a digital transformation process in a institution of higher education the document is divided into chapters chapter presents the general context of the research the statement of the problem the research question the objectives and methodology chapter reviews the concept of transformation digital challenges and impacts chapter shows the results of the review systematic literature on the factors that influence digital transformation in chapter describes the application of the delphi method questionnaires compilation of data and analysis together with the results obtained from the evaluation made by the experts on the factors identified in chapter applied to the case of national university of colombia bogotá headquarters finally the conclusions are indicated and most relevant recommendations obtained throughout the research factors that influence digital transformation in information institutions higher education national university of colombia bogotá headquarters general context of the research in this first chapter the context of the transformation is presented in a general way digital in higher education institutions the approach to the problem with respective research question objectives justification and methodology proposal for research context in recent years digital transformation has become one of the main trends both in industry and in the public sector kaminskyi et al this it is considered an organic and structural transformation that makes use of resources of the organization especially human resources in addition to this it supports in technology in order to improve organizational performance rodrigues ventures however these are not the only elements they are also relevant organizational culture and strategic planning heavin power likewise digital transformation makes organizations search in a way permanently secure its competitive position in order to achieve this the organization supports technology which is the main cause of change and a tool essential to achieve this purpose shoham perry this becomes relevant to higher education institutions through gives that increases the competition mainly to select the best students and researchers faria nóvoa however most of those responsible for this transformation lack clarity about the different options and elements that must be considered as a consequence run the risk of not taking into account important elements or ignoring solutions that they are more favorable for a specific situation of the organization hess et al furthermore managers have difficulties in starting the process of digital transformation related to the prioritization of activities within the organization berghaus back this transformation challenges managers to rethink their business models promote digital innovation adapt their strategy structure and organizational culture to the requirements that this demands it the same thing happens in higher education institutions they have started this transformation process but still need to determine the requirements associated with it l mar et al transforming a company into a digital company is difficult however many companies have been successful and there are few that have not completed this transformation there is no single formula nor is there a guide book or checklist that managers can follow for the implementation of this process economic forum world cup even so this transformation has begun and is having a profound impact on all sectors and the educational sector is no exception educase problem statement the digital transformation in higher education institutions ies has begun but there is still a lack of research on how to understand this process the requirements necessary to start and those in charge of the process do not have the clarity regarding the elements to consider taking into account the above the present investigation its objective is to contribute with the identification of the factors that influence this transformation in colombian heis as the first step within this great process factors that influence digital transformation in higher education institutions higher education national university of colombia bogotá headquarters for the development of this research the national university of colombia bogotá headquarters given its position in the educational sector seniority and presence at the national level additionally because it is a university that has begun its digital transformation process as outlined in its global plan development research question what are the factors that influence digital transformation in education institutions higher education objectives general objective identify the factors that influence the digital transformation in the institutions of higher education specific objectives identify in the literature the facts ores related to digital transformation characterize each of the identified factors that influence the digital transformation in higher education institutions contrast with experts the factors previously characterized in the national university of colombia bogotá headquarters methodology a methodology is a structured set of guidelines or activities to help people to carry out research or interventions generally a methodology is develops implicitly or explicitly within a particular paradigm and embodies the assumptions and philosophical principles of the paradigm mingers brocklesby for this research the multimethodology of mingers was proposed which is refers to the use of a plurality of methods or techniques qualitative and quantitative in a real world intervention the above because this methodology it is complex and multidimensional which allows a closer view of reality while the use of a single method would be a limited vision by combining methodologies or parts of it allows us to build an effective combination to try to comprehensively a particular intervention mingers brocklesby this is supported by the paradigm of critical realism which supports the idea of combining different research methods what is called mixed methods research or multimethodology mingers et al critical realism directs attention toward the real problems and their underlying causes mingers et al according to bhaskar the critical realism goes against the empiricist vision of science embodied in the positivism and the idealist social vision of science embodied in constructivism or interpretivism mingers et al due to the above and to answer the research question the multimethodology of mingers brocklesby based on four phases appreciation assessment of the problem situation expressed by any actor of the situation literature and previous theories mingers analysis will involve methods of analysis of the methodologies and data obtained in the appreciation stage mingers factors that influence digital transformation in information institutions higher education national university of colombia bogotá headquarters evaluation evaluation of the postulated explanations and propositions affirmed within the research taking into account the objective of visualizing differentially the problem situation mingers action for this investigation it corresponds to the presentation and socialization of the results obtained during the research case study a component that is part of multimethodology is the case study this is used as a research tool applied to organizational studies and of administration among others that contributes to the knowledge iment of phenomena individual organizational social and political yin a case study can be a particular organization project or procedure and there may be multiple cases within a research project mingers furthermore the study of case often includes methods such as interviews and questionnaires mingers of in this way it allows the researcher to obtain a holistic view and capture the significant features of real life events e g processes organizational and management international relations and industry evolution yin taking into account the above the national university was taken as a case study of colombia bogotá headquarters given that among the public heis it is the oldest and representative of the country due to its coverage and presence at the national level locations besides it is currently in the beginning stage of a transformation process digital as mentioned in its global development plan project cultural and collective of the nation this is oriented towards a culture of transformation digital through organizational transformation that allows the integration of teaching research extension and administrative support processes for the generation of new training processes with digital learning national university of colombia to analyze the case of the national university of colombia bogotá headquarters it was taken as reference the phases of mingers multimethodology and yin s case study see figure figure multimethodology applied in research own elaboration delphi method after the factors influencing the digital transformation in the assessment and analysis phases we proceeded to evaluate these factors applied to higher education institutions heis the latter carried out through the delphi method which consists of obtaining information from a group of participants zapata ebrero or panel of experts zartha sossa et al in relation to a certain research objective leon and montero cited in liaño pascual ezama the result was the perceptions of the experts blasco mira et al factors that influence digital transformation in information institutions higher education national university of colombia bogotá

most cited authors were taken of the last years this allowed us to know in a general way definitions fields of action challenges and barriers in this regard to define the second search equation the term was taken digital transformation and its synonyms digitalization and digitization digitization since these two terms are used as synonyms for transformation digital this as a result of the first search equation also included were the terms higher education institutions its acronym in english hei university and educational organization given that it intends to investigate digital transformation in higher education institutions additionally the terms were incorporated associated with the organizational and management aspect in education institutions superior and in search of the factors or enablers that influence the transformation digital literature selection from the proposed search equations we continued with the selection of the literature raised by leitner rinderle

digital technologies social networks devices mobile analytics or embedded devices to enable improvements important business such as improving customer experience streamline operations or create new business models matt et al the digital transformation strategy is a plan that helps companies companies to direct the transformations that arise due to the integration of digital technologies berghaus back digital transformation encompasses digitalization processes with a focus on efficiency and digital innovation with the aim of improving existing physical products haffke et al digital transformation encompasses the digitalization of communication channels sales and communication which provide new ways to interact and interact with customers and the digitalization of products and services of a company digital transformation also describes the triggering tactical trading movements or strategic through data driven insights and the launch of digital business models that enable new ways to capture worth kane align strategy workforce culture technology and organization structure to meet digital expectations of customers employees and partners hess et al it has to do with the changes that digital technologies can cause in the business model of a company resulting in modified products or organizational structures or in the process automation these changes can be observed in the increasing demand for internet based media which has led to complete business model changes e g in the industry of the music horlacher et al use of new digital technologies such as social networks

system must have a broader approach and should include the modernization of the management of corporate it architecture which could provide important contribution to the structuring of innovation efforts in education source own elaboration based on vial morakanyane et al and l mar et al these definitions have in common the use of technology as a crucial factor for improve organizational performance leading to changes in procedures and the organizational structure fischer et al as well as in the offer of new products or services bockshecker et al however the technology within digital transformation process itself is only one part vial heavin power because this is a tool and not an end andi and alone it will not cause said transformation educase on the contrary it will be accompanied by factors that influence the digital transformation in the institutions of higher education national university of colombia bogotá headquarters elements such as culture skills and abilities of staff henriette et al morakanyane et al the strategy kane morakanyane et al the organizational structure and leadership kane therefore digital transformation is developed from initiatives that are generated from gradually throughout the organization or segments of it over time hess et al kane the success of these initiatives depends on how senior management coordinates them as they are executed at the same time oswald kleinemeier as well as the management of the investment that these demand mugge et al likewise digital transformation can be oriented towards different results for example in the case of a manufacturing company the digital transformation process can mean the automation of processes to deliver better quality products to the customer at a faster pace while for the service industry this can mean digitizing and improving communication and customer touchpoints gebayew et al digital transformation digitization and digitization through the literature review the terms digital transformation appeared digitization and digitization which are used synonymously yes although it is not appropriate since each term is different legner et al bockshecker et al cerstin mahlow hediger digitization refers to the integration of it with existing tasks verhoef et al for example reading online texts as pdfs not as paper textbooks cerstin mahlow hediger digitalization for its part is a transformation process induced by technology which improves the flexibility agility and responsiveness of a organization by simultaneously aligning its operations strategies processes business organizational and it structures imgrund et al this refers for for example the creation of new communication channels with online customers or mobile through the use of digital forms in order processes the use of digital surveys or the use of digital applications which implies transforming the internal and external documentation processes but does not change the activities of value creation verhoef et al another example worth highlighting is the realization of annotations in a pdf document and that these annotations can be viewed with other people cerstin mahlow hediger bockshecker et al suggests that digitization and digitization trigger digital phenomena that allow organizations to operationalize the process of digital transformation for agarwal et al digital transformation is a phenomenon that encompasses the entire organization and that seeks innovation of the core business model through the use of digital technology for example in the health sector there is widespread use of it enabling a fundamental change in the provision of health services and interaction with suppliers customers and competitors another example in the sector automotive is volvo cars this one is hiring digital executives and dedicates a part important part of your investment in r d or digital initiatives to carry out projects digital such as automated driving verhoef et al challenges of digital transformation regarding the challenges that a digital transformation process entails oliver kohnke presents a study carried out by consulting firms where mention the most important challenges that organizations face when they start this process see table factors that influence the digital transformation in the institutions of higher education national university of colombia bogotá headquarters table main challenges of digital transformation studio studio mit sloan management review and consulting mckinsey company bughin capgemini fitzgerald et al capgemini consulting bughin et al there is no urgency to start a process for lack of internal leadership or talent for digital transformation digital projects no budget available lack of data and purchase ension of how digital trends affect the competitiveness limitations of it systems inability to adopt a mindset of experimentation roles and responsibilities are not lack of specific funding for clear digital initiatives lack of vision misaligned or competing interests between digital projects and businesses traditional unclear business lack of participation or desire change current practices by of senior management culture not susceptible to change the organizational structure is not appropriately designed for digital aspect lack of leadership skills inflexible business processes for take advantage of new opportunities source oliver kohnke free translation by the author percentage of respondents study executives and managers study executives he italicized text indicates challenges related to people and the organization oliver kohnke according to table in the first study half of the challenges are related to people and the available budget followed by the lack of leadership and the lack of digital talent both functional and technical other challenges are the lack of senior management involvement or desire to change current practices associated with an organizational structure designed inappropriately for the process of transformation in the second study the lack of leadership and skills stands out in digital projects together with the lack of a mentality open to experimentation and low participation of top management to change current practices both studies demonstrate the importance of people and organizational aspects for a digital transformation process oliver kohnke faced with this the professor raffi amit of wharton mentions that it is not technology that is the obstacle to digital transformation it is the people cited in bonnet p in colombia with the digital transformation survey carried out by the national association of entrepreneurs of colombia andi in the following barriers were identified and challenges that companies face to achieve a successful digital transformation see figure lack of human capital lack of leadership lack of a clear business model lack of mentality budget lack of knowledge lack of culture figure barriers and challenges that companies face to achieve a digital transformation successful own elaboration with data from the andi digital transformation survey it can be concluded that the challenges and barriers evidenced in oliver s article kohnke and the andi survey have aspects in common such as the lack of culture and leadership the lack of a mentality open to change the lack of budget and the lack of a clear business model factors that influence the digital transformation in the institutions of higher education national university of colombia bogotá headquarters impacts of digital transformation the impacts of digital transformation focus on the customer and the organization morakanyane et al the impact on the organization occurs in three areas customer experience operational processes and business models westerman et al through the customer experience on the one hand the innovation of the services within the organization and on the other hand customer retention and loyalty with this westerman et al regarding operational processes these can generate effects in improving the efficiency of the organization save costs for both the organization as well as the customer resulting in the creation of value morakanyane et al regarding business models the reinvention of this is a process of digital transformation that sometimes involves radically changing products or services it offers and the means it uses for sales this reinvention can lead to change the nature of competition in your industry or reconfigure your supply chain value to offer an efficiency advantage over its competitors westerman et al digital transformation in colombia for the digital transformation process in colombia the national policy council economic and social conpes defined the document conpes called national policy for digital transformation and artificial intelligence which aims to aim enhance the generation of social and economic value in the country through the strategic use of digital technologies in the public sector and the private sector to boost productivity and promote the well being of citizens as well as generate transversal enablers for the sectoral digital transformation so that colombia can take advantage of the opportunities and face the challenges related to the fourth industrial revolution ir sic the topic of digital transformation is transversal to all sectors of the country mintic including the educational sector digital transformation in educational institutions higher education educase highlights that traditional higher education is reluctant to change and to risks being slow to act additionally idc mentions that the most higher education institutions seem oblivious to the changes in the society and prefer to continue working with teaching and learning processes of last century making marginal use of information technologies without however it must be considered that if heis want to persist over time and not disappear it is necessary that they evolve integrally and begin a process of digital transformation l mar et al on the other hand some heis have seen digital transformation as an opportunity to recontextualize learning cerstin mahlow hediger thus the heis have started to introduce technologies that allow creating learning contexts called anytime and anywhere tay low authors as safiullin akhmetshin call it open university which is the implementation of affordable distance education programs for people of everyone regardless of location through the use of platforms web collaborative cloud environments massive online courses flipped classroom collective intelligence etc mareca bordel distance education programs under moocs massive open online courses seem to be one of the main drivers of change faced by higher education institutions mar amescua now at the organizational level in universities the existence of a internal fragmentation of processes and a diversity of data given that these the latter are dispersed in

generates an opportunity within the digital transformation process factors that influence digital transformation in information institutions higher education national university of colombia bogotá headquarters an example of digital transformation in an hei is the case presented by faria nóvoa from the university of porto in portugal which consisted of the creation of a new shared services center with the aim of improving the quality of services delivered to the community which reduces overall costs and generates easy access to its users this center collected all the services that were

professionals who have participated in these changes below is a general presentation of the results of the interviews see figure figure technological changes at the national university of colombia based on the interviews conducted the national university of colombia began its technological change with the acquisition of an ibm computer at the end of along with two private companies in the country including knitting this equipment began to be used to perform engineering calculations and the training mainly of engineering students it was then used to rate the admission exams later a building called the computer center was created initially this was he was in charge of the payroll process later he was in charge of the networking issue later the information and processes office was created an independent office of the center computing but interrelated which was in charge of some administrative tasks of the university also in accordance with the budgetary provision of the departments and faculties the acquisition of microcomputers began the first offices to acquire these the teams were accounting and personnel and in the faculties the first was the faculty of economic sciences of the bogotá campus given all this technological boom several administrations have sought to organize and rationalize activities and tasks within the university supported with the use of available technology and the information systems that have been created and implemented with the help of students and professors mainly from the faculty of engineering factors that influence digital transformation in engineering institutions higher education national university of colombia bogotá headquarters among the computer software that the university initially acquired were spss word processor wordstar electronic spreadsheet lotus database data dbase microisis database to manage libraries becoming intensive at all university locations with the arrival of the internet the headquarters andean u unique at the time bogotá medellín manizales and palmiras and faculties independently they began to contact local suppliers which generated a computer type decentralization subsequently the university acquired information systems such as sara quipu universitas xxi today sia to support human talent processes management financial and academic processes respectively these were implemented in a way independent in each headquarters with a decentralization in the operation given the internet conditions and bandwidth from this the computer centers at each headquarters bogotá manizales medellín and palmira the same time each headquarters began to make small improvements according to the needs latent in each information system later systems were implemented information such as hermes a system for managing research projects extension and laboratories likewise the information system was established for the admission process management isysdna in recent

to the current and future challenges source own elaboration based on national university of colombia factors that influence the digital transformation the factors that influence a digital transformation process provide a point starting point to create successful transformations in organizations heavin power oliver kohnke these factors must be identified for their implementation in organizations from different sectors pihir et al by conducting a literature review of the factors that influence the transformation digital it was found that authors such as morakanyane et al highlight that the digital technologies culture strategy and capital to the human with knowledge digital ones are what enable the digital transformation process bonnet nandan and george westerman et al highlight that organizational change is one of the critical factors for any digital transformation process furthermore they define this change as the application of specific interventions to support the transition of an individual or group from a current state to a desired future state that is of the people who have to change their way of working and thinking due to the digital transformation oliver kohnke associates organizational change with three other factors new skills and competencies new forms of leadership and new capabilities organizational depending on the degree to which organizations develop these factors its culture will evolve towards a digital mentality factors that influence the digital transformation in the institutions of higher education national

culture organizational expertise digital flexibility organizational collaboration orientation towards the client own elaboration based on fischer et al imgrund et al pihir et al and rodrigues below is a description of the factors identified in the review of literature digital strategy the digital strategy is a multifunctional strategy which addresses all functions processes and procedures of the organization fehér et al bienhaus haddud strategy is the strongest differentiating aspect of organizations that they have digital maturity this is not limited to technological problems such as the use of mobile devices or migration to the cloud but shows how the organization can and should do business differently in the market kane for this reason the digital strategy must include objectives an action plan and communication imgrund et al assignment of clear and appropriate responsibilities for their implementation matt et al likewise it must be led from senior management westerman bonnet hess et al horlacher et al dremel et al pihir et al under the responsibility of a director who must align with all strategies that can affect the entire organization matt et al including them it strategy and business strategy bharadwaj et al matt et al hess et al in the digital strategy four dimensions can be identified that must be coordinated harmoniously use of technologies reflects a company s approach and ability to explore and implement new digital technologies hess et al rodrigues central processes administration education and research changes in organizational structures hess et al rodrigues functions processes and procedures of the organization fehér et al bienhaus haddud in the processes it is necessary to define methods that involve the workers in all the changes that the digital transformation entails since can generate resistance to these changes westerman bonnet financial aspects associated with the ability to finance the effort of the digital transformation hess et al a provision of funds is required sufficient since unforeseen developments can affect the initiatives of said transformation imgrund et al in the case of heis technologies emerging markets tend to be expensive which combined with financial constraints that they face can make said transformation difficult therefore it is necessary ensure that the necessary resources are available for its implementation rodrigues factors that influence digital transformation in information institutions higher education national university of colombia bogotá headquarters interest groups stakeholders students graduates faculty administration industries society among others rodrigues regarding the projection of a digital strategy it is highlighted that it is years kane organizational culture the organizational culture in the digital transformation process is perceived as a valuable strategic asset which has the potential to support such transformation and the implementation n of digital technologies westerman et al downes et al this transformation generates the development of new products and processes that require of an organizational culture with an open digital innovative mentality and with a change orientation kane et al westerman et al fitzgerald et al organizational culture is formed from shared values and beliefs of employees members of an organization about what is considered desirable deal barney also defines it as a complex set of values beliefs assumptions and symbols that define the way a company conducts its business in turn hartl hess highlight the following organizational values for the success of digital transformation table table organizational values for the success of digital transformation value description the organization s openness to new ideas and its willingness to accept opening towards implement and promote change change the orientation of all the activities of the organization to satisfy the customer needs products and processes are designed with a focus customer focused based on customer needs and continually adapted to their changes the organization s pursuit of improvement and growth through the development of innovation innovations the organization s willingness to work act restructure be flexible and adaptive agility to react to change the organization s pursuit of continued advancement through acquisition provision for of new skills and knowledge learn refers to mutual trust between the organization its leadership and members as well as trust as the organization s trust in its external partners the organization s intention to promote the empowerment of its members entrepreneurship to act proactively and independently and take responsibility the organization s tolerant attitude toward reasonable errors and support for tolerance for failure learning from failure the organization s intention to build internal and external networks to share communication knowledge and information the organization s willingness to take risks and make decisions under risk affinity uncertainty the organization s support for open non hierarchical discussion and the participation democratization of decision making processes the organization s positive attitude toward teamwork collaboration cross functional cooperation and readiness for cooperation with external partners e g customers own elaboration based on hartl hess regarding the value of tolerance for failure those responsible for digital transformation they must foster an organizational culture based on evidence for decision making decisions learning from failure and motivation to introduce employees to innovate through cross functional teams dremel et al authors like fischer et al and dasgupta gupta regarding the value of risk affinity propose that organizations must have an open minded culture that facilitates creativity and risk taking on the other hand kane et al regarding the value of the agility mention that an organization supported by this value could facilitate the restructuring or the adoption of new management concepts regarding the value factors that influence the digital transformation in the institutions of higher education national university of colombia bogotá headquarters willingness to learn jöhnk et al highlight that organizations can encourage learning through small incremental and iterative changes another important aspect that must be taken into account within the process of digital transformation is the promotion of a data driven culture heavin power fischer et al mugge et al the data must be perceived as a valuable resource that can help an organization become a digital and thus achieve a competitive advantage for this reason it is necessary to establish a culture of data exchange that allows for example business functions take advantage of this data for decision making dremel et al leadership another important aspect within a digital transformation process is leadership this is a subfactor associated with the organizational culture factor where the managers and leaders are responsible for providing guidance throughout everything the process communicate the vision to the entire organization and try to reduce resistance from employees which frequently occurs in organizations mugge et al these leaders directly impact employee performance and failure or the success of digital transformation kane et al maedche and bienhaus haddud mention that these managers must be inspiring people who drive the digital transformation process throughout the company organization likewise new forms of leadership skills and organizational capabilities which have the potential to evolve the culture of an organization towards a culture more open to innovation driven by technology kane et al within organizational capabilities the effort and teamwork is essential it is about articulating functional areas working very closely with the r d area and with the different business lines maedche resistance to change another subfactor that is part of the organizational culture factor is resistance to change authors such as hartl hess and rodrigues point out that culture organizational can be the main source of inertia that prevents the change in one organization disagreements and conflicts in organizations are seen as expressions of resistance to change but if handled properly the disagreements can also fuel innovation and learning hansen et al however resistance to change is defined as the main operational risk of a company organization organizations have learned that errors in adaptation and digital economy can be lethal for example blockbuster once controlled the largest part of the movie rental business but was unable to adapt its business model to new digital platforms such as netflix thus blockbuster declared bankruptcy in mugge et al digital expertise another factor identified within a digital transformation process is expertise digital related to the capabilities skills and training of personnel on topics digital aligned with the digital strategy fischer et al for this it is required of clearly defined roles and responsibilities within this process that support top management dremel et al currently digital transformation moves in highly dynamic markets pressing employees to continually adapt to new situations increasing their need for agility and thus demanding a greater need for lifelong learning brosi et al at the organizational level managers must carefully evaluate existing technological capabilities hess et al morakanyane et al and identify in the staff the new competencies and factors that influence the digital transformation in the institutions of higher education national university of colombia bogotá headquarters required skills colbert et al morakanyane et al fehér et al pucihar et al educase to develop these skills and competencies the organization must provide training for employees colbert et al bienhaus haddud mugge et al another option is the subcontracting of personnel for the implementation of the digital transformation process which can have advantages in terms of fewer initial investments and spreading risks more widely however the the disadvantage of this option is that it increases the risk of both losing a competition required as of becoming dependent on a third party therefore it must be maintained training processes for internal employees to obtain a competitive advantage hess et al an option proposed by dremel et al compared to the beginning of a digital transformation process is to have an external consultancy at the same time develop technical skills and internal competencies in the organization now faced with the responsibility of senior management it begins with the definition of a digital strategy which is often delegated to a manager higher entity that could be the manager of the digital area or of a business unit affected by said process of transformation hess et al this person will be fully responsible and would add authority to strategy authors such as heavin power raise the need to hire a digital director chief digital officer cdo who is focused on change organizational and customer other authors such as matt et al mention that even there is no clear answer as to which top manager should be in charge of the digital transformation possible candidates can be cio chief information officer chief information officer the ceo or the relatively new role of the chief digital officer cdo however some organizations have created the position cdo chief digital officer digital director who has a key responsibility for defining the strategy and digital transformation activities as well as managing new technologies digital and drive change in the organization becoming a focal leader singh et al pereira et al among the competencies that a cdo must possess are they find it competencies and resilience it competencies to formulate the it requirements and coordination of digital products and the resilience to cope to the problems that arise in the face of digital transformation pereira et al apart from the roles mentioned above new roles appear such as the boss data officer data scientist or data analyst in the field of marketing new functions appear such as the person in charge of the marketing study oriented to web and social networks community manager henriette et al organizational flexibility the organizational flexibility factor appears as a relevant factor within the digital transformation given that it requires flexible organizational structures and line with rapidly and continually changing market conditions dremel et al fischer et al therefore agile organizations are required oliver kohnke fettig et al imgrund et al scalable and adaptable to respond to changes in the environment imgrund et al vial defines organizational agility as the ability of an organization to detect innovation opportunities and take advantage of them quickly in the market gathering the necessary assets knowledge and relationships pihir et al complement by highlighting that these resources must be implemented or redirected efficient and effective way to create value for the organization therefore a structure flexible organizational structure includes flat hierarchies independent work and freedom of decision for employees a major challenge for most organizations today is that have traditional hierarchy based decision making processes uias multiple levels of management and area based thinking which often leads to processes that are too slow to deal with the interfunctional technological and factors that influence digital transformation in information institutions higher education national university of colombia bogotá headquarters rapid digital transformation oliver kohnke verhoef et al are rigid hierarchical corporate structures are losing importance in a process of digital transformation fettig et al collaboration regarding collaboration within a digital transformation process oswald kleinemeier and fischer et al propose that organizations must prepare your organizational processes ensure adequate communication by using technology to connect and collaborate with your stakeholders internal and external since digital transformation seeks to improve the customer experience client amorim melao the it area must have a very close collaboration with the commercial area to satisfy real needs of its clients dremel et al in the case of higher education institutions kaminskyi et al highlight that corporate it architecture is the basis for digital transformation showing that digital technologies improve the provision of educational services and the student experience customer orientation the digital transformation must be focused on the customer monitoring their experiences and predicting their needs pihir et al schwaferts baldi to the understanding their behavior and its impact on the organization rodrigues in this sense digital transformation opens up possibilities of targeting new customers and new customer segments schwaferts baldi according to westerman et al customer experience must be the center of the digital transformation designed from the outside in customer participation must be given through new digital channels and data and analytics are the vital elements of the reinvention of this experience in the case of heis they have different clients students graduates teachers administration parents industries society among others who have different behaviors towards technology that is where the digital strategy must contemplate how these will adapt and make efficient use of them rodrigues in the case of students they demand an improvement in their experience with university for example in terms of administrative processes the access available hours a day to all information and services through digital platforms rodrigues another important aspect is the information channels schwaferts baldi highlight that using an inappropriate or obsolete channel with the client can mean the loss of a business opportunity and represent a threat to the digital transformation factors that influence the digital transformation in the institutions of higher education national university of colombia bogotá headquarters evaluation of factors characterized by experts application of the delphi method once the factors have been identified and characterized based on the literature review we proceed with the evaluation of these through the experts who are part of the case study national university of colombia bogotá campus for this we used the delphi method according to zapata ebrero this method is prospective that is based on the superiority of forecasting and diagnosis of a group with respect to the results that are obtained from an individual the quality of the subjective group opinion is superior to the individual p this method involves the selection of experts varela ruiz et al who are sends a series of questionnaires zapata ebrero in anonymous communication with feedback zartha sossa et al and in different rounds they are asked for their opinion zapata ebrero for this investigation two rounds were applied considered appropriate by zapata ebrero to obtain information from experts and achieve consensus and stability in their responses the number of rounds to be carried out it is common to carry out carry out three rounds and set them in advance of the study however the limitations temporal budgetary and the difficulty of maintaining the commitment of experts they mean that in few cases a third round is carried out zapata ebrero the delphi method has three characteristics the anonymity of the participants feedback or controlled feedback and group statistical response zapata ebrero regarding the anonymity of the participants or experts it must be ensured that no participant can know the answers given by the other participants so as their identity zapata ebrero regarding feedback this consists of the transmission of information to the experts before each round in order to know the results obtained in the previous round or stage zapata ebrero the statistical group response arises from the answers given by the experts to the questionnaires whose information is treated statistically to know the degree of agreement that has been obtained on the topic analyzed zapata ebrero p experts may reflect and reconsider their position due to new approaches landaeta in this way the delphi method ends when there is a consensus in the opinions and these stabilize during the rounds or stages carried out zapata ebrero selection of experts an expert is that individual whose situation and personal resources enable him contribute positively to the achievement of the goal that motivated the initiation of the work delphi landaeta cited in zapata ebrero an expert assumes the responsibility to issue judgments and opinions varela ruiz et al as for the the number of experts must be a minimum of and a maximum of experts varela ruiz et al for this research two types of experts defined by álvarez torrado thus the first type called affected are key experts who regardless of their titles or hierarchical position they have participated in processes diagnoses or involved in similar situations know the situation under study in in this case the experts professors who have held academic administrative positions or have been advisors to the areas involved have participated in change processes organizational at the national university of colombia associated with the implementation of a new technology and or change in organizational structure the second type the so called specialists are experts who have academic experience and professional experience in the field of digital transformation and changes factors that influence digital transformation in institutions of higher education national university of colombia bogotá headquarters organizational associated with the implementation of new technologies in institutions public higher education these two types of experts must meet the following criteria willingness to participate and availability of time in the present research álvarez torrado the level of knowledge is also taken into account zapata ebrero blasco mira et al associated with the academic studies that the expert has undergraduate specialization master s doctorate added to this are the years of experience zartha sossa et al below is a general presentation of the experts who participated in the research table table characterization of the experts participating in the research code studies experience actual charge academic expert years e doctorate professor e master advisor e doctorate teacher e doctoral advisor e master advisor e master advisor e master advisor e teacher master e master advisor e doctorate professor the expert code is a code assigned to each expert in the order in which the questionnaires were received by email of the experts are key experts affected of them experts are teachers who have held academic positions at the national university of colombia administrative staff mainly at the bogotá headquarters and experts are advisors different areas of the university responsible for the implementation and coordination of information systems as a specialist expert there was a teacher who does part of the university of quindío a public university which has investigated issues of digital transformation in institutions of higher education development of the first round formulation of the questionnaire the construction of the questionnaire for the first round or iteration was based on the factors and subfactors that influence digital transformation identified in the review from the literature table table factors and subfactors identified in the literature review factor subfactor digital strategy organizational culture resistance to change leadership digital expertise organizational flexibility collaboration customer orientation within the organizational culture factor the subfactors are included resistance to change and leadership given that in the review of the literature they are discriminated and described in detail within said factor as mentioned in chapter for each of these factors and subfactors a detailed description of the itself and how these influence the digital transformation to structure the questionnaires for the first and second round likert type questions where the statements were rated from to depending on the degree of agreement of the expert with each of them c completely disagree c in disagree c neither agree nor disagree c agree c totally agree agreement each qualification had to be justified factors that influence the digital transformation in the institutions of higher education national university of colombia bogotá headquarters application of the questionnaire for the first round of the delphi method experts were contacted via email electronic which met the criteria mentioned above for this they were sent an invitation in which the title of the research was mentioned which is why which they were invited as experts and in general the delphi method in addition they were asked to confirm their willingness and availability to participate in the research the questionnaire was also attached which had parts namely title of the investigation presentation and instructions personal data of the expert questionnaire with the factors and subfactors and description of each of them with area rating with a likert type scale and space for the inclusion of new factors to judgment of each expert see annex a experts responded to this communication confirmed their willingness and availability to participate they also sent a completed the questionnaire in its entirety first round results once the questionnaires from the first round were received we proceeded to consolidate the responses received for each factor evaluated the results were analyzed through central tendency statistics such as the median and position statistics such as quartiles q q and q zapata ebrero these data allowed us to observe the information about the distribution of the responses of the group of experts it will also be used n measures of dispersion such as the interquartile range ri and the standard deviation s table the interquartile range irr was defined as a consensus measure zapata ebrero this reveals the degree of dispersion of the experts responses and is determined like this rir q q median the degree of consensus is presented with a range low interquartile zapata ebrero rir it is considered to exist consensus the consensus levels were established as follows high consensus when rir acceptable consensus for rir and rir and low consensus for rir table degree of consensus of the factors that were evaluated by the experts in the first round me factor q q q s rir consensus level organizational culture high consensus resistance to change high consensus leadership high consensus customer orientation high consensus digital strategy high consensus collaboration acceptable consensus digital expertise acceptable consensus organizational flexibility acceptable consensus the highest degree of consensus was achieved for the organizational culture factor rir followed by the factors digital strategy resistance to change leadership and orientation to the client rir in that order the collaboration factor continues with a level of acceptable consensus rir and the factors digital expertise and flexibility organizational rir the median results fluctuate between and for all factors except of the collaboration factor me which means that this last factor according to the opinion of the experts needs to be a factor that has little influence on the process of digital transformation together with the result of the interquartile range rir when analyzing the standard deviation s the lowest dispersion of the responses occurs in the organizational culture factor s followed by the leadership subfactor s and the subfactor resistance to change s thus with the values of the median and the standard deviation it is confirmed that the organizational culture factor is the factor that most influences the digital transformation process additionally in the questionnaire of this first round the experts were asked if in their opinion they considered that there were other factors other than those mentioned they could include them the experts included factors table factors that influence the digital transformation in the institutions of higher education national university of colombia bogotá headquarters table factors that were evaluated in the first round and factors included by the experts factors evaluated factors included by the by expert experts digital strategy context organizational culture change management resistance to change business architecture lead zgo innovation digital expertise technological infrastructure organizational flexibility collaboration customer orientation qualitative analysis of the first round once the experts responses have been consolidated the justification given by the experts against each factor they evaluated organizational culture factor this factor obtained the highest consensus and the lowest dispersion of responses among experts followed by its two subfactors resistance to change and leadership this shows that experts fully agree that this factor influences a digital transformation process one expert highlighted that digital transformation is not a matter of technology it is a organizational issue that involves the culture of the organization another expert in turn pointed out that public higher education institutions are very traditional who live in contact with the most recent advances in science culture and art which generates a tension between traditional and change requiring an effort to change organizational also in general experts associate organizational culture with the people and their behavior in the organization one expert indicated that the values and staff beliefs can facilitate or hinder the digital transformation of the company organization and more so in the case of public heis where the staff has been linked there is resistance to change one expert also highlighted that for the success of a digital transformation requires the appropriation of a culture digital additionally they point out that the organizational culture must be transformed so that the digital strategy can be satisfactorily integrated subfactor resistance to change regarding this subfactor an expert mentioned that public heis are organizations conservatives resistant to change and this resistance is part of the culture organizational therefore is a very great influence on digital transformation they also mention that digital transformation requires elements such as customer management change as highlighted by an expert change management must be applied throughout the entire transformation process so that this change can be effectively internalized another expert emphasized that it takes being creative for people to support the transformation likewise within this factor it stands out that people are the main axis of the digital transformation as pointed out by an expert every digital transformation process in an hei you must keep in mind a natural element in people and that is resistance to the change this management must be carried out by an interdisciplinary team leadership subfactor the experts considered the leadership subfactor important and influential within a digital transformation process one expert mentioned that without leadership it is difficult said process regarding the responsibility of leading the process of transformation an expert indicated it must be led from the rectorship of the ies furthermore the experts highlighted that leadership must be focused on people and their transformation which is not something easy or immediate it must be led by a team factors that influence digital transformation in information institutions higher education national university of colombia bogotá headquarters in addition to its expertise on the subject it must be an interdisciplinary team thought more beyond the technological which recognizes the importance of medium and long term objectives term above the immediate results digital strategy this factor was evaluated by the experts and obtained a high level of consensus the result of the median shows that the majority of experts strongly agree that this factor influences a digital transformation process they highlight that the ies public authorities in general have a functional and hierarchical organizational structure therefore a digital strategy defined by senior management is required to align and give authority to digital transformation projects an expert mentioned regarding the digital strategy that implement a strategy digital allows there to be congruence between the strategy of the educational institution superior the available technologies and the subsystems that make up the organization this with the aim of meeting its proposed objectives optimizing its performance and its competitive advantage is maintained so that it is sustainable in the future time on the other hand another expert highlighted that a digital strategy is not enough as a factor of influence a digital strategy is insufficient beyond a strategy it must there is a digital transformation policy within the ies as a vital input and guide to begin this transformation process another expert pointed out that the digital strategy is an articulating element the digital strategy positively influences in digital transformation if it is thought of in an integral and holistic way within the ies and subsequently this strategy responds to the mission and vision of an ies digitally transformed digital expertise among the factors that were evaluated this factor obtained the lowest consensus and a high dispersion in responses which indicates that it is not an influential factor within a digital transformation process one expert highlighted that digital expertise is valuable for adequate construction and direction of the digital transformation helps to avoid making the mistakes that other institutions have experienced however if it is not available it can be acquire on the other hand another expert focused on the attitude with which the digital transformation expertise helps face cultural change with confidence its importance does not lie so much or in the ease of implementing digital solutions but in the attitude with which the process is approached regarding the capabilities and skills of the staff one expert mentioned that the different roles involved in digital transformation in an hei require an analysis thorough analysis of the capabilities skills and knowledge they must have and in this measure training and guiding human resources to reach the required level other expert emphasized the issue of training within a transformation process training may be needed on the use and appropriation of the new technologies although it is not a determining factor for the transformation in complement another expert pointed out if the personnel has capabilities and skills they can be create transformations from the bottom up however less aligned and efficient in cost but somehow effective organizational flexibility this factor like the previous one is among the factors with the least consensus among the experts which indicates that it is not an influential factor within a process of digital transformation factors that influence the digital transformation in the institutions of higher education national university of colombia bogotá headquarters an expert indicated that digital transformation implies flexibility and a new culture since it requires a prior organizational transformation and adaptation to what digital likewise another expert mentioned that public education institutions superior are hierarchical rigid and inflexible organizations for the application of digital strategies which leads to slow and slow improvement and innovation processes complex an expert emphasized that not only organizational flexibility is fundamental in the digital transformation complements it with the concept of organizational agility i would add agility to this factor flexibility and agility another expert highlighted against organizational flexibility that digital transformation is linked to philosophies administrative techniques such as lean management and agile methodologies in which the flexibility of organizations on the other hand an expert indicated that heis are not flexible public institutions they are not we are not flexible even so it is possible to generate communications and responses agile which is what is really important collaboration this factor among the factors that were evaluated obtained an acceptable level of consensus and the greatest dispersion of the responses given the approach that each of the experts adopted this consensus may indicate that this factor has little influence within a process of digital transformation among the justifications given by the experts one of them mentioned that the collaboration is not a factor but an institutional value this factor should be a institutional value which must be given in all areas of the heis for this they must break the barriers s that exist in the dependencies so that the process of digital transformation can occur on the other hand an expert highlighted that the collaboration must be focused and articulated to the digital strategy to satisfy the needs of its users another expert focused on the it area el it department must transition from being a support process and become one strategic more than collaboration we must talk about an integration and holistic view of the organization customer orientation this factor obtains a high level of consensus which indicates that it is a factor that influences in digital transformation regarding this factor an expert considered that it is not a factor that influences the digital transformation he highlights that the public university market is captive so they do not need to compete as hard and therefore i do not consider it to have an influence without however there is also a market in other lines such as extension and research which are becomes more demanding and will put pressure on the transformation and even the internal client who expects better service from the university itself on the other hand some experts indicated their opinions regarding the types of client a expert mentioned in a public hei it is necessary to define who the client is and what independent of what is considered the client in a digital transformation process the stakeholders of the institution and the members must be put first of the university community another expert highlighted that when talking about clients these are of two types internal and external the first are the same collaborators and workers the latter it is important to add value to them and for them to perceive the improvements in processes procedures and provision of services along these same lines another expert highlighted that the client regardless of whether they are internal or external must benefit from the transformation finally one expert indicated that anticipate the needs of students teachers and researchers should be the challenge of each agency anticipate in instead of reacting to problems factors that influence digital transformation in information institutions higher education national university of colombia bogotá headquarters development of the second round the second round r and following the delphi method aimed to reach the consensus of expert opinions zapata ebrero on the factors that influence the digital transformation of public education institutions superior to do this a second questionnaire was developed which was presented to each expert the response he reported against each factor that was evaluated in the first round r and was asked to confirm or modify that answer i also know provided the analysis that was carried out based on the justification of the responses of the experts for each factor evaluated likewise all factors were evaluated again in the second gives round although in the first round would have obtained a high level of consensus such is the case of the factors organizational culture resistance to change leadership customer orientation and digital strategy table additionally the new factors were included proposed by the experts in that first round context change management technological infrastructure business architecture and innovation with their respective description the experts who responded to the first round questionnaire were sent a email where they were requested to participate in the completion of the second round questionnaire the access link to it was included there through from the google forms application these experts answered the entire questionnaire the results of the second round are presented in table table degree of consensus of the factors that were evaluated by the experts in the second round me factors q q q s rir level of consensus digital strategy high

collaboration acceptable systematic literature consensus context acceptable consensus innovation identified factor acceptable by consensus experts change management acceptable infrastructure consensus acceptable technological the relative interquartile range rir allows us to verify the level of consensus that is achieved in all factors zapata ebrero median results fluctuate between and which places the responses in total agreement according to the opinions of the experts of the factors and subfactors that were identified in the first round and were re evaluated in the second round all obtained a high level of consensus among the experts minus the collaboration factor which may indicate that these factors influence notoriously in a digital transformation process in a public hei the factor collaboration in the two rounds obtained an acceptable level of consensus which indicates of factors that influence the digital transformation in the institutions of higher education national university of colombia bogotá headquarters according to experts it is a factor that has little influence on a transformation process digital in an hei regarding the justification of the new factors that were identified in the first round the experts mentioned the following context factor this factor obtained an acceptable consensus among the experts and a high dispersion of its results responses s some experts mentioned that it is a factor that can lead to influence the digital transformation but not be relevant and that the context can motivate the need to adopt or develop new technologies within said transformation in this sense several experts highlighted that this factor influences the transformation digital which mention public heis present very diverse contexts in where cultures and different ways of thinking come together which influences the digital transformation and the university as an organization is not an isolated entity and requires interaction with its environment as established by the general theory of systems and the theory of organizational ecology the sector generates a synergy with the organization an expert pointed out that this factor influences digital transformation the context has a high influence on the digital transformation of heis because the latter they must respond almost immediately to meet your requirements otherwise it is exposed to failing to comply and being at latent risk of disappearing he you can see how the pandemic forced heis to rethink themselves immediately and find solutions although temporary through technology to provide coverage of his service to the community on the other hand another expert highlighted that the characteristics of the sector can make it difficult to digital transformation the university as it belongs to the public sector the dynamics of this sector are often not articulated and are far from the dynamics typical of some of organizations in the sector that dispersed and isolated vision along with the lack of integrated and interoperable mechanisms can make it difficult to carry out effective the digital transformation process in the description of this factor it was mentioned aspects such as the accreditation of the cna or public sector regulations are obstacles to overcome in a process of digital transformation regarding this several experts considered that this factor little influences the digital transformation and they highlighted the following the processes of quality have indicators other than those of efficiency and effectiveness inherent to the digital transformation good practices are not obstacles to carrying out a digital transformation process this would help in methods and procedures to adopt a better digital strategy change management factor this factor obtained an acceptable consensus among the experts and the greatest dispersion of the responses among all the factors that were evaluated s this was evident in the justifications given by the experts who focused mainly on aspects how to handle transformation that of people the it area and the use of technologies thus two experts mentioned that the change management factor is not a factor but a tool since resistance to change was already included as a factor i consider which is not an independent factor but a tool to resolve the influence negative that resistance can bring and a change management plan allows facilitate assimilation within the organization and thus generate a better adaptation simple another expert highlighted that this factor is closely associated with it management this factor affects the it management processes of organizations because it relates the importance of analyzing the risks those responsible and the impacts of a change at the it level however at the university this process is not so strict because the it changes without the planning and analysis that should compromise a strict process factors that influence digital transformation in it institutions higher education national university of colombia bogotá headquarters of change management another expert highlighted that the change management factor involves people and processes change management not only involves modifying or adapt the use of technologies within the organization also involves the people and processes which will be impacted during the adoption of said technologies which is why it is necessary to apply adequate management of that stage of transition involving all interested parties faced with this factor and the implementation of technologies an expert pointed out that although digital transformation is an organizational transformation its success is based on the implementation of correctly managed technologies also another expert highlighted that our heis are conservative and the majority of its members are formed in a period where others had to adjust to the demands of the one who has the control for this reason without change management towards a service and collaboration digital transformation may be affected technological infrastructure factor this factor obtained an acceptable consensus among the experts and a high dispersion of the responses among all the factors that were evaluated s this was evident in the justifications given by experts one expert mentioned that technological infrastructure is not a relevant factor in the digital transformation he considers that it is an important but not sufficient condition infrastructure is important for the institution however the transformation digital is more of a culture of service and collaboration than of device use for him on the contrary one expert considered that innovations in infrastructure such as cloud can alone motivate transformation likewise another expert stated it is important to have the appropriate resources and infrastructure that supports the pro transformation process otherwise it will not be possible to respond to the parties interested and involved on the other hand an expert highlighted that it must be taken into account that infrastructure is very diverse in our country and by region there is a different reality in the case of these heis are located in remote regions that have notable difficulties in along the same lines an expert emphasized that this factor allows establishing strategies of appropriation as well as estimating costs enterprise architecture factor this factor which was evaluated in the second round obtained a high level of consensus among the experts which is why it can be considered an influential factor in digital transformation in public heis this is how an expert mentioned regarding this factor that heis usually have a conventional organizational model that has evolved little in the last years and that it is time to imagine new heis from scratch also another expert considered that the enterprise architecture facilitates decision making enterprise architecture gives the north and the focus in an articulated and integrated manner which facilitates decision making and the definition of appropriate strategies to carry out the changes in the different domains processes information systems and technological infrastructure another expert highlighted that at the national university of colombia in particular there is no a business architecture in the university there is no defined enterprise architecture there are defined quality processes although they are not articulated strategies that are not always applied at the national level and the technology is dispersed which means that this business architecture map is not defined at the level national and does not influence decisions on digital transformation at the university for his part another expert pointed out that enterprise architecture is a tool enterprise architecture is a tool and also necessary in a process of successful technological transformation but i do not consider that it is the tool that influences the transformation however they also mentioned that as a tool allows orchestrate the elements involved in this transformation factors that influence the digital transformation in the institutions of higher education national university of colombia bogotá headquarters on the other hand one expert indicated that even though enterprise architecture is key within the digital transformation it is not the center of it innovation factor this factor obtained an acceptable consensus rir among the experts and one of the greater dispersions of responses among all the factors that were evaluated s thus an expert mentioned that innovation helps in improvement and change organizational within a digital transformation process as long as it is planned coordinated and organized another expert also highlighted that the novation is a driving element of digital transformation innovation is a principle potentially presedimenting within an organization which motivates to think and do things differently to achieve objectives that benefit it in that sense i think that it clearly influences perhaps as the element that drives a digital transformation likewise another expert highlighted that digital transformation must allow heis respond very quickly to the demands of a changing market and in some cases unpredictable therefore it is important to consider innovation as key piece to survive in the market and contribute significantly to said transformation along the same lines an expert mentioned that a culture of innovation in hei is essential to imagine services that make life easier and enable the development of the agents that comprise it on the other hand an expert points out that innovation is not a factor that influences digital transformation innovation is not a factor that influences the transformation digital but it is a part of said transformation research results once the questionnaires from the first and second round were consolidated the following results table table results of the factors that were evaluated in the first and second round by from the experts range quartile quartile interquartile deviation median me this degree of consensus typical s or

interquartile range vr of the distribution of responses between two rounds successive rounds which is given by the difference between the rir of the two rounds vrk rirk rirk zapata ebrero the criterion that was selected for the condition of stability is that the variation must be between that is in the interval vr it is observed that of the factors and subfactors that were identified in the review of the literature do not present significant variation between the two successive rounds digital strategy organizational culture resistance to change leadership collaboration and customer orientation this is demonstrated by the variation of the relative interquartile range between round r and round r whose indices remain within the ranges established the factors that present the least stability are the digital expertise and organizational flexibility this first factor digital expertise in the first round obtained a low level of consensus rir and for the second round it obtained a level of high consensus rir that is the experts changed their answer to a higher rating on the likert scale for the second round the dispersion of the responses as evidenced by the standard deviation

culture anizational resistance to change leadership customer orientation and digital strategy are the factors that during the two rounds they obtain a high level of consensus according to experts they are considered the most influential factors in digital transformation in institutions public higher education the factors digital expertise and organizational flexibility which in the first round obtained an acceptable level of consensus for the second round they reached a level of high consensus which may indicate that these two factors can also influence the digital transformation on the other hand the collaboration factor in both rounds obtained a acceptable level of consensus which may indicate according to experts that this factor little influence on digital transformation regarding the factors that the experts identified in the first round and that were evaluated in the second round the business architecture factor obtained a level of high consensus which indicates that it is a factor that also influences the transformation digital the other factors context innovation change management and infrastructure factors that influence the digital transformation in the institutions of higher education national university of colombia bogotá headquarters technology obtained an acceptable level of consensus which indicates that they are factors which according to experts have little influence on the digital transformation in public heis on the other hand almost at the end of the application of the delphi method of this research declared the covid pandemic a literature review was carried out on this aspect in heis authors such as eradze et al and morales et al state that situations such as a pandemic could be a factor that influences and accelerates a process of digital transformation in an hei leading to fundamental changes in the teaching evolving towards an online teaching learning scenario this new factor opens new research on digital transformation issues given the recent and new change for higher education caused by the pandemic the pandemic generated a sudden and forced closure of in person teaching leading to teachers and students to unknown terrain due to the need to adapt rapidly to digital learning environments called online education of emergency this abrupt change has forced universities to evolve towards online teaching in record time implementing and adapting resources available technological resources as well as involving teachers and researchers who they lack technological capabilities for online teaching morales et al the transition from in person education to virtual education will have implications significant for the entire learning process it will not only modify the methods to evaluate learning outcomes but will also require review of the skills and comp skills required of students in this new environment likewise there must be adequate infrastructure and technological platforms e g blackboard moodle microsoft teams and servers that allow sustain the virtual workload morales et al for example in the most universities signed contracts with companies like microsoft that provided office or teams resources or technological platforms to strengthen the virtual teaching morales et al it is highlighted that in the case of public universities additionally they will have to dealing with declining budgets due to reduced government funding united to the decrease in student enrollment due to the current economic situation uncertain then some investments will be needed to improve these capabilities techniques morales et al factors that influence the digital transformation in the institutions of higher education national university of colombia bogotá headquarters conclusions and recommendations in this chapter the results of the research are presented in summary from the question and its objectives developed through multimethodology by mingers and the case study by yin conclusions the general objective of this research work is to identify the factors that influence the digital transformation in higher education institutions and three specific objectives emerge from this for its development the multimethodology proposed by mingers the case study designed by yin and the method delphi for the development of objective no a systematic review of the literature on the term digital transformation the databases yielded results associated with this is mainly in the industrial sector this allowed us to identify definitions impacts challenges and mainly the factors that influence a process of digital transformation the review of the literature in relation to institutions of higher education some universities were identified that have implemented strategies and new processes with the introduction of technologies as part of their digital transformation process regarding the factors that influence digital transformation six were identified organizational culture customer orientation digital strategy collaboration expertise digital and organizational flexibility and subfactors resistance to change and leadership which are part of the organizational culture factor it should be noted that in the case of institutions of higher education was not clearly evidenced in the literature the factors that can influence a digital transformation process for the specific objective no the factors that were identified in the objective were taken no and the characterization of each of them was carried out for this was taken into account the features and specifications mentioned by the authors in each article analyzed finally for objective no the factors that were identified and characterized in the previous objectives through experts who are part of the national university of colombia bogotá headquarters in order to achieve the objective developed a questionnaire that is part of the first round of the delphi method which it contained the factors and subfactors identified and which were subjected to evaluation by the selected experts as a result of this first round the experts included new factors context business architecture innovation product management change and technological infrastructure table factors that were identified in the rsl and those proposed by the experts factors identified in the rsl factors proposed by experts organizational culture context resistance to change business architecture leadership innovation customer orientation change management digital strategy technological infrastructure collaboration digital expertise organizational flexibility once the two rounds of evaluation with experts have been applied the factors that obtained greater consensus and were defined as the factors that most influence the digital transformation in a public institution of higher education are the following in order of consensus table factors that influence the digital transformation in the institutions of higher education national university of colombia bogotá headquarters table factors that influence a digital transformation in an hei factor level of influence organizational culture very influential resistance to change very influential very influential leadership customer focus very influential digital strategy very influential digital expertise very influential organizational flexibility very influential enterprise architecture very influential collaboration not very influential context not very influential innovation little influential change management not very influential technological infrastructure little influential the identification of these factors provides an answer to those responsible for the implementation of digital transformation as mentioned by hess et al the most of those responsible for this transformation lack clarity about the different options and elements that must be considered as a consequence run the risk of not considering important elements or ignoring solutions that are more favorable for a specific situation of the organization as a result of the evaluation by experts it can be concluded that the factors identified in the research are applicable to a digital transformation process in a higher education institution in this case a public hei finally a factor that can influence a digital transformation process and that can make it worse are exceptional situations like a pandemic since like it happened in in a few weeks changes were necessary in the sector educational especially in heis from a face to face teaching process to one of type virtual mobilizing the entire organization to a new educational and organizational process with the support of its technological infrastructure recommendations this research was carried out to respond to the need of how to start a digital transformation process in a higher education institution ies identifying the factors that influence this transformation although this research has as a case study the national university of colombia headquarters bogotá for future studies it is proposed to apply the delphi method and the associated questionnaires for the other campuses of the university and thus confirm the factors that can influence digital transformation in a public hei even count with greater participation of experts not only belonging to an hei but also external experts who are working on this topic in the educational sector this will allow us to deepen and consolidate these factors and the identification of new factors on the other hand at the end of the application of the delphi methodology the researcher had access to information on the process that is being carried out of digital transformation in the national university of colombia in which they identified factors of change described in section for this reason these factors were not taken into account account in the present research which provides an opportunity for future investigations that allow contrasting the factors that have been identified in this institution and the results of this investigation and that can influence said transformation proccess in the medium term it is proposed to apply the proposed questionnaires under the delphi method in private and official higher education institutions to contrast the factors identified that influence digital transformation and thus obtain a general overview in the colombian context factors that influence the digital transformation in the institutions of higher education national university of colombia bogotá headquarters also it is proposed to investigate how exceptional situations such as a pandemic and in especially the one caused by covid could influence a digital transformation process in an hei finally in the long term it is proposed with these identified factors and other factors that identify with experts a model for adopting digital transformation in heis that allows evaluating these factors a annex questionnaires used in the

transformation td emerges as a process of incremental disruptive change which begins with the adoption and use of digital technologies then evolves towards a deliberate holistic conversion of an organization in the pursuit of creating worth however this path of transformation is not simple so the organizations need a roadmap through which they plan and control said management emerging td maturity models as a tool for said functionality under this need a study was carried out in a colombian organization in which the evaluation of its td capacity is addressed identifying how this process has been developed from the dimensions strategy tasks culture people structure so that it reaches a new stage in which digital technologies don t limit yourself to separate divisions channels or functions but are used throughout the entire organization to support corporate strategies based on the conception that a effective digital culture is an intentional and global effort supported by its human talent the objective of this final master s thesis is to analyze the degree of maturity of the digital transformation of an organization to achieve this objective a mixed non experimental and descriptive research in three stages characterize the methods models for measuring the maturity of td in an organization based on a systematic literature review apply the measurement method model

schwab currently there is a transition in the dimensions economic and social of a society hyperconnected to a digitalized world in which business production and governance models of the traditional economy coexist with those that emerge from the new technological paradigm and welcome its innovations consolidating a new digitally interwoven system in which the models from both worlds interact

require constant technological update alekseev et al gils weigand sewpersadh with positive impacts on the environment in accordance with what is indicated by eclac digital technologies can contribute significantly to promoting the three dimensions of sustainable development stimulating growth equality and sustainability figure dimensions of digital development and its disruptive effects source adapted from eclac b introduction problem statement according to authors such as alkan cheng et al frank et al guo et al feng li peng tao salume et al shahi sinha and sousa et al romero et al at the time of launching the transformation digital in organizations does not take into account whether they are prepared to carry out this process of metamorphosis from a strategic business philosophy that internalize change and innovation a sustainable economic situation and a culture organizational acceptance of new technologies carrijo et al ghobakhloo iranmanesh gils weigand heredia et al mihardjo et al venkateswaran jyotishi that is initiating this disruptive and holistic process without a clear objective beyond acquiring new technologies that improve some operation or that promote the idea of being a company at the technological forefront affects the result end of this management process minimizing it to the purchase of new technology which in in many cases it is not aligned with the reality of the company alkan calle et al frank et al ghobakhloo fathi gileva et al gils weigand guo et al leonardus et al salume et al sousa et al the digital display offers facilities that do not go hand in hand with the actual operation of many companies which follow the precepts and paradigms from their culture organizational and static and myopic management bordeleau felden feliciano cestero et al guo et al nerima ralyté shahi sinha yamamoto and instead of getting performance and productivity improvements they end up with acquisitions high cost technological technologies to continue with the same gaps that distance the organization of competitiveness optimization and effectiveness caputo et al carrijo et al cheng et al de carolis et al gils weigand hanelt et al nerima ralyté reyes et al salume et al sheng et al as digital investments increase companies face a paradox of digitization and cannot receive the corresponding return but companies that properly performed digital investments can achieve good performance brozzi et al cheng et al feliciano cestero et al mahraz et al shahi sinha teubner due to the negative effects of digital transformation short sighted managers may delay its implementation while the effects positive results lead to excessive digital transformation cheng et al guo et al in this way managerial myopia moderates the relationship between digital transformation introduction and company performance aghamiri et al guo et al heredia et al sheng et al this situation is aggravated by not knowing the current organizational status or situation without be able to trace a path of progress and move incrementally towards a higher degree of digital transformation maturity aghamiri et al brozzi et al frank et al ismagilova et al reyes et al strutynska et al likewise this ignorance of the level of maturity of digital transformation in organizations limits its ability to progressively evolve in the development of key capabilities to be successful in the new digital era cheng et al christensen et al gileva et al haryanti et al ismagilova et al lorenzo ochoa saleh awny seyedghorban et al sousa zomer et al sousa et al usai et al in summary the problem that is addressed in this final master s thesis is that there is the need for organizations to evaluate their processes to discover how they are prepared for digital transformation and how to develop your roadmap see figure in accordance with the principle of the systemic approach of continuous improvement where if they are not measured or they evaluate the processes there are no feedback processes from the various problems indicated here several research questions arise such as how the organization s strategic planning should be designed for the achievement of digital transformation what is the appropriate route to follow for the transformation digital why do organizations limit digital transformation to achieving only digitize and or digitization what is the ideal situation for a company to carry out the digital transformation what factors and variables trigger the generation of digital companies and their sustainability over time what is the degree of maturity of the digital transformation of an organization among others however the research question addressed in this final master s thesis is what is the degree of maturity of an organization s digital transformation according to riascos gonzález the process of measurement analysis and improvement is very important given that what it cannot be measured it cannot be improved and according to william thomson kelvin lord kelvin physicist and mathematician british what is not defined cannot be measured what is not measured can not be improved it if it is not improved it is always degraded albrecht brummett mullins komisar introduction figure causation framework and problem impact source self made in this argument of the identified problem colombia although it has made progress in consolidation of more proactive and efficient public entities which appropriate and use the information and communications technologies ict to provide better services to citizens and optimally resolve their needs from the government strategy introduction online and with the deployment of the digital government policy pgd since mintic according to the digital government index during the period national entities have only managed to gain on average points in the implementation of the pgd for their part the territorial entities have advanced in average points in the implementation of the pgd mintic even though the public digital transformation was established as a priority for the government in the plan national development pact for colombia pact for equity and in the articles and of law of dnp mintic with the update of the digital government policy through decree of mintic colombia seeks to direct itself in achieving this objective with this evolution the pgd seeks to make a more digital state a reality for this reason for the country it is public digital transformation is essential to make a colombia a reality modern and competitive understanding it as the process of exploitation of technologies digital technologies that have the ability to create new ways of doing things in all sectors of public administration generating new development models processes and the creation of products and services which in turn produce value mainly through of digitization that represents the conversion of data and analog processes towards formats that can be understood and processed by machine inas mintic now according to the objective of copes to increase the generation of social value and economic through the digital transformation of the public sector and the private sector through the reduction of barriers the strengthening of human capital and the development of enabling conditions so that colombia can take advantage of the opportunities and face the challenges related to the fourth industrial revolution dnp the organization where the digital transformation maturity model mmtd was applied as it was public in nature of regional order and the manager to secondary education in the capital in charge of promote educational offerings the quality and relevance of education guide and lead the formulation and execution of policies plans and programs to guarantee the right to education recognizes this objective and aligns it with the digital government policy and the national development plan colombia world power of life dnp in this desire of the organization where the mmtd was applied to promote the use and taking advantage of information and communications technologies to consolidate a competitive proactive and innovative state and citizens that generate public valueintroduction in an environment of digital trust since its management mintic recognizes its need to constantly evaluate your digital transformation process to identify opportunities for improvement that will successfully lead to the achievement of this objective and the establishment of a roadmap that allows the planning of the process its execution controlled and measurable the optimization of the resources that feed it and the obtaining of the best possible results goals to answer the research question the following objectives have been established general objective analyze the degree of maturity of an organization s digital transformation specific objectives characterize the methods models for measuring the maturity of the transformation digital from a literature review apply the method or model for measuring the maturity of digital transformation more appropriate to the organization propose recommendations to the organization to improve its level of maturity of the digital transformation based on the results of the application design of the investigation to achieve the proposed objectives the development of a descriptive study was established since this type of study is aimed at measuring the presence characteristics or distribution of a phenomenon in an organization at a moment of cut over time limiting itself to describing one or several phenomena without the intention of establishing causal relationships with other factors veiga de cabo et al in turn it is considered that there was no intentional manipulation only the phenomena were observed as they were gave in their natural context the type d and research design of the final work mastery was non experimental see figure introduction the research approach used in this final master s thesis was mixed see figure since quantitative and qualitative techniques were combined to obtain the information necessary to respond to the objectives of the study j w creswell john w creswell creswell tashakkori teddlie consequently for to achieve the objectives three phases were executed namely characterization of the model of digital transformation maturity mmtd in which the methods models for measuring the degree of success in the strategic change process of adoption and use of digital technologies based on a systematic literature review rsl and the mmtd to be applied in the organization under study was defined estimate the level of maturity of the digital transformation through the application of the maturity model of the digital transformation mmtd most suitable for the organization and data analysis obtained and recommendations in which recommendations were generated to the organization to improve your level of digital transformation maturity based on the results of the application for each organizational dimension evaluated according to the selected mmtd figure research design source self made main results the main result is the analysis of the degree of maturity of the transformation digital of an organization once the selected mmtd was applied as a result of a study based on the characterization from an rsl of the methods and models of introduction measurement of the maturity of the digital transformation and the particularities of the entity simultaneously this characterization of the mmtd in itself is a result of the work master s degree by studying maturity models that provide a tool for appropriation of knowledge for the field of study and application to finally deliver recommendations to the organization that improve its degree of advance or development in the use and appropriation of technology and digital data in a manner planned and controlled in search of optimization of its performance competitiveness evolution of its functional structures and the creation of new business models that generate products or reformed organizational structures based on results by dimensions of analysis of the applied mmtd strategy tasks culture human talent and structure likewise it is worth highlighting that the defined methodology of the mmtd was enriched selected by grouping the questions from your information collection tool according to its dimensions and add a gap analysis in which a state is defined ideal and an objective state to then define opportunities for improvement this final master s thesis is structured in six chapters that i develop they call theoretical and application foundations to provide solutions to your specific objectives of subsequently in the introductory section the problem is explained the question of research objectives research design main results and limitations along with annexes that complement its development chapter defines the state of the art defined based on a review exercise of literature through which the theoretical foundation of the final work is structured in chapter an analysis and classification of the maturity models of digital transformation mmtd in order to define which is the most appropriate to apply according to the characteristics of the organization that is the subject of the final master s thesis chapter contains the adoption of the selected mmtd through adjustments made to the model tools for adaptation to the singularities of the target organization study in chapter the application of the mmtd is carried out according to the proposed methodological design these results define the advances and gaps in the organizational path of the process of digital transformation chapter establishes recommendations for the organization to improve its level of digital transformation maturity based on the results of the application for each introduction one of the study dimensions and in accordance with the gap analysis methodology posed and finally chapter presents the conclusions that describe how the proposed objectives were met the advantage of using the design of the chosen research the contrast of the research design and the practical environment the impact of the research for the practical and study context the limitations found and future work and possible lines of research digital transformation state of art this chapter aims to describe the key concepts characteristics constructs importance and impacts of digital transformation this chapter is made up of the following sections a first that describes the method of the systematic review of literature rsl to obtain information and its subsequent analysis in the second section the difference between digital transformation and digitalization from the change in strategic thinking towards organizational competitiveness the third section focuses on the relationship existing between digital transformation strategic planning and the value chain the digital transformation in the colombian context is shown in the fourth section and a summary of the chapter is provided in the fifth section method to achieve the proposed objective for this chapter the review method was used systematics of literature rsl proposed by kitchenham et al and expanded by galvis lista sánchez torres and sánchez torres miles in which define three stages planning information search and structuring of the state of the art the steps for each stage are in figure planning the information search according to galvis lista sánchez torres kitchenham et al and sánchez torres miles in the identification of search needs they established six guiding questions which are listed below what is digital transformation and digitization analysis of the degree of maturity of the digital transformation of an organization what is the difference between digital transformation and digitization what is the relationship between strategic planning and digital transformation how are the value chain and digital transformation related what are the keys to success for digital transformation what is the panorama of digital transformation in colombia figure method for defining chapter source adapted from galvis lista sánchez torres kitchenham et al sánchez torres miles as quality criteria for the selection of studies related to transformation digital were defined level of explanation of the topic offered by the study degree of relationship with the topics of interest and results and conclusions of the study as well as the bibliography used for the classification of studies related to maturity models of digital transformation the quality criteria for the selection were the degree of description of the model level of clarity and impartiality in obtaining analyzing and presentation of results if the study presents the method of application of the model and model validation methods chapter search for information in this stage a search strategy was built iteratively with terms associated with digital transformation digitization and maturity models that was executed in the scopus database limited between and see table table search strategy search matrix search item search equation results first filter second filter title abs key digital transformation or title abs key digitization and title abs key scopus digital transformation articles articles articles maturity model or title abs key digital maturity and publish source self made in the results obtained from the search two filters were applied the first level of reading with analysis of the title abstract introduction and conclusions of each article he the second filter reading level included a more in depth scrutiny of the document in which its base theory development validation and results were analyzed in both filters applied the previously defined quality criteria in this way it they got a articles in total of which in a first level reading they selected to ultimately reduce the group to documents in the reading second level from the results of the rsl it can be seen in table that between and there are about articles published and an annual growth of articles about digital transformation it stands out in that the articles published are more than times that of see table and that of almost times greater than at of the year almasri et al mahraz et al the above indicates the interest growing in the generation of knowledge in this area and its appropriation at the level business and social in validation of what was stated by gebayew et al it becomes clear that the articles found for were not taken into consideration because they would only correspond to the scientific production of the first quarter of the year analysis of the degree of maturity of the digital transformation of an organization table documentary production on digital transformation by year number of articles of articles increase in year published by year published articles by year total source self made the analysis by thematic area of the articles obtained as seen in figure presents the different fields of application of digital transformation from to along with their percentage contribution by area

relationships in structures that yoo et al are mediated by digitized artifacts and relationships with capabilities thorseng grisot recently integrated digital industrial management literature defines digitalization as the phenomenon of parida et al connected intelligent machines that enhance information and technologies lerch gotsch digital lenka et al digitization describes a change from analog

digitalization is defined as the use of digital and data technologies to generate revenue improve business replace transform processes clerck commercial and create an environment for digital business in which information digital is at the center digitization means the transformation of all types of information text machekhina sound images video and other data from various sources into digital language the action or process of digitizing digitization analog data conversion parviainen et al especially in images videos and texts for later use r in digital format it is not the emergence of a

transforms socio technical structures that were previously mediated by non digital artifacts in others mediated by digitized artifacts eling lehmann gebre mariam bygstad reis et al what l is the difference between digital transformation and digitization in the rsl there are authors such as maltaverne srai lorentz kääriäinen et al and wessel et al that show the mixed and indistinct use of the terms digitize digitization digitization and digital transformation when the difference between these is quite significant when considering their scale of impact on the organization and the level of occurrence of change from one to another as shown in the figure then we have to digitize digitization is the material process of converting analog flows of information in digital bits brennen kreiss digitalization refers to the technology of digitizing information a simple automation which provides the appropriate information systems to operate the processes and uses digital technologies and data in order to generate income improve business replace transform processes and create an environment for digital business where digital information is the core that is it is the transformation enabled by it digital technologies and digitized information to create the value of new forms of processes clerck gobble parviainen et al reis et al g rodríguez abitia bribiesca correa wessel et al ringenson et al support these definitions and find them useful to highlight the difference between the technological conditions necessary for related social change digitally digitize digitization and real change digitalization regarding the analysis of the degree of maturity of the digital transformation of an organization digital transformation this is understood as an evolutionary process that takes advantage of the digital capabilities and technology to enable business models processes operations and consumption experiences that generate value morakanyane et al verhoef et al a profound remodeling of the it based organization demlehner laumer verhoef et al at this point wessel et al generates a parallel between digital transformation and it enabled transformation or digitalization as different but related concepts because both address the effect of leveraging it on the value proposition but the it approach digital transformation is in its definition and is related to the creation of the identity of a new organization while it enabled transformation is focuses on supporting it and is related to the improvement of an existing identity aghamiri et al gobble wessel et al figure definition of digitalization digitization and digital transformation source adapted from maltaverne in short the distinction between the three terms is described as follows digitization is focuses on the generation of data or digital information alized with a low impact on the process of transformation of the organization and change of the business model the digitization focuses on the automation of processes that allow improvements in the business model in a digital environment with a medium impact on the change of the organization and the digital transformation is heading into the disruptive process that potentializes at a high level the change in the structuring of the organization and its evolution towards an intelligent business in this way it is observed that through the digital transformation digitization and digitization are obtained but not chapter contrary and that if these three are not well directed from the organization s strategy it can only end with a waste of resources digital transformation strategic planning and the value chain what is the relationship between strategic planning and digital transformation the coupling of technology with the global strategy of an organization must be a latent reality in companies bellantuono et al escorsa valls jonathan et al jonathan et al with two paths to achieve this through integration of methods and technologies in the different areas of the organization oriented in a common strategic way or through the germination of a technological strategy merged into the global strategy focused on fundamental production technologies with orientation towards the market in which the union of the efforts of research and development with long term needs mahraz et al núñez de schilling schwertner serinikli

aspects that they consider key in their organizations are a process and channel of digital marketing and digital services or products andi in this line to at the beginning of of colombian companies had an area and a budget destined for digital transformation which positioned colombia among the last countries in the region sierra however the vital need of continue operating turned the covid pandemic crisis into a opportunity for growth and promoted that at the end of the percentage would increase by almost sierra in the digital transformation survey of the national association of entrepreneurs of colombia andi companies in colombia considered that the most incentives important to start a digital transformation are the use and appropriation of new technologies the development of new business models and customer expectations andi focusing on automating processes reducing costs and achieving industries the as investment objectives in digital transformation likewise for of the organizations tified the impact of investments made in technologies emerging by delimiting your digital strategy based on a clear objective and verifying the performance of the resources applied in the results obtained the companies colombians consider digital transformation as a disruptive process that promotes development supported by the fact that of them perceive it as a opportunity to

innovation with the business strategy supported by digital technologies as a driver of change analysis of the degree of maturity of the digital transformation of an organization pwc colombia cintel in accordance with what was found in the literature to the potentialization of the digital transformation and that has been described in sections previous chapter summary in this first chapter an rsl was developed that answers the six questions formulated guidelines that lead to the structuring of the state of the art of the present final master s thesis from the definition of digital transformation its difference with digitization to then define the relationship it has with strategic planning innovation and the value chain to finally have an overview in the context colombian the main result of the rsl is the concept of digital transformation understood as the use and appropriation of technology and digital data in a way planned and controlled to radically improve the performance or scope of companies their competitiveness the evolution of their functional structures and the creation of new business models that generate products or structures reformed organizational structures bertello et al cheng et al gils weigand mahraz et al pan et al westerman et al likewise it is observed that thanks to the rsl the concept of transformation was analyzed digital outlining it in its typology

transformation of business processes and the transformation of business models with this chapter partially achieves objective one of this final master s thesis chapter maturity models digital transformation characterization analysis and selection this chapter aims to characterize the maturity assessment models in digital transformation to apply the most appropriate to the needs and characteristics specific to the organization under study consequently the four main sections of this chapter are in which explains the method for the development of the chapter where the models are characterized of digital transformation maturity mmtd through which the comparison of the mmtd and in which the maturity models are analyzed for finally select the most appropriate one for the organization method to achieve the objective of this chapter three stages were established the first followed the rsl method described previously in section a second stage of characterization of the mmtd and a third stage where the model of maturity most appropriate to the organization under study according to figure figure method for defining chapter source own elaboration analysis of the degree of maturity of the digital transformation of an organization systematic literature review at this stage the method described in section was applied to respond to the guiding questions what is a maturity model and what are the models of existing digital transformation maturity characterization of maturity models digital transformation to characterize the mmtds with a standardized perspective their objectives dimensions variables methods indicators and classification levels of the maturity see figure for this purpose the characterization sheets of mmtd which are presented in annex a at the same time the completeness of the mmtd to evaluate if it was possible to replicate it in the organization of interest figure characterization of digital transformation maturity models source self made figure exemplifies the mmtd characterization sheet which shows describe the mmtd obtained thanks to the rsl chapter figure fic model has mmtd characterization source self made selection of the digital transformation maturity model for the selection of the mmtd the following criteria and their respective scales were defined quantity and quality of methodological information about it that is presented in published studies as a critical factor for selection here it is evaluated the existence of complete information on the mmtd methodology objectives dimensions variables methods indicators tools and levels of maturity and is rated zero does not exist and one exists methodological clarity for the application of the mmtd model evaluated according to the description of the methodology for applying the model the scale applies according to the understanding offered by the methodology to be able to use satisfactorily the mmtd zero described regularly one described moderately and two fully described adaptation of the mmtd to the organization under study that is if the field the base application of its design is similar to that of the reference entity of the present final master s thesis this criterion seeks to evaluate whether the field application for which the mmtd was designed matches that of the organization object of study the field of action refers to the industry or type of analysis of the degree of maturity of the digital transformation of an organization organization and earns the maturity model a score of zero not suitable and one suitable the selection criteria were applied at two levels the first where the criterion was used and the second level of selection in which criteria and were used to obtain the mmtd that is going to be applied in the organization see figure figure selection of digital transformation maturity models source self made for the level two selection of the mmtd the information contained in the sheets was studied of mmtd characterization which are presented in annex a if you have a tie it was defined that the mmtds that have the same scoring based on the previous selection procedure but executed by a set of experts on the subject and subsequently a weighting of the total scores generated by the group of experts for each mmtd that is the assessment given by each expert in the three criteria will be added and then averaged based on the number of experts who participated in the qualification of each of the mmtd in a tie chapter the assessment of these criteria is presented in the model selection matrix digital transformation maturity mmtd see table in the total score column the total values of the classification are observed of the mmtd shortlisted according to criterion six mmtds were obtained with the highest score awarded by the classification of criteria and these maturity models also showed a tie each other in this case in which a tie was generated in the highest total scores awarded according to the mmtd selection criteria a second round was carried out of analysis and selection of the mmtd with the highest scores based on the criteria already established and jointly with the experts of this master s work director and co director and the organization s digital transformation representative due to his technical and professional knowledge on the subject and the entity keep in mind that for the final selection of the mmtd the grades awarded by the experts director and co director of the master s degree work and the representative in td of the organization where the chosen mmtd was applied all identified with the acronym ex expert were averaged to have the total score these experts were selected for having the knowledge and expertise in the field of digital transformation both at an academic and professional level and on the organization by meeting the following characteristics have knowledge and training in areas related to digital transformation have expertise in the digital transformation process planning execution control and evaluation manage knowledge regarding digital transformation have knowledge of the organization where the chosen mmtd was applied and its direction in matters of digital transformation characterization of maturity models digital transformation the maturity of a topic refers to the state of being very advanced or developed for an east and is structured in a set of dimensions that together describe the its entirety gollhardt et al thus maturity models mm are analysis of the degree of maturity of the digital transformation of an organization a tool used to evaluate qualitative and quantitative capabilities through a series of sequential levels which together form an anticipated logical path or desired from an initial state to a final state of maturity carrijo et al proença borbinha the mms with their organized and systemic structure allow companies evaluate different aspects of the organization and compare their levels of maturity with its competitors and with those who present the best practices of the market which makes it possible to develop action guides to reach the highest levels high market maturity carrijo et al proença borbinha along these lines digital transformation maturity models mmtd help to understand and structure the concept of digitalization carrijo et al and provide an estimate of the current capabilities and maturity of organizations and general directions towards the desired level of maturity de carolis et al schumacher et al roy wend ler the mmtd must consider the differences of the industries and their stages of development so that their diagnosis and classification of the maturity level are related to the reality of the organization aghamiri et al carrijo et al reyes et al because the digital transformation has different effects in different industries and those with customer orientation and relationship business to consumer bc are affected by digitalization faster and much more than those with business to business bb relationships carrijo et al demlehner laumer the authors j becker et al de carolis et al nerima ralyté and soares et al define that mmtds can serve three functionalities different i descriptive those that analyze the level of maturity and the current objective of the company ii prescriptive those that present guides for the company to achieve the desired level of maturity focuses on the relationships of the domain with performance and indicates how to approach improving maturity to positively affect the value of the business and iii comparative when comparing the current level with the market benchmarking and the maturity levels of competitors a model of this nature could compare similar practices between organizations to compare maturity within different industries however the mmtd may be descriptive by design but may develop a roadmap and present the consequences of its comparative application gollhardt et al another classification of mmtds is provided by gollhardt et al who state that in general two types of mmtd can be distinguished the approachchapter quite classically specifies individual maturity in the form of fixed levels where the scale five levels is the most common these fixed levels can be staggered or continuous and focus area maturity models on the other hand each criterion can have disparate levels of maturity in terms of quantity and distance from each other van steenbergen et al based on the rsl the following mmtds were identified recorded in table governed by the five requirements for

oswaldo lorenzo guillermo rodríguez abitia and isaac ambrosio da silva as references found in the literature on digital transformation and their respective models of maturity and frameworks although this last author is portuguese speaking his context is analysis of the degree of maturity of the digital transformation of an organization the latin american when he found himself in brazil additionally as references in the context colombia in matters of digital transformation had the regulations models of maturity and reference framework of digital transformation generated by the ministry of information and communications technologies of colombia the national department of planning and innpulsa figure represents the mmtds on a timeline that provides an overview overview of these models to continue with a brief description of their purposes in annex a compiles the information considered relevant for each mmtd in their respective characterization sheets however below is a classification of mmtds based on the details of the characterization carried out mmtd precursors the first maturity model that appears in the selection and timeline see figure is the industry digitizatio n index friedrich et al that seeks to better understand what industries in which markets are adopting and benefiting from digitalization first and which are lagging behind in addition to obtaining information on the factors specific technological developments that allow certain markets and industries to advance more quickly the digital transformation maturity roadmap for billion dollar organizations westerman et al investigates the ways in which large traditional companies around the world manage digital transformation and benefit from it to understand how digital technology changes the business of large leading firms and finally propose the transformation framework to promote a successful digital transformation the digital maturity matrix or maturity model developed by the center for digital business from mit massachusetts institute of technology westerman et al compares digital practices around the world identifies the components essential aspects of digital maturity and examines the links between digital maturity and financial performance the status of digitalization w becker et al wants to obtain a current opinion on the understanding and use of digitalization in terms of information and communication technologies within medium sized companies he digital maturity model peyman et al schäfer et al provides a metric to assess digital maturity from the perspective of different stakeholders and establishes fields of development and specific optimization potentials in areaschapter individual this model thus creates the basis for the development of the roadmap and a model reference for the sustainable development of digital excellence mmtd with an economic focus on digital transformation with the digital quotient model mckinsey digital quotient catlin et al acquires a more precise understanding of the digitalization challenge faced by companies and their digital performance and points out four lessons think carefully in the strategy that is available success depends on the ability to invest in relevant digital capabilities that are well aligned with the strategy and to do so to scale while technical capabilities are crucial a strong and adaptable culture can help compensate for the lack of them and align organizational structures talent development funding mechanisms and key performance indicators kpis with the digital strategy they have chosen the digital transformation index berger that evaluates the digital maturity of sectors and businesses by measuring the ability of companies to obtain benefits from the digital transformation which requires skills and capabilities in four key areas identify and evaluate current developments and trends in the digital economy get possible efficiency gains in the mo existing commercial property identify changes disruptive in the company s own business model and based on this define new business models and initiate a comprehensive change in the corporate culture to give the necessary implementation steps mmtd focused on industry the industry readiness model for german companies lichtblau et al the maturity model for industry readiness and maturity schumacher et al simmi systems integration maturity model industry leyh et al the acatech industrie maturity index schuh et al and industry readiness lichtblau et al examine the readiness for industry the will and capacity of companies to implement the ideas behind industry provide a means to establish the maturity stage current industry situation of companies and identify concrete measures to help them reach a higher stage of maturity but focused on maximizing benefits analysis of the degree of maturity of the digital transformation of an organization economical they allow companies to classify their it systems environment with a focus on the requirements of industry and seek to expand the technological focus dominant of the maturity models developed by including organizational aspects evaluated from a technological organizational and cultural perspective focusing on the business processes of companies in confirmation of this is the digital transformation report schäfer et al aimed at classifying organizations into five levels of digital transformation according to the dimensions strategy leadership products operations culture people government and technology the model of digital maturity hellge et al whose measurement of maturity provides basic knowledge about the situation of medium sized companies of the area of influence regarding the implementation of technological measures or support for digitalization stages in digital business transformation berghaus back digital maturity transformation report berghaus et al and digital maturity model berghaus et al al present the dimensions with which the digital transformation affects the organization and develop the stages of maturity based on empirical data in order to derive a typical transformation path but the second expands his analysis with the evaluation of the success rating according to the level of maturity which is why they affirm that the companies with a higher level of maturity rate themselves as significantly more satisfied on all success criteria than companies with a lower maturity level these models serve as an instrument to determine the current position and discover differences internal in the perception and the comparison with other companies in the same sector as well they are useful to plan the next steps in digital transformation mmtd focused on digital capabilities forrester s digital maturity model gill vanboskirk values capabilities basic attitudes and competencies that define a mature digital operation adapting to three scenarios general digital transformation the model evaluates the aspects fundamentals that are important for the overall digital transformation of a business such as executive support for digital strategy digital staffing how

the gap between the company s digital commercial ideals and your current digital maturity level to develop a viable plan for transformation digital allowing them to point the direction of their transformation efforts digital mmtd developed according to industrial particularity or sectorial the following models are developed from a specific industry or sector the digital maturity model for telecom ericsson telecommunications companies valdez de leon offers a vision structured approach to digital transformation that is specific to the context and challenges of the telecommunications industry and that can be used as a standard to help communications service providers to compare themselves with their peers or with themselves themselves as they advance in their transformation the

personnel in educational organizations the digital readiness index dri agostino costantini aims to assess the level of digital transformation of an organization as a whole and take the museum field as an exemplary application case the measurement instrument for multidimensional integrated model of digital transformation g rodríguez abitia bribiesca correa provides a mechanism to evaluate in institutions of higher education the state of the digital transformation and suggest the steps to follow to evolve in the transformation model and identifies the elements that must be addressed to evolve and improve the pr occident however items can be customize for particular contexts in terms of industry size or other environmental differences to better adapt to the needs of organizations under evaluation the new digital maturity model for bb project sales voss et al analysis of the degree of maturity of the digital transformation of an organization model that has been developed in the bb context to support decisions appropriate strategies for digital transformation based on an analysis of the state current of the company mmtds developed for application without distension industrial or sectoral in contrast to these models the digital readiness assessment dra kpmg wallner kpmg offers a valid and tailored instrument to any company for a rapid and effective implementation of the

and the digital maturity in traditional industries remane et al proposes two scales for describe the digital maturity of a company first the impact that the digital transformation in a specific company secondly the preparation of the company to master the changes that are coming and verify the usefulness of this measure of two scales by empirically deriving five groups or clusters of digital maturity the organizational agility maturity model gunsberg et al and the company readiness evaluation for digital business transformation isaev et al are models that provide a solution to the problem of evaluating the preparation of the it department for digital business transformation through the development of a quantitative assessment of the maturity level of the it department s processes to meet the needs of the company the first is specifically a model benchmark required to measure the agility of the entire organization within a information services division based on the agility

digital future g c kane et al is aimed at discover how digitally maturing companies adopt digital transformation and what distinguishes them and analyze the nature of the gap between companies that mature digitally and early stage companies and how companies mature they continue to move forward the digital future readiness transformation model schlaepfer et al also aligns with this direction since it reflects the level of preparation of industrial and consumer companies for the digital future and focuses on the extent to which the manufacturing location is suitable for the digital age the key skills that digitalization requires and the transformations that will be essential for companies that wish to position themselves as prepared for the future likewise the maturity model for assessing the digital readiness of manufacturing companies dreamy de carolis et al focuses on answering the question are manufacturing companies ready to go digital by offering a tool to answer it using a maturity assessment method to measure the digital readiness of manufacturing companies based on inspiring principles of the cmmi capability maturity model integration framework the transformation of the sector manufacturing towards industry sets the stage for a great industrial change according to this panorama the maturity assessment for industry colli et al provides a new digital maturity assessment approach digital maturity assessment which is based on the problem based learning pbl model and responds to a need to accompany various companies in their digital

s digital customers the development of digital business options for tomorrow based on this knowledge the implementation of these new business options and organizational integration and analysis of the degree of maturity of the digital transformation of an organization the use of these new business options the formative measurement model model for digital maturity rossmann conceptualizes and measures digital maturity focused on three research questions how is the digital maturity construct what capabilities are incorporated in the concept of digital maturity and how can companies measure digital maturity aligned and complementary with the dimensions mentioned consequently the digital maturity model from tm forum deloitte newman and the deloitte digital maturity model anderson william are used to provide a snapshot of the business identify possible investment priorities and manage the journey itself step by step towards digital transformation and allow business leaders to assess where they are on their transformation journey create goals and plans both in the short and long term and make positive impact investments for this in the colombian case the maturity model for digital transformation emerges mintic innpulsa colombia acevedo that measures the degree of adoption technological and creates a new one related to the organizational capacity to manage the transformation which is presented in the model with the incorporation of the elements soft called enablers which are transversal conditions to develop digitization mmtds designed with reference framework approach as a framework of reference we have the structuring digital transformation framework gimpel et al which is a holistic framework of fields of action for the digital transformation that leads to reasoning about it in a structured way and not only provides information about the digital transformation in the organization but also also highlights some general implications for strategic planning and takes

digital maturity and the key factors of chapter digital transformation with the perception that organizations must adapt to the rapid advances in the digital environment and shift your focus from digital transformation to digital maturity mmtd with maturity as an independent dimension the industry readiness framework ambrosio da silva et al is designed under the approach in which maturity is understood as an independent dimension among the two other dimensions organizational facilitators and technological facilitators and shows how prepared a company is to participate in an industry environment the d cube readiness model for industry felippes et al also seeks evaluate the current state of manufacturing companies in the context of the digital transformation under dimensions x organizational enabler y enabler technological and z process maturity enabler mmtd designed under the determination model capability and software process improvement the digital transformation capability maturity model dx cmm gökalp martinez was developed under a holistic and integrated approach applicable in all sectors based on a well established process capability maturity model determination of capacity and improvement of software processes software process improvement and capability determination model spice and aims to optimize the digital transformation competencies of the organization in a structured way as consequence of the assessment of the existing level of capacity maturity and provide a comprehensive roadmap for improvement another model that is based on capacity determination and software process improvement model software process improvement and capability determination model spice is the dx self assessment maturity model dx samm haryanti et al is designed to guide to organizations by providing a broad roadmap to improve maturity digital with the development of maturity measurement dx samm contributes to the sustainability of the organization by proposing digital transformation strategies for the future based on current maturity achievements analysis of the degree of maturity of the digital transformation of an organization comparison of maturity models digital transformation table presents the dimensions and method of calculating maturity for each mmtd being the two most representative characteristics when describing them the first to determine what is going to be evaluated and analyzed in the model and the second to indicate the procedure for its application and obtaining the maturity level of the mmtd were marked in pink because they did not have the definition of their method of calculating maturity of digital transformation in the articles corresponding to its publication in relation to the evaluation dimensions

that the model with the highest total score equivalent to four points highlighted in color purple is the model aligning the organization for its digital future by g c kane et to the which was applied in the organization on for measuring the maturity of digital transformation analysis of the degree of maturity of the digital transformation of an organization chapter summary as a result of this chapter the methods measurement models were characterized of the maturity of the digital transformation identified from the rsl to comply with specific objective one based on this characterization it was possible to know particularities of the mmtd that allowed a study of the models of maturity by dimensions and method of calculating maturity and classify them as sample below mmtd precursors mmtd with an economic focus on digital transformation mmtd focused on industry mmtd focused on digital capabilities mmtd developed according to industrial or sectoral particularity mmtd developed for application without industrial or sectoral detention mmtd aimed at comparing digitally mature companies with those that are no and define key success factors mmtd that manage a gap analysis based on the current state and the ideal mmtds designed with reference framework approach mmtd with maturity as an independent dimension mmtd designed under the spice model the maturity model selection process resulted in the choice of the model aligning the organization for its digital future by g c kane et al to be applied in measuring the maturity of the digital transformation aligning the model organization for its digital future the objective of this chapter is to describe on the one hand the maturity model of digital transformation mmtd selected and on the other the settings made for its subsequent application in the organization under study therefore the chapter has section in which the dimensions are presented maturity levels and questionnaire structure of the selected mmtd section showing the adjustment made to the mmtd selected to apply and section with the chapter summary digital transformation maturity model aligning the organization for its digital future to understand the challenges and opportunities associated with using social business and digital mit sloan management review in collaboration with deloitte developed a annual survey of executives managers and business analysts from organizations across the world which gave way to mmtd aligning the organization for its digital future by g c kane et al focused on carrying out measurements such as digital maturity level of the organization anticipate the interruption prepare properly the biggest threat your company faces as a result of the digital trend percentage of professionals who want to leave their organization in less than a year given digital trends most important technology for the organization today analysis of the degree of maturity of the digital transformation of an organization ion the organization s digital strategy is early developing or mature percentage of respondents who agree strongly agree rating of the company culture on a scale of to how companies strengthen their digital innovation capabilities most important skill an organizational leader must have to be successful in a digital workplace talent needs vs attraction capacity dimensions of digital transformation maturity to navigate the complexity of digital business companies must adopt the that g c kane et al called digital congruence culture people structure and tasks aligned with each other so that executives can effectively address the challenges of a constantly changing digital landscape culture accept risk getting an organization to accept risk goes beyond warnings that taking risks is acceptable organizations that mature digitally incorporate risk taking into the fabric of how they manage g c kane et al people deepening the company s skills companies that mature digitally are more than five times more likely to provide employees with opportunities to develop digital skills necessary than early stage companies early stage companies on the contrary they depend on consultants and contractors although this may be a means excellent at supporting efforts from the beginning relying solely on help external should only be a provisional measure g c kane et al the talent shortage will continue to grow and employees and executives who do not feel those who acquire digital skills will look for this elsewhere therefore the digitally maturing organizations do more than offer training courses with the increasing pressure to perform and the accelerated pace of change brought about by digital technology the most powerful way to learn is not to access what others people already know but rather encourage the creation of new knowledge through chapter practice in the workplace itself rather than in a training room g c kane et al figure digital congruence digital transformation maturity dimensions source taken from g c kane et al structure adaptive and agile hierarchical leadership structures were designed for complex organizations in more stable times to become more agile and foster collaboration some large organizations simplify their structures and turn to cross functional teams to become more agile and let formal structures fade into a background or disappear completely this is accompanied by the fact that leaders can establish high level guidelines that can then be applied by local units and functions to adapt ideas to your problems more and needs g c kane et al tasks contingent workforces and customized work the complex and lengthy selection and background check processes permanent and temporary jobs will not be able to keep up with all the needs of talent in rapidly changing environments often the best talent is not located within the four walls of an organization and not everyone looks for fixes analysis of the degree of maturity of the digital transformation of an organization traditional employment a growing field of companies are adapting to these trends and provide access to selected independent talent who are accessed as a service that connects and plays with the work of the organization and the hiring processes g c kane et al the challenge is having the right person with the right skills in the right place at the appropriate time that allows the effectiveness of the organization here they come to play factors of work organization in accordance with the capabilities of the company which meet your specific needs supported by suitable human talent and eliminating unnecessary activities within processes and procedures g c kane et al strategy leading into the future evolving to compete in an increasingly digital world is not just about implement more and better technologies it involves aligning the company s organization with the demands of the digital environment by increasing risk appetite investing in digital opportunities for your employees optimize organizational structures to achieve agility and rethink how and by whom work is done only when these factors organizational organizations come together the company can go from being digital to being transformed digitally however as these factors are not aligned the efforts of digitalization can do little to improve a company s ability to compete in a digital world even if the technology investment and implementation are correct g c kane et al nadler tushman spearheaded the idea of organizational congruence as main ingredient for optimal corporate performance the concept is that only when the essential components of a business its culture people structure and tasks are closely aligned the company can achieve powerful results g c kane et al in an ever changing digital landscape the concept of congruence takes on a new meaning and relevance since many companies do not they ensure that all elements of the organization work together over time as much as possible that does not favor the integration of your digital strategy with that of the business chapter digital transformation maturity levels g c kane et al defined three levels of digital transformation maturity early developing and maturing with based on a scale of rating from to in which it is evaluated that both the company is considered as a ideal organization transformed by digital technologies and capabilities that improve processes attract talent across the organization and drive new business models that generate value where not close means that the study company is not for nothing or very little similar to this ideal organization and very close that the company study is very similar or equal to this ideal organization see figure in more detail about the maturity levels for this model it is considered that the digitally maturing companies closely link their digital strategies with the overall strategy of their company and also have a longer term vision of strategy compared to early stage companies g c kane et al regarding culture there are three different mentalities that are closely related with the stages of digital maturity the first mentality is common among early stage digital organizations and is characterized by a low appetite for risk a hierarchical leadership structure work done in silos and decisions based more in instinct than in data on the contrary the cultural mentalities that relate closely to companies that mature digitally value the experimentation and speed accept risk and create leadership structures distributed additionally they encourage collaboration and are more likely to use data in the decision making in the middle are the cultures on the way from the first group to the third g c kane et al talent development is an important element of the culture in organizations that mature digitally who place a decisive emphasis on developing existing talent and recruit new talent while early stage companies are more likely to resort to contractors and consultants g c kane et al companies that mature digitally are significantly more capable of attracting new talent based on their use of digital in contrast to early stage organizations which tend to rely on external parties to support your digital efforts as a result it generates a talent gap for early stage companies although these companies need digital talent to help them advance digitally their lack of progress restricts their ability to attract that talent g c kane et al analysis of the degree of maturity of the digital transformation of an organization figure digital transformation maturity levels source own elaboration adapted from g c kane et al digitally maturing organizations provide the resources and opportunities so your employees thrive in a digital environment by developing employees for the success in digital environments business leaders are placing more emphasis on skills of change than in technological knowledge g c kane et al digitally maturing companies also value leadership knowledge technology is not the most important skill that leaders must have the ability to leading a company through business model change is the most important and being a forward thinking progressive is almost as important with a clear vision solid strategy and foresight according to g c kane et al structure of the maturity model questionnaire digital transformation the maturity model quiz aligning the organization for its digital future by g c kane et al in english contains questions regarding digital transformation and questions on demographics and characterization of the organization which are designed to obtain trends by industrial sectors chapter in the mmtd characterization sheet in annex a table there is information additional information on the maturity model adjustment of the maturity model digital transformation aligning the organization for its digital future the questionnaire described in section was adjusted in spanish language latin american and the same content questions were maintained but they reduced the demographic classification and characterization questions to because those that aim to outline the comparison between types of companies and sectors likewise the terms of company by entity were changed industry by sector partners by allies business models by business models between others and the people dimension to human talent to seek more clarity and understanding for the population to be surveyed see figure figure setting the selected mmtd questionnaire survey source self made table in annex b presents the changes made to the questionnaire of the selected mmtd survey of digital business executives aligning the analysis of the degree of maturity of the digital transformation of an organization organization for its digital future as it was decided to call said consultation tool and information collection another crucial modification that was made to the original questionnaire was to group the questions according to the dimension of the mmtd to which they refer strategy tasks culture human talent and structure see figure since we wanted to have a simpler analysis of the tabulated information and be able to design recommendations according to the organization that strengthen each dimension delimited by the mmtd to achieve success in the transformation process digital figure framework aligning the organization for its digital future source adapted from g c kane et al this is how in table the questions were left with the

institutional functions plans and requirements and current legal regulations implement computer security in accordance with standard policies and requirements established in current legal regulations support the development and maintenance of the integrated institutional management system and follow their recommendations figure process map of the organization under study source taken from the organization s internal document analysis of the degree of maturity of the digital transformation of an organization in this outline of the organization under study the fact stands out that within the information technology management process map is not yet found and communications as it is in the construction stage see figure this is conflictive because the process is not considered within the management system of the entity results of the application of the model digital transformation maturity the level of maturity of the digital transformation achieved by the organization targeted study is segregated with one of the respondents placing him in early five in development and six in maturing however those who consider their entity as an organization that matures digitally they granted it the lowest score of this level that is the entity for them is just beginning its maturation stage which places the organization more towards a maturity of the digital transformation in development figure maturity level of digital transformation in the organization under study source self made the positioning of the organization under study in the third level of maturity of the digital transformation is supported by the remaining results achieved in the application of the instrument that are specified by dimension of the mmtd and that are definedchapter in subsequent sections remember that participation was only obtained of of the target population which gives an idea of the phenomenon but as it is obviously it does not represent the entire organization and is not generalizable to all companies in the sector of this type results current status of the strategy dimension nine of those surveyed consider that their digital strategy entity is relatively clear and coherent and three of the respondents did not they have knowledge about the clarity and coherence of the digital strategy respondents do not consider or do not know that the following objectives make part of your entity s digital strategy d this way improve the experience and citizen commitment two people increase efficiency one person increase innovation two people improve decision making decisions a person fundamentally transform the processes and or the business model of the entity one person seven people from the officials in charge of supervising managing the digital strategy are found at the hierarchical level only two of those surveyed consider that the leadership of the entity has sufficient knowledge and capacity to lead the digital strategy only one of the respondents totally disagrees in considering that the employees have sufficient knowledge and ability to execute the strategy digital of our organization three of the participants consider that the projection period for the execution of the digital strategy in the organization must be less than or equal to two years and eight respondents think it should be between to years only three of those surveyed consider that the digital strategy is part integral to the general strategy of your entity results current status of the tasks dimension four of those surveyed do not consider that digital technologies will change or they will be disruptive for their sector to a large extent analysis of the degree of maturity of the digital transformation of an organization the total number of respondents do not consider that their entity prepares appropriately for the disruptions expected to occur in your sector due to digital trends among the barriers that prevent the entity from taking advantage of digital trends are you have to eight people think there are too many priorities in competence a person considers it to be a lack of understanding of management a person considers it to be a lack of organizational agility a person believes there are too many digital trends a trend has not landed when more and new trends are already emerging the most important specific technologies for the entity this year are agreement with three people for analytics four people for cloud one person for social one person the internet of things iot three people security one person the educational content the most important specific technologies for the entity in the next to years according to six people analytics one person cloud two people security two people cognitive technologies ai and one person educational content two of the respondents consider that the demand for products or services your entity s main assets increase or decrease due to digital trends in the next years will remain the same eleven of those surveyed consider that it is very likely that their entity develop new core business lines in the next to years in response to digital trends ten of the enc ustates agree that their entity has established more and or strong relationships with external allies as a result of trends digital seven of the officials surveyed consider that the work style of their entity is closer to the collaborative type and two of the officials surveyed consider that the work style of their entity is closer to the type independent siloed chapter results current status of the culture dimension three of the respondents agree that their risk appetite desire organization is characterized more as daring exploratory and three others do so considered as cautious risk averse only three of the officials surveyed agree that their organization is characterized as agile quick to act two of the officials surveyed think that their organization s passion for work is working to live ten of the officials surveyed agree that the your organization s digital capabilities differentiate you from other business entities public character ten of those surveyed agree that their entity implements actively initiatives to change their culture to be more collaborative responsive risk free and agile in response to digital trends results current status of the human talent dimension only one of the respondents strongly agrees that his organization gives you the resources or opportunities to develop skills to thrive in a digital environment ten of those surveyed expect their organization to help them develop skills to thrive in a digital environment eleven of those surveyed consider that it is important to work for a organization that is digitally enabled or is a digital leader given digital trends survey participants want to work in your organization for less than year according to one person to years according to two people to years according to two people to years according to one person more than years according to two people and four people do not know only eight of the officials surveyed agree that their organization needs a significantly new or different talent pool to compete effectively in the digital economy analysis of the degree of maturity of the digital transformation of an organization only one of the officials surveyed is very sure of being able to develop the skills to thrive in a more digital work environment ten of those surveyed agree that the adoption of digital by part of its entity attracts new talents results current status of the structure dimension seven of the respondents characterize the leadership structure of their organization as hierarchical only seven of those surveyed would characterize their decision making data driven organization and four of respondents would characterize the taking your organization s decision making process between data driven and instinctive only six of those surveyed consider that their entity is at closer to being an ideal organization transformed by technologies and digital capabilities that improve processes involve talent throughout the organization and promote new and value generating business models and three of the participants consider that their entity is at a maximum of of maturity in digital transformation ten of the officials surveyed think that their entity invests in innovation capabilities to create new products and services through digital technology ten of those surveyed consider that their entity mainly strengthens the digital innovation capabilities by developing the digital capabilities of existing employees and consultants only eight of those surveyed strongly agree that the image of your entity improves due to your digital initiatives and four of the respondents neither agree nor disagree with this chapter summary as observed throughout the construction of chapter it is possible to apply the method or digital transformation maturity measurement model most appropriate to the organization through the adaptation and development of the maturity model of chapter digital transformation mmtd selected aligning the organization for its digital future by g c kane et al and their final adjusted questionnaire or the survey digital business executives aligning the organization for its digital future the which consists of questions in total adapted from the original mmtd questionnaire selected according to compliance with the organization under study in table annex b contains the questions from the original questionnaire and the changes made and it was answered by of the entity s summoned officials the tabulation of the results is contained in annex c in figure for each ask based on these results the analysis will be executed to design recommendations for improvement and achievement of your goal in the transformation process digital and it was defined that the level of maturity of the digital transformation of the organization object of study is under development it is remarkable to say that the questions according to the dimension of the chosen mmtd strategy tasks culture human talent and structure so that the analysis can be carried out more simply and correct recommendations for improvement the maturity level of digital transformation of the organization under study this chapter aims to propose recommendations to the organization to improve your level of digital transformation maturity based on the results of the application derived from this the chapter is composed of section that establishes the method followed p for the construction of the chapter section ideal state in transformation digital that was defined based on documentary analysis and interviews with the representative in td of the organization gap analysis where the improvement opportunities to reach a level of digital transformation maturity high and in accordance with the organization s digital strategy and recommendations by mmtd dimensions designed based on the gaps found in the comparison of the current state asis and desired state tobe of the organization in digital transformation for each dimension of the mmtd method to design the recommendations and give the model the functionality of being prescriptive which was discussed in section was based on the architecture of the two axis roadmap of gipuzkoa berritzen innobasque which the vertical axis reflects aspects or perspectives that are going to be analyzed and the horizontal axis determines the horizon sections that will be considered in the reflection the sections standard are three short medium and long term see figure chapter figure guidelines for roadmapping based on the mmtd dimensions source own elaboration based on gipuzkoa berritzen innobasque with this roadmapping technique a common vision of the strategy shared by different stakeholders to reach the ideal state desired and develop a perspective on each layer of the roadmap vertical axis focusing on the three basic questions that we want to answer see figure the final roadmap will reflect the path to follow from where you are today state current or asis for its acronym in english to the long term future vision that is sought build ideal state or tobe for its acronym in english where the milestones that are aim to achieve in each of the perspectives in a horizon divided into sections different in this way the design of recommendations was generated in three stages it was established a current state of the organization in digital transformation or asis td based on the information obtained with the application of the selected mmtd said asis td is it is recorded in chapter section the ideal state of the organization in digital transformation or tobe td based on documentary analysis petic process procedures regulations strategic planning etc and interviews analysis of the degree of maturity of the digital transformation of an organization made to the td representative of the organization and the initiatives that should be put in place to eliminate the difference between these two states according to the results obtained from the gap analysis see figure this gap analysis is carried out initially for each question in the questionnaire and then consolidated for each of the dimensions d the mmtd figure method for defining chapter source self made current status in digital transformation by dimensions of the maturity model digital transformation the current status of the organization in digital transformation or asis td was obtained for each dimension based on the results of the application of the selected mmtd each one of these asis td are found in chapter in section for the dimension strategy in section for the tasks dimension in section for the culture dimension in section for the human talent dimension and in the section for the structure dimension chapter ideal state in digital transformation by dimensions of the maturity model digital transformation ideal state in digital transformation for the dimension strategy the organization wishes in accordance with strategic planning regarding digital transformation that of its collaborators and officials know their digital strategy and take ownership of it by recognizing that through compliance from this the entity will be able to achieve better standards of quality innovation agility adaptability and effectiveness in its management as well as the objectives established for fulfill it and in the strategic plan for information and communications technologies petic defines its integration with the entity s general strategy guided by the guidelines of the digital government policy that proposes a model that consists of two components ict for the state and ict for society three enablers transversal it architecture security and privacy digital citizen services to achieve the five purposes described above likewise the entity s it strategic objective is to strengthen the management of information and communications technologies ict which allows the adoption of standards and guidelines of business architecture for inclusive development sustained participatory and transparent at each of the three organizational levels to communicate supervise and manage the digital strategy transversally in the entity based on the importance of each activity carried out the other objective in this line is to enable the technology capabilities and services necessary to drive business transformations for quality education and according to the selected mmtd companies that mature digitally link their digital strategy with the general strategy and also have a longer term vision of the strategy analysis of the degree of maturity of the digital transformation of an organization ideal state in digital transformation for the dimension tasks the entity s petic is aimed at integrating and supporting the execution of the sector plan of the entity guide and accompany the entity s senior management in programming of investments in technology information and communications ologies direct actions of technology in accordance with the general strategy of the entity and its projects define the policies standards methodologies guidelines and recommendations that will allow a greater use of resources effective use of emerging technologies and use of tools allow the entity to establish needs in ict subject with this the project portfolio will be updated according to the needs and strategies proposed for the coming years evaluate how it is used the technology that the entity currently has and take advantage of the best practices of the different areas to achieve a unified approach and recognize savings opportunities and consolidation of effort the organization wishes according to the investment projects and its goal as a state entity make a new social contract with equal opportunities for social inclusion productive and political innovate and modernize the technological platform for the improvement of educational quality by recognizing digital technologies as entities of change for your sector the entity considers information and communications technologies ict as an important tool to contribute to the improvement of education its impact on the student learning is conditioned on the one hand to its use by teachers in their teaching practices and on the other at the level of pedagogical appropriation that they have of ict therefore designing models and strategies that take advantage of the advantages of ict in the use and appropriation of ict by the educational community it becomes a priority aspect for the entity according to its petic likewise some of the ict guiding principles for the entity alignment with the strategy the entity s business strategy must always be the basis for interpreting current and future needs to be resolved by ict solutions in this way the initiatives must support the objectives strategic chapter justified acquisition it acquisitions are made for valid reasons based on appropriate and continuous analysis with clear and transparent there is an appropriate balance between benefits opportunities costs and risks both short and long term ict as a strategic asset ict in the organization is welcomed as strategic assets and therefore those in charge of the it function must have the actors and organizational structure that are involved in the understanding of the needs and gaps at the central local and institutional by participating from the formulation of initiatives and their definition conceptual and logical and not only from the reception of requirements integrated information systems the articulation of information systems of the organization has a platform integrated information which supports missionary and support processes for decision making strategic tactical and operational on the other hand in line with the mmtd organizations that mature digitally have a more agile and adaptive operating perspective through workforces contingents personalized work adoption of digital trends organized work by modules where appropriate building stronger relationships with partners and organizing work around projects rather than functional silos ideal state in digital transformation for the dimension culture the organization wants to promote the educational offer in the city to guarantee access and the permanence of boys girls and young people in the educational system in its different forms levels and modalities the quality and relevance of education with the purpose to form individuals capable of living productively creatively and responsibly in community one of the guiding principles of ict for the organization is justified acquisition which states that it acquisitions are made for valid reasons based on a appropriate and continuous analysis with clear and transparent decisions there is a balance appropriate between benefits opportunities costs and risks both in the short and long term term analysis of the degree of maturity of the digital transformation of an organization in the entity potential solutions were identified with alignment to the data architectures applications and technology to consolidate the projects for the petic portfolio of the institution under the previous context for the purposes of the petic in issue the project portfolio is one of the most important results since this contains the high level conceptualization of the programs and projects whose execution and management will materialize the petic to achieve its objective the entity s integrated planning and management model mipg sets the following objectives strengthen leadership and human talent under the principles of integrity and legality as an engine for generating results of public administration streamline simplify and make the operation for the generation of goods and services more flexible services that effectively resolve the needs of citizens develop a solid organizational culture based on information control evaluation for decision making and continuous improvement the public policy of the online government strategy in colombia that began in with presidential directive of that year and continued decisively with the issuance of decree that defined the general guidelines of the strategy online government has evolved permanently in the country both in its scope towards a greater number of entities as well as in its implementation by them because more and more information technologies and communications have been become a tool par excellence to improve public management and state citizen relationship and under this guideline the entity acts in this dimension for the mmtd organizations that mature digitally value experimentation and speed accept risk and create leadership structures distributed additionally they encourage collaboration and are more likely to use data in the decision making ideal state in digital transformation for the dimension human talent the entity s strategic it objective is to strengthen the management of it technologies information and communications ict which allows the adoption of standards and business architecture guidelines for inclusive sustained development chapter participatory and transparent at each of the three organizational levels to supervise and manage the digital strategy transversally in the entity based on the importance of each activity developed the other objective in this line is to enable the technology capabilities and services needed to drive transformations for a quality education another objective set by the entity in its mipg is strengthen leadership and talent human under the principles of integrity and legality as the engine of the generation of public administration results and according to the mmtd the development of human talent is an important element of the culture in entities that mature digitally with special interest in potentiating existing talent and recruit new talent the latter based on their use of digital digitally maturing entities provide the opportunities and resources so that your collaborators thrive in a digital environment when developing employees for success in digital environments emphasize change skills beyond the technological knowledge ideal state in digital transformation for the dimension structure the organization under study conceives as a fundamental pillar for the challenges that the petic proposes to have the appropriate organization which is made up of a structure organization chart its functions and clearly defined processes the map of the entity s processes allows graphically identifying the way in which the processes of the entity according to their nature as well as the interrelation between the themselves to obtain results to achieve its purpose the entity s integrated planning and management model mipg sets the following objectives strengthen leadership and human talent under the principles of integrity and legality as an engine for generating results of public administration streamline simplify and make the operation for the generation of goods and services more flexible services that effectively resolve the needs of citizens analysis of the degree of maturity of the digital transformation of an organization develop a solid organizational culture based on information control evaluation for decision making and continuous improvement and among its guiding principles of ict ict is conceived as a strategic asset ict in the entity are considered strategic assets and therefore those in charge of the it function must have the actors and organizational structure that are involve in the very understanding of the needs and gaps at the central levels local and institutional by participating from the formulation of initiatives and their definition conceptual and logical and not only from the reception of requirements likewise for the mmtd organizations that mature digitally also value leadership the ability to lead a company through business model change is the most important skill followed by data based decision making these digitally maturing entities invest in innovation capabilities to create new products and services through digital technology with a style of distributed leadership in which decision making is quick agile and responsive adaptive without concentrating power in a few analysis of gaps by dimensions of the digital transformation maturity model gap analysis for the strategy dimension according to the results obtained in chapter section current status for the strategy dimension and compared to the ideal state of the present dimension in section shows a deficiency in the design of the company s digital strategy entity translated into lack of clarity and coherence for its officials this is not is explicitly defined in the strategic plan for information technologies and communications petic defined by the redp administrative office only reference is made to this in section and although in section of the the document in question establishes that the entity is guided by the guidelines of the digital government policy defined by the mintic there is no adoption of it at the particularities of the organization by not having a digital strategy in this way officials collaborators do not fully take ownership of the strategy digital of the entity and do not know how they can help it comply how it is develops and what are the benefits it brings to your organization chapter in section definition of the strategic it objectives within the strategic plan of information and communications technologies defines the objectives for which which the knowledge of officials in this question is evaluated however observes that the latter do not have solid knowledge and appropriation of the same evidenced by the high percentages obtained in the responses agree nor agreement nor disagree disagree and totally disagree seven of the officials in charge of supervising managing the digital strategy are they are at the highest hierarchical level of the entity which is good when recognize the digital strategy as the main driver of innovation effectiveness and quality of the organization however this is not carried to middle management and the level operational that is there is strategic planning but it is not executed in a manner transversal in the entity this is also evident in decree of july in article of functions does not talk about digital transformation ten of those surveyed consider not in their entirety or at all the directives of the entity has sufficient knowledge and capacity to lead the digital strategy which manifests a deficiency in the way the strategy is implemented and controlled digital of the entity likewise the entity s leadership is perceived as weak for this management which is supported by decree of july in article of functions there is no talk of digital transformation and therefore the professional profiles do not take into account account for the skills and knowledge related to this area eleven of those surveyed consider not entirely or not at all that the officials have sufficient knowledge and capacity to execute the digital strategy of the entity this shows a deficiency in the skills and knowledge of the officials to implement the digital strategy which is supported by the decree of july article of functions does not talk about transformation digital and therefore professional profiles do not take into account the skills and related knowledge in this area eight of the entity s officials think that to develop the digital strategy you must project a future of more than two years associated with public planning issues that are linked to the period of the government plan which is years in this way the strategy digital is defined in the medium term but in changes of government no continuity is observed management that enhances the benefits obtained in the previous period analysis of the degree of maturity of the digital transformation of an organization only three of those surveyed believe that the digital strategy is an integral part of the general strategy of your entity this due to ignorance of these or lack of clarity and coherence of the digital strategy evidenced in question one in the plan strategic information and communications technologies petic does not see the harmonization between the digital strategy and the general strategy of the entity because the first is not clearly defined in this document and harmonization is carried out superfluously gap analysis for the tasks dimension in light of the results obtained in section current state of the dimension tasks and compared to the ideal state of the dimension in section we have that only four of the officials surveyed believe that technologies digital technologies will change or be disruptive to their sector to a small or medium extent which which is worrying from the perspective that the organization manages where it recognizes these technologies as fundamental for the provision of a better service and the improvement of social conditions of the sector where its management is carried out because these do not they share the perception of the organization a latent risk for the entity is evident since all of the respondents considers that adequate preparation of your entity for the disruptions that are expected that occur in your sector due to digital trends are incomplete or does not occur or in the worst case they do not have knowledge of the situation to take a position on it an opportunity for improvement is evident for the entity as it does not have the ability to define strategic and operational priorities as answered by eight of the surveyed officials this is one of the biggest risks a company faces management by not focusing on achievable goals and the efficient use of its resources by covering more than what management capacity allows and even more in digital transformation this section gives the entity the option to integrate into its strategic planning digital specific technologies for the establishment of effective management enterprise architecture and services according to the needs and expectations of your sector as a complement the petic deals with architecture of information systems information and architecture of connectivity services that can be enrichedchapter for the present results likewise business architecture in general establishing it from the technological trends important to the entity on the other hand it must be clarified that in this dimension there was an option to place a additional technology to those stated other which is why educational content appears this is evidently not a technology which reveals a knowledge confused about what a technology is and what can be done with it on the part of some officials of the entity nine of the officials surveyed believe that the demand for the products or services your entity s core business increases or decreases due to digital trends in next years which determines the importance perceived from within to launch a digital transformation process that promotes innovation effectiveness improving the internal and external customer experience decision making assertiveness and a business model that can adapt to disruptions in the sector eleven of the officials surveyed s believe that it is very likely that their entity develop new core business lines over the next years in response to digital trends which is not reflected in the petic by not defining any type of value proposition in this field that is from strategic planning digital organization this plus is not given for the evolution of the business model of this ten of the officials surveyed agree that the entity has established more solid relationships with external allies as a result of digital trends however these are not evident in the petic nor are the strategies and policies to achieve them seven of the officials surveyed believe that their entity s work style is closer to the collaborative type because the management of the entity is proposed through processes that develop management in a transversal way but on the other hand in certain activities the hierarchical functioning established in the organizational chart where it is obtained that three of the officials surveyed agree with that the entity s work style is intermediate between independent and collaborative it is also observed that the entity has two process maps one in its petic different from the one published on its website this generated because the petic is not updated and does not receive the necessary follow up another opportunity for improvement analysis of the degree of maturity of the digital transformation of an organization along these lines is that the process map published on the entity s website which it is taken as a reference for this final master s thesis it does not contain the process of information and communications technology management and leaves out of the business perspective of the entity digital transformation however in the numeral of the petic where the other process map of the entity is presented there is a process technology ict and then in section the management process is introduced information and communications technologies which shows how disjointed is the documentation and therefore the management of the entity by not have coherence and clarity in its institutional guidelines now the entity develops project management based on standards international it standards such as togaf iso cobit but presents opportunities for improvement in resource optimization response agility and adaptability to change this as a result of the documentary analysis of the management reports of the office of information and communications technologies for the month of september and april in which non executions of scheduled activities and delays within the projects due to not having an agile governance structure in the entity and at the design level of the entity s business architecture there is a way long they must travel because they are currently under construction of the work for its construction according to the information provided by the representative in td of the organization and the document plantrabajoarquitectura v gap analysis for the culture dimension according to the results obtained in section current state of the culture dimension and in parallel with the ideal state of the dimension in section it is observed that six of respondents believe that their organization s risk appetite desire is characterized intermediate between daring exploratory and cautious risk averse evidenced on the principle of justified acquisition additionally due to the public nature of the entity it tends to be more cautious in the management of spending and its resources nine of the officials surveyed consider that to a medium or moderate extent overall its organization is characterized by being slow deliberative which means that the decision making is late and planning is non adaptive this shows the use of traditional project management methodologies which are based on strong planning throughout development and a longer life cyclechapter traditional as well as an organizational culture that is not focused on obtaining results ten of the officials surveyed think that their organization s passion for work is living to work that is they find passion in what they do however it would be necessary to analyze whether officials have equity between their professional and personal lives since they do not consider work as a means but as an end nine of the respondents strongly agree or agree that the digital capabilities of your organization differentiate them from other entities of a nature public being a leading entity and reference in the sector they are at the head of the digital transformation process of its population of interest however other organizations have presented innovations that can be replicated in this also it is presented as a latent risk that three of the respondents do not have the sufficient knowledge or criteria to take a position on the premise nine of those surveyed believe fully or partially that their entity implements actively initiatives to change their culture to be more collaborative responsive to risk and agile in response to digital trends reflected in projects and programs that are in force although these initiatives must be clearer and more coherent for all officials here the result is to highlight the level of participation of the respondents with exclusively the response of officials of the to whom the survey and the extension that was given by extending the closing time of the survey due to not having a sufficient number of shares which leads to afi sign that although the entity is in a process of digital transformation in development it is perceived as if it were exclusively the interest and commitment of the information technology office information and communications and not responsibility of the entire organization which it is also reinforced by what was reported by the td representative of the organization in regarding problems presented in the execution of ict projects gap analysis for the human talent dimension based on the results obtained in chapter section current status for the human talent dimension and in comparison with the ideal state of the present dimension in section it is evident that eight of the officials surveyed did not analysis of the degree of maturity of the digital transformation of an organization they are completely sure that their organization provides them with the resources or opportunities to develop skills to thrive in a digital environment and even more worrying is that three people in this group do not have the tools and knowledge necessary to express a position on the same premise as seen in the ideal state or tobe the entity sets some objectives to achieve however these are not are fully articulated with the human talent development area of the entity as digital transformation is considered a problem specific to the area of the office of information and communications technologies nine of those surveyed agree completely or partially that they expect their organization to help them develop skills to thrive in a digital environment at this point an opportunity for improvement is evident for the entity in incorporate the digital transformation process into your human talent area to develop competencies and skills in its officials that allow the management of the itself and the achievement of the digital strategy and objectives in addition to their officials present a provision for this based on their responses eleven of the officials who carried out the survey believe that it is very important to work for an organization that is digitally enabled or is a digital leader indicating the recognition of these towards digital transformation as a key to success organizational and highlights a strength of the entity by having collaborators interested and willing to adopt and use technology for the evolution of their process of management and that of your organization five of the officials surveyed want to work in their entity given the trends digital from to more than years which goes hand in hand with the results obtained in questions and in which the passion for the work done is evident the perception of the value they have for their entity to the extent that they provide them with the tools to thrive and expectations for growth in training but something what is striking is the uncertainty of four of the respondents who do not know why how long do they want to work at the entity given digital trends this i can be related to the results obtained in questions and in which they have doubts about whether your entity s leadership has sufficient knowledge and capacity to lead the organization s digital strategy and whether the digital capabilities of your organization differentiate them from other public entities chapter eight of those surveyed believe that their organization needs a talent pool significantly new or different to compete effectively in the economy digital which is linked to the results of the previous response where officials they may consider that their permanence in the entity will be linked to their skills and capabilities that allow them to be successful in a digital environment additionally it is it should be noted that four of the respondents do not take a position on the stated need in the statement which generates concern on the following points knowledge deficient of the subject the fear of being obsolete in a digital medium or the indifference towards the successful development of your entity eight of those surveyed are sure or very sure that they can develop the skills to thrive in a more digital work environment which is positive for the entity without however in the professional profiles these knowledge and skills must be included as requirements for them on the other hand two respondents are concerned about not being able to develop the skills to thrive in an environment of more digital work in this case there is an opportunity for improvement when designing and implement a training and education plan for human talent where there is take into account the entity s digital strategy nine of the officials surveyed agree or totally agree with which the adoption of digital by your entity attracts new talents which reaffirms the need to include knowledge and skills related to transformation digital within the professional profiles of officials as well as in the training and education plans three respondents who neither agree nor disagreement are in agreement with the four who gave the same answer in the question gap analysis for the structure dimension according to the results obtained in chapter in section current state of the structure dimension and in balance with the ideal state of this dimension in the section it is observed that seven of the respondents characterize the leadership structure of its organization as hierarchical and that presents the following opportunities for improvement technology and data must be considered a strategic factor for the entity that generates value it management in the entity ad requires comprehensive coordination between the operational strategic and missional areas that give results the information must be analysis of the degree of maturity of the digital transformation of an organization timely reliable available and be at the service of users in accordance with the transparency and integrity criteria there is a need to socialize and implement guidelines for interoperability between information systems internal and external of the entity it service solutions must be found aligned with the processes established in the entity s process map for a better use of opportunities for the use of ict according to cost benefit existence of a department responsible for it decisions from the strategic planning of the entity and definition of an organizational chart of those responsible of the it function that allows better management of ict in the entity seven of those surveyed define their organization s decision making as based in data and that has the following opportunities for improvement technology and data they must be considered a strategic factor for the entity that generates value management it in the entity requires comprehensive coordination between operational areas strategic and missional that gives results the information must be timely reliable available and be at the service of users in accordance with transparency criteria and integrity thereof robust characterization for it management processes which centralize roles activities inputs and outputs in a consolidated detailed and sufficient for the challenges in the entity need for transfer protocols knowledge and a repository that shows all the results of each it project delivered by third parties have resources and formal channels to inform about the it strategy it is pertinent to review internal and external communications initiatives in the entity six of those surveyed consider that their entity is closer of being an ideal organization transformed by digital technologies and capabilities that they improve processes involve talent throughout the organization and promote business models new and value generating businesses or if the rating is weighted the entity is located on scale which does not position the entity very well leaving it with a long way to go this was confirmed in the analysis of the previous questions and in the recommendations generated leading to a level of transformation maturity digital in development ten of the officials surveyed think that their entity is investing in innovation capabilities to create new products and services through digital technology evidenced in the projects launched by the entity althoughchapter opportunities present themselves improvement it service solutions must be aligned with the processes established in the entity s process map for better use of the opportunities for the use of ict according to the cost benefit strengthen the human team of the entity for the development of the ict use and appropriation capabilities for all the entity s stakeholders need for knowledge transfer protocols and a repository that demonstrates all results of each it project delivered by third parties have resources and formal channels to inform about the it strategy it is pertinent to review the internal and external communications initiatives in the organization update permanent catalog of the entity s information systems which includes its solution architecture definition of the internal model parameters and guidelines for the software development for the entity and implement solutions that use technologies in the cloud when applicable and that respond to performance scalability and security of the information ten of those surveyed consider that their entity mainly strengthens the digital innovation capabilities by developing employees digital capabilities existing contractors and consultants which presents a latent risk in the development of external relationships mergers and acquisitions when pigeonholed as an entity public that has no competition these are opportunities that are not explored by the organization eight of the officials surveyed

of proposing recommendations to the organization to improve its level of digital transformation maturity based on the results of the application by running a gap analysis between the current state and ideal of the organization under study these opportunities and improvement initiatives are aimed at ensuring that the level of maturity of the digital transformation of the entity improves and can go from developing maturing by attacking the critical points in each dimension of analysis of the mmtd chapter among the recommendations the one that stands out the most is the design of a digital strategy according to the strategic planning of the organization under study and its subsequent socialization to ensure its appropriation by all collaborators of the entity although in the strategic plan for information and communications technologies petic of the entity refers to it it does not define it as second key recommendation presents the design implementation and maintenance of a business architecture and in third position emphasis is placed on monitoring and update and alignment with decree of dafp conpes dnp and decree of mintic of the organization s petic since based on this the organization s digital transformation vision moves and they derive their guidelines regarding digital strategy conclusions the objective of this final master s thesis was to analyze the degree of maturity of the digital transformation of an organization which was achieved by characterizing the methods models for measuring the maturity of digital transformation based on a review of systematic literature that gave way to the description of maturity models for after the execution of the selection process define an ideal mmtd to apply in the organization under study as a result of this selection the maturity model was chosen aligning the organization for its digital future by g c kane et al this mmtd was adapted to latin american spanish and adjusted in terms of terminology and number of demographic classification and characterization questions which resulted in a survey with a total of questions that received the name survey to digital business executives aligning the organization for its digital future by applying the method or model for measuring the maturity of the digital transformation more suitable for the organization with a participation of of the target population s and places to the organization at a level of maturity of the digital transformation in development finding itself in the transition from a traditional organizational structure to one that accepts more risk encourages collaboration is more likely to use data in decision making decisions works to closely link its digital strategies with the strategy general of his company with a long term vision he strives to develop talent existing and recruit new talent based on their use of digital has begun to provide the resources and opportunities for your employees to thrive in a digital environment and its institutional leaders begin to pay attention to the change skills despite this even the entity under study must make efforts to correct the existing gaps to be an ideal organization transformed by technologies and digital capabilities that improve processes attract talent throughout the organization and promote new business models that generate value what led to propósito analysis of the degree of maturity of the digital transformation of an organization recommendations to the organization to improve its level of transformation maturity digital based on application results based on a current state analysis and the ideal state for each dimension of the mmtd the gap analysis the documentary analysis and the interviews carried out with the representative in td of the organization are tools used to complement the collection of information obtained from the application of the mmtd give the model the functionality of being prescriptive and generate a roadmap that helps the organization under study to improve your degree of progress in digital transformation additionally it was proposed a improvement for the mmtd in which the questions of its questionnaire were grouped according to the dimensions it proposes to facilitate the analysis of results and generation of recommendations among the key recommendations the definition of an appropriate digital strategy stands out to the strategic planning of the organization under study and its subsequent socialization to ensure its appropriation by all collaborators of the entity the design implementation and maintenance of an enterprise architecture and the monitoring and updating of the organization s petic since based on this moves the organization s digital transformation vision and its guidelines are derived in terms of digital strategy it is very necessary that the organization where the selected mmtd was applied conceives its digital transformation process as an extension of your strategic planning aligned with the digital government policy through decree of mintic national development plan colombia world power of life dnp as observed in the gap analysis the lack in the room ility and knowledge of its officials to implement the digital strategy this exposed to risks that management faces by not focusing on achievable goals and the efficient use of its resources by covering more than what allows achieving the management capacity and even more so in digital transformation the organization also has late decision making and its planning is is not adaptive which slows down your digital transformation process by not considering the technology and data as a strategic factor for the entity that generates value in the lack of comprehensive coordination between operational strategic and missional areas that gives results in it management and where finally the information is not beingconclusions timely reliable available and is not at all times at the service of the users in accordance with its transparency and integrity criteria however as a great strength of the entity the interest of its talent is presented human being to learn new knowledge and acquire new skills that enable them be effective in your digital environment for the improvement of your organization on the other hand it is concluded that preparing for a digital future is not an easy task means develop digital capabilities in which activities people culture and structure of a company are synchronized and aligned with a set of objectives organizational however most companies are limited by the lack of resources lack of talent and the pull of other priorities leaving executives in charge of managing digital initiatives that take the form of projects or are limited to activities within a given division function or activity or channel in a world increasingly digital digital transformation is not just about implementing more and better technologies implies digital congruence aligning culture people structure and tasks of the organization the scope of the proposed objectives was achieved by executing the descriptive study established since it was aimed at measuring the presence characteristics or distribution of the maturity of the digital transformation in the organization under study limiting to describe one or several phenomena without the intention of establishing causal relationships with other factors and without intentional manipulation only the phenomena were observed as they were as they occurred in their natural context with the combination of quantitative techniques and qualitative tests to obtain the required information which offered an idea of the level of maturity of digital transformation but as is evident it is not generalizable to all entities in the sector and does not generalize the situation of the organization object of study likewise the mmtd aligning the organization for its digital future by g c kane et al provides a comprehensive overview how digital transformation occurs within a company from its strategy culture human talent structure and tasks as well as the possibility of delimiting its objective state by defining what the conditions are of a company in digital maturation analysis of the degree of maturity of the digital transformation of an organization limitations in the development of this degree work there was a limitation regarding access to the implemented methods of various digital transformation maturity models mmtd to measure the maturity of organizations in terms of digital transformation although maturity measurement models were obtained in the rsl very few presented complete information for implementation only of mmtd had this information additionally the maturity model of selected digital transformation was only applied to one organization due to that access to these is restricted and we worked with a non probabilistic sample for convenience of a single case regarding the application within the organization under study it was also stated a lack of interest on the part of your collaborators towards the opportunity to improve their degree of success in digital transformation having a reduced participation of which does not provide the possibility of having a more complete picture of what is happening really within the organization as well as very long periods of time for respond to information requirements on average to months to provide solution to requirements necessary for the continuation of the study on the other hand the target population was not very familiar with administrative terminology regarding the business model stigmatizing the concepts of business competition customer productivity and performance only to those private companies of a nature commercial for profit and competition furthermore they have the paradigm of being a unique public entity of its kind in the region that does not have a comparative reference that makes them take advantage of opportunities for improvement with the exception of the regulations that they must comply by law the latter is clear evidence that confirms the reason for the low level of participation in this exercise contributions to the field of application as a contribution to the field of application it is expected that organizations acquire a structured and robust understanding of digital transformation and business models digital transformation maturity by designing and implementing this process based on their particular needs and aspirations conceived from a holistic and continuity of the entire entity and its organizational philosophy to change in this way the conclusions misconception about digital transformation as being a simple acquisition of new technology likewise it is expected that the methodology described here for selection and application of a mmtd provides tools and support to organizations starting or are immersed in the adventure of digital transformation contributions to industrial engineering as a contribution to industrial engineering we wish to deliver a reference study for the measurement of the level of maturity of digital transformation in which its methodology can be replicable and its results are taken as a comparative basis for other analyses jointly it seeks to deliver a broad and strongly constituted state of the art that allows a higher level of appropriation and transfer of knowledge in transformation digital it is worth highlighting that the characterization here achieved for a total of mmtd from the year to has no precedents in the literature therefore it is an instrument very useful in understanding and generating new knowledge in transformation digital likewise the expansion of the mmtd methodology is a contribution selected with the addition of gap analysis that provides the necessary roadmap to increase the degree of maturity of the organization s digital transformation as well as such as the modification that was made to the mmtd aligning collection tool the organization for its digital future by g c kane et al by grouping their questions according to the dimensions it defines which facilitate the study of its results and proposed recommendations future jobs and possible lines of investigation among the possible future works and possible lines of research are comparative study between different companies from various sectors in colombia through the mmtd application aligning the organization for its digital future by g c kane et al to analyze how the digital

marketing indicators method close cooperation with project partners and approach practice oriented methodology were based on a combination of workshops and case studies the case studies investigate a contemporary phenomenon within its real life context and is used when the boundaries between phenomenon and context are not clearly evident this methodology was chosen for this study academic because from an academic perspective the field of the indicators used to quantify the benefits of industry are a recent phenomenon that lacks clear limits since industry applications for companies the idea that it is not yet sufficiently standardized and widespread the use basic is linking well established indicators with those of the index comprises three successive stages the first stage is identification of the current maturity stage in the different areas impacts of industrie by linking the indicators with the functional stage involves the company identifying the stage of acatech

corporate strategy this implies concrete this allows companies to understand how to analyze their existing industry capabilities by area functional and structural a gap analysis is used to an improved level of maturity affects certain indicators he identify the required capabilities that are missing and that you still need indicator classification system is necessary to develop these will depend on the current stage of development evaluate the benefits of industry applications verified in stage and the objective state that the company wants reach the end of the transformation finally stage involves formulate actions and incorporate them into a roadmap with a view to performance factor develop the capabilities identified in stage production workshops to share and make use of the experience of the productivity of different members of the consortium and at the same time encourage interdisciplinary dialogue and cooperation deadlines this resulted in new cooperative ventures among the participants and allowed give on time plan and implement final master s work in a short space general effectiveness of timing systems quality factor the model approach is based on a succession of stages of maturity that is levels of development based on values that they help companies go through each stage of the transformation from the basic requirements for industry to the complete implementation since the desired goal state of a company will depend on its commercial strategy it corresponds to each company decide which stage of maturity represents the best annex a mmtd

response to changes in the environment business and in the company s strategy each structural area has two transversal principles that serve as a guide for its continuous development each principle

first we conducted a systematic review of the maturity level by phase of the literature process to collect information on the state of the research on mmd and deriving maturity dimensions sales digital for sales from literature this was followed by a exploratory single case study that aimed to specify the identified dimensions of each phase of the project sales process and generate subdimensions and analysis of the degree of maturity of the digital transformation of an organization mmtd characterization sheet characteristic items for each phase as a method of data collection qualitative interviews were used experts as part of the case study based on the identified maturity dimensions and the elements of maturity we then conceptualized a new dmm for the bb project sales to measure the digital maturity of the s individual phases in the project sales process the digital maturity model was adapted to an evaluation tool supposing that the identified subdimensions fully describe the digital maturity of the upper phase the maturity level of a phase is calculated from the arithmetic mean of the maturity levels of its subdimensions whose maturity in turn it is measured by the elements subordinate to it for each subdimension a company evaluates the extent to which the corresponding elements are implemented the elements particularly relevant for maturity digital such as the presence of vr mr tools for acquisition talks have a greater weighing in general a company can obtain a minimum of and a maximum of points in each subdimension from the arithmetic mean of the scores of the subdimensions and their subsequent rounding you can determine the maturity level of an entire phase he developed specific descriptions for the levels of phase specific maturity however due to small number of subdimensions and articles it was not possible to determine the maturity levels for the preparation and negotiation of offers furthermore the subdimensions of the first and last phase show great similarities so a measurement was not determined separate from the maturity level for the after sales phase and client retention observations the article does not present the complete

was carried out using mapping of the dimensions the level of maturity and the mm supporting documents then a determined new framework according to the results of the comparison namely comparative analysis the strategy model development was determined using the approach of iso process evaluation furthermore the selection of the percentage of achievement of the process form of presentation of the mm with base documents of maturity checklist was provided with a process of calculation and development of level of digital maturity of a computer tool to facilitate users organization access to the mm the model that had been created was then evaluated formed by obtaining expert reviews in in this study the evaluation model was applied to two different sectors namely the education sector and the transportation sector dx samm is built with seven dimensions which are described in the form of questions that are used as materials to evaluate the level of maturity the evaluation dx samm adopts an iso iec evaluation defined in international standards as nine process attributes additionally the dx samm dimension is assigned to the process so that it produces generic elements in the form of questionnaire used to assess maturity organizational the assessment of the maturity level is carried out completed by completing each element of the question based on of that group of dimensions it is necessary to understand the digital context of organizational transformation in the evaluation process so that the results obtained do not be subjective the evaluation of the attributes of the process analysis of the degree of maturity of the digital transformation of an organization mmtd characterization sheet in this document is in accordance with the standard of iso iec xx evaluation the rating

sector has evolved throughout history implementing technology increasingly in its processes everyday it is increasingly common that financial products can be requested through non face to face channels such as the internet or telephone years ago it was inconceivable that something as sensitive as money would be handled with little or no interaction between the client and an advisor this is possible today thanks to new technologies that facilitate the procedures and make it possible for safety checks are done automatically with the help of a machine traditional banks have seen forced to adapt to changes in the sector and new entrants arrive with their innovative technology proposal both share the goal of satisfying a client who is increasingly demanding and who has more and more power and financial autonomy from these changes a new type of business emerged financial technology businesses or as they are called popularly fintech the latter have a high technological component in their operations and their main advantage competitive is the freedom that the client has to manage their money these businesses have made possible the banking of a sector of the population that previously did not have access to any banking product several fintech companies introduce market products that are traditionally physical in a digital way then the concept of a digital product arises that thanks to its digital nature it allows agility in marketing a reduction in operating costs and a lower cost of sale than a physical product although there are still many people who prefer traditional products and channels the the trend to have digital products is growing more and more throughout this document we will analyze the concept of a digital bank using the banking model as a framework of reference business of nubank the world s first digital bank which was born in brazil and is founded by the colombian david vélez this analysis will help to understand the differences between the business model of a traditional bank and a digital bank besides we will analyze the case of a colombian fintech which we will call fc at the business architecture level in order to understand the first stages of creating a fintech company its motivations and expectations and align them with the market and thus carry out a consulting process for the creation of a new line of business theoretical framework business models def a business model describes the foundations on which a company creates provides and captures value osterwalder pigneur business model canvas stories strategic management tool consisting of nine creating a business model is like writing a new one modules that represent the key components of a story this story explains how the business works all organization to obtain income covering the four the new stories are based on old stories and of main areas of a business customers offer likewise new business models are infrastructure and economic viability osterwalder pigneur variations of the most primitive value chain and must be these modules are market segments designed in response to a problem many models value propositions channels customer relations fail because they wrongly assume the form of sources of income key resources activities behave of customers and try to solve a key key associations cost structure need that does not exist which leads to the business not generate income and not survive the profits in addition to being e value intrinsically important are the indicator of the success of the business oriented conceptual modeling approach business model therefore if the business model is not electronic e business designed as a tool to achieve the expected objectives it must be redesigned and define how value is created and exchanged between multiple rewrites until you meet expectations without actors three points of view must be taken into account however a good business model is not enough on its own value perspective process perspective and solo perspective a good competitive strategy is necessary which systems architecture the e value ontology contains a competitive advantage with respect to the market and concepts relationships and constraints to describe alliances can be critical to ensuring the survival of a value exchange activities that add value and are company based competitive strategy is that factor that makes in graphic representations of actors valuable objects one company being more successful than another a strategy value ports value interface inter value change strong competitive offer is achieved when you have a model that is difficult to of value market segment compound actor and activity to replicate and that changes the dogmas of an economic sector of value change models a change model is used to describe how an organization adapts in a dynamic environment to stay profitable there are four types of change models realization renewal extension and trajectory a model of realization seeks to exploit the full potential of the current business rather than a change in the model it uses strategies to optimize its operation with the same resources generally their strategies are geographic expansion and growth of the customer base a renewal model seeks to revitalize its products platforms and operations either by creating new products or services or developing new capabilities and attacking new markets an extension model seeks to expand industries to monopolize new unexplored market segments functions and operations existing product lines are not changed but rather they add new ones which means the business model generally becomes broader a trajectory model means a new business model this drastic change is a response to a drastic change in the environment these changes are crucial for the survival of a company over time business models on the web a business model is a method of doing business with which manufacturer allows a manufacturing company a company sustains itself that is it generates profits connect directly with a buyer and thus cut internet commerce opens the doors to the creation of new steps in the value chain business models but also to the reinvention of models already affiliation alliances between sites in order to increase existing some basic business models are then defined sales and visibility profits depend on the intermediation it allows facilitating transactions between effectiveness that the affiliate has and can be taken to buyers and sellers the revenue stream consists of either exchanging advertising measured by frequently charging a commission for click transactions or charging a commission for sales carried out community this business model is based on advertising generates value by charging a fee for formation of a group of people with interests display a specific website or brand common which is sustained with voluntary contributions and with infomediary generates value through the use of data from loyalty among users clients this data goes through an analysis process subscription periodic collection of a fee in exchange for to recognize patterns and consumption habits and create a service personalized marketing campaigns utilities model that is based on the collection of a merchant wholesale or retail sales of products rate proportional to the consumption of a service atomic e business models value creation a business model represents the design of the content atomic models are a conceptual framework of reference structure and governance of a transaction to create value to understand the complexity of electronic business through the exploitation of business opportunities he these can be used as pure types to describe the content of a transaction refers to the goods or essence of an electronic business model as information that is exchanged and the resources and combinations of atomic models and also how capabilities that are required to enable sharing the decompositions to further understand the logic of a structure of a transaction refers to the parties that business there is also an important concept called participate in the exchange and the way in which they are business initiative this initiative is composed of relate also includes the order in which it is carried atomic business models channels customer segments i finished the process the governance of a transaction refers to and it capabilities and infrastructure there are atomic models the way the flow of information resources and goods are that are compatible with other models and that merging them controlled by the participating parties also takes into account create a successful initiative however to ensure the account for legal issues and incentives for participants success they must be aligned with the needs of the companies then create value using as customer segment that is being attacked and the tool the business model therefore the value is equal to it infrastructure needed to implement those the sum of all values created by all actors in atomic models otherwise the initiative is intended all business model transactions failure business model functions a business model functions as a framework to integrate internal and external elements of a company in order to obtain economically favorable results the functions of a business model are to articulate the value proposition identify market segments define the value chain structure estimate the cost structure and revenue potential describe its position in a value network and formulate the competitive strategy the process to design a business model consists of defining a value proposition that solves a problem with a defined product the way the customer would use it and how big that is problem for the client the market segment depends on the problem that the value proposition solves and they are the ones that are willing to pay to solve that problem the value chain is extremely important because n or is it enough to create value but with creating value to such a point that the company manages to obtain a profit margin and thus guarantee its survival after having defined the previous points an income architecture must be designed which is the blueprint to follow for the flow of money in the company company that is defining how the client will pay how the suppliers will be paid and thus having a defined structure for guarantee profitability finally competitive strategy is that different and difficult to replicate factor that makes a company more successful than another case study nubank fintech are companies that base their services on financial technology new technologies such as blockchain allow each more and more people trust fintech to manage something as sensitive as money with the passage of time and the rise of technology several business models have emerged in this area the main and most common ones are loans a disruptive way to get loans consumer banks companies that offer services fintech under this modality lend money directly to traditional banks savings accounts or credit cards or customers generally use prepaid cards more easily and with interest with the difference that these services have lower than a bank which increasingly makes them have a high digital component and are more accessible to bank people prefer to use these companies to a part of the population that does not have the opportunity with payments this model changes the way people traditional banks make payments to other people or businesses allows capital financing they seek to facilitate financing easy transactions at any time of companies either connecting them with potential investors or personal finances they offer the client advice with crowdfunding personalized for your finances and management budget nubank is a financial technology company that was founded on may by the colombian david vélez the brazilian cristina junqueira and the american edward wible with the intention of revolutionizing financial services in brazil at just years old of operation is already established in brazil as the fifth largest bank despite not having any branches nubank is a digital bank which does not charge user fees and where procedures can be completed in half the time in a traditional bank traditional bank vs digital bank before describing the business model of our case study we will highlight the differences between a traditional bank and a digital bank this will help us understand the phenomenon of fintech and the digital transformation of banks money has traditionally been a physical good which originated in order to unify the transactions carried out by the man from the beginning of his history without however money has also been evolving and is becoming less and less necessary possess it physically to make transactions the technology available today allows money as a digital product enabling transactions to be carried out more easily portfolio of services the services offered by digital banks are essentially object of the type of the same that a traditional bank offers the difference lies in business business service business client these are generally digital or can be requested by customer digital channels in general a bank offers three services s issue cards credit card person credit cards savings checking accounts and debit cards and issue account and customer account bank s loans there are banks whose service portfolio is more persona savings debit card wide and offer investment services or rewards accounts customer s offer loan money by purchases but the most important products are the person mentioned above business structure the graph above shows the business structure of a traditional bank with respect to the digital bank the structure is as follows in the same way however the concept of a branch is eliminated and changed to digital channels whether a mobile application or a web page it should also be noted that the fact that a bank is digital does not mean that it does not have a money deposit this deposit can be physical or digital business model

businesses to adapt or die it is increasingly common for traditional banks to create strategies with a high technological component to maintain their clients and prevent them from migrating to fintech alternatives it is also worth highlighting that fintech they enter the market with attractive conditions for the client as in the case of nubank and fc which do not charge commissions to the client for managing their money contrary to what happens with traditional banks another phenomenon to take into account the main thing is that fintech makes products more accessible to all sectors of the population reducing the barriers to entry requested by a traditional bank and simplifying procedures thus increasing the rate of banking of the population fc despite entering the business recently already has recognition and a large user base seeks become a digital bank and for this it is launching pr oducts once a year future work is then the consulting process for the development of your next product which will be a virtual wallet the end the last of this is for this virtual wallet to function as a savings account and thus begin to offer the products offered by a bank finally we can conclude that new business models emerge from existing models in the present the new business models that emerge have a high technological component and even depend on the technology to function as is the case of uber or airbnb for this reason we can say with complete certainty that the financial sector in the not too distant future will depend on technology as happened with the advertising or entertainment and even the figure of cash will be eliminated references osterwalder a pigneur y business model generation a handbook for visionaries game changers and challengers john wiley sons

annually for an initial three years the funding decision for this first einstein research unit is a milestone for the interdisciplinary research landscape in berlin says prof dr ing dr sabine kunst president of humboldt universität zu berlin and spokesperson for the bua in this way the berlin university alliance supports excellent research in the long term in an area that is highly relevant to our society today and in the future quantum computers are considered one of the key technologies of the st century with them scientists hope to solve computational problems that cannot be solved nowadays even with supercomputers the continued development of quantum computers also holds great potential for the economy only the technological progress of recent years has made it possible to build the first prototypes of such quantum computers unlike classical computers they handle information based on quantum mechanical laws this means that memory contents on these computers can at the same time contain multiple superimposed values on which computing instructions have a simultaneous effect the research team led by prof dr jens eisert physicist and mathematician at free university

surreyintroduction as changing user needs and advancing mobile broadband is only one of these three technologies lead to the evolution of a more capabilities the other two are ultra reliable diverse and complex ecosystem centred on and low and guaranteed latency communications this project will focus on communications urllc and massive machine understanding how an effective and efficient type communications mmtc in support of governance system needs to evolve internet of things iot mobile broadband the discussion below is organised around a standard is now complete and g equipment series of key questions as follows and services being deployed globally this mobile broadband capability is mainly to what challenges will the roll out of g and address capacity crunch that is being faced in the emergence of new use cases in different g due to huge demand in mobile broadband vertical sectors and the involvement of new for data the roll out of mobile broadband is players create delayed by years in the uk mainly due to the what can we learn from the successes and restrictions imposed by government on high failure of g and g governance in the past risk vendors hrv in the uk this delay is what are the lessons can draw from the rapid estimated to be to years with cost of development and huge success in terms of replacing g and g equipment being in order usage and value creation of the internet of b to mobile network operators mno what does it tell us about the advantages and associated to this cost is loss of revenue from disadvantages in terms of the rate of g which is exacerbated by covid to tune innovation access security privacy etc of of b in the uk in lost opportunities uncontrolled development versus regulation consequence of the ban has many implications on which governance areas is it useful or on mnos business in addition to slowing down even essential for government to focus if we in roll out of g one impact is option limitation are to develop an effective and efficient in pool of equipment vendors which is reduced next generation ecosystem to effectively only two major ones that are ericsson and nokia to meet the global demand what governance areas are best addressed other negative implications are same as supply by industry organisations and initiatives and demand like any market that can increase what aspects should be left to emerge from cost and impair after sales quality of service the operation of the market and support this restriction does not only what would an ideal digital governance impact g equipment it affects mnos who have system look like assuming global cooperation g equipment from hrv as well g is initially were possible deployed as non standalone network meaning g radio g radio and g core are needed to be deploye d together however g equipment what challenges will the roll out of g from one vendor cannot be easily used to and the emergence of new use cases in support g equipment from another vendor different vertical sectors and the both g and g equipment have to be from the involvement of new players create same vendor in handling interoperability and g offers three distinct capabilities in addressing integration problems as most legacy g system societal and industry current needs and in are from huawei that means deployment of g support of a range of possible future use cases first requires replacement of huawei g https publications parliament uk pa cm cmselect cmdfence htm https drive google com file d hhdptr djkzurvdzgyfbeixfax ocjlw view https eandt theiet org content articles g rollout delay could cost the uk billions report says digital industry governance and g equipment with that of another vendor and small companies to participate in global this will further delay deployment of g supply ecosystem however oran technology is networks and g services offering with huawei far from being ready for mass deployment being barred from some markets and leaving in terms of performance in capacity limited ericsson and nokia as the main options to fill in environment such as in urban area current the gap in market question is would these two oran solutions performance is by far less than vendors have sufficient delivery capacity to meet that of g making oran when is available the market demand and whether their products only suitable for less capacity demanding are mature enough with at least similar environments such as suburban areas performance and cost as that of huawei this will be the case until high capacity oran is developed which will not be the case to minimise the impact of dependency on few before diversification of supply chain vendors governments and mobile network requires open and standardised interfaces to operators mno are rightly in favour of facilitate integration and interoperation of diversification of supply chain and support open different sub system solutions from different radio access network oran architecture vendors to be developed and integrated in a where different companies can provide different complete oran architecture aspects of radio access network this brings about huge opportunities for many more large figure oran generic architecture from o ran alliance from reference https www o ran org digital industry governance and goran architecture is based on many open managed by mnos but a network slice is interfaces as can be seen in figure compared exclusively allocated for a specific enterprise with traditional closed ran however the for industrial applications g is best deployed in greater the number of open interfaces the more form of stand alone g network this means architecture is prone to network security and tha t they do not need being complemented with risks of interoperability between different g network a stand alone g network is a products from different vendors another factor complete end to end g technology consisting of that contributes to g roll out delays is that for a g new radio gnr and g core service non standalone network nsa as is current based architecture sba g core sba is option for g rollout the market needs oran flexible for easy upgrades with future functions products for both g ran as well as g ran and future services through virtualisation of functions and separation between functions in both urllc and mmtc are incorporated in g software and underlying hardware platform specifications by design for efficient support stand alone g in form of public wide area and of vertical sectors and industrial applications private non public is yet to be developed for they are to support many devices machines commercial use thus stand alone capability is and sensors of different capabilities as well as one of the technical reasons for delay in the mission critical applications where reliability adoption of g in vertical industries and or low latency connectivity is required in industrial settings other reasons for delay in g roll out are the fact that for industrial applications where guaranteed these capabilities can support different low latency is essential for time critical use cases deployments of g network namely stand alone the urllc aspect of g is yet to be available and non standalone and in the form of private commercially moreover further research and networks public networks or a combination of standardisation is required for high capacity private and public networks or hybrid urllc which is a subject of study in release deployment private network is strictly under of g that may not be completed before full control of a vertical industry whereas public september as shown in figure network is managed by mnos for wide area mobile broadband hybrid networks are mainly figure standard roadmap for g and beyond digital industry governance and g for mass connectivity again the standardisation private network is deployed without cellular work is in progress in the release of gpp operator service provider the second scenario these are mainly technical and standardisation private g is the chosen path by some issues that have contributed to g deployment industries mainly because of network and data delay from non technical points of view security where company data and intellectual industrial use of g is mainly a business to properties are important however as such business bb model issue between mnos and industries do not have appropriate skills in vertical enterprises for the hybrid deployment telecom network operation and management g deployment whether in form of private or the barrier is to have people with such skill sets hybrid needs appreciation of g network which are fundamentally different from people capability as well as a compelling business case with it skills the use of digital twins provides by vertical industries on g impacts on their some insight in the network operation and cost saving and or new source of revenue identify through appropriate alarms point s and enhancement in their productivity of failure or anomaly in traffic behaviour those vertical industries that have publicly digital twin solutions for vertical non telecom announced their strategy in adopting private industries is therefore an important missing g deployment justify their case by putting technology to give peace of mind to vertical high importance in the first place on their industry in embracing g as a connectivity requirements on stringent network security platform and reliability of operation of better than in the scenario of bb a cellular network of time as well as on being in control provider mno could offer support and of their own business data maintenance and provide a secure network slice additionally lack of necessary skills in network capacity to a business network slicing management and operation of private g in technology is subject of standardisation and is non telecom industry is another factor that has yet to be developed by equipment vendors for hindered adoption of g some of these points commercial use however for this business are further elaborated on in the following model to become acceptable a win win sections business model needs to be in place between mobile service providers and other industry sectors so that verticals can appreciate cost what challenges will the roll out of g savings and or increase in revenue in adopting and the emergence of new use cases in g system this will happen over time but will different vertical sectors and the take some time as verticals need to appreciate involvement of new players create and understand importance of g connectivity g is different from previous generations of to their business productivity and costs mobile wireless systems in the sense that its these are some good lessons to learn from the innovative capabilities are designed for use in way g standardisation was conducted from industry environment to improve productivity the beginning the verticals should have been through automation reliability and low and involved with the telecom sector in identifying guaranteed latency in connectivity g is more their specific requirements and in development about connecting machines or internet of things of standards vertical industries examples are iot than connecting people as was the case health manufacturing automotive logistics with previous generations and so on of course all these use cases need to for vertical industry use cases jury is still out on have clear business cases an important and a win win business model for stake holders in a enabling factor in adoption of any new bb arrangement or when g non public or technology some of requirements from vertical https www gpp org news events rel _newtimeline digital industry governance and gindustries are security latency reliability networks are also under tight control of mobile resilience and interoperability with legacy it network operators that ensure user identity system privacy and data security global standard facilitates global market and due to this to help with faster adoption of g technologies economy of scale enables fast return on and establishment of common understating investment innovation in mobile networks are more joint technology and use case trials need mainly in technology whereas innovation in to be conducted between actors from different internet is in applications and contents sectors it is not too late to do so as future development of g standards in release and g unlike previous mobile generations with the possibly and are about industrial g use purpose of connecting people is a solution to societal and industrial challenges in the to cases and its autonomous operation period it is about connecting machines of different sizes and capabilities g integrates a what are the lessons can draw from the number of services from different industries into rapid development and huge success in one unified architecture whilst maintaining quality of service through advanced technical terms of usage and value creation of the solutions such as network slicing and is future internet what does it tell us about the proof for easy incorporation of yet unforeseen advantages and disadvantages in terms of services and functionalities through network the rate of innovation access security virtualisation and its service based architecture privacy etc of uncontrolled development sba g over the time will become an open versus regulation fabric of connectivity tailored capacity connectivity and security and privacy will be internet is based on simple ip internet offered by network operators to other industries protocols that enable a variety of systems to be as network as a service naas platform easily integrated this simplicity in networking is through standard and open interfaces at the expense of compromising quality reliability security and privacy it is also combination of above features will help in developing and implementing customised important to appreciate the fact that internet is services service quality security and privacy to not based on any global standard unlike mobile suit different industries needs standards but mainly rests on a set of recommendations by internet engineering task force ietf on which governance areas is it useful openness and user anonymity of internet are or even essential for government to focus main the reasons for it becoming widespread if we are to develop an effective and but at the expense of not being secure and with efficient nex t generation ecosystem no guaranteed quality of service but mainly on g can be seriously considered as the best effort in delivery the main innovation area cornerstone of future digital transformation of in internet is in services and applications rather society and economy four important factors than in technology need to be in place for the digital transformation on the other hand mobile systems are amongst to happen quickly and smoothly most secure and reliable form of communication liberalization of frequency spectrum networks by being based on agreed global open digital infrastructure standards quality of service in addition to mutual and multi lateral trust framework security and privacy are at the heart of mobile system design in standardisation process mobile unified data models https www ietf org digital industry governance and g frequency spectrum availability is key enabler temperature sensors to machines as large as for tether less connectivity mobility for vehicles drones trains etc will be commonly anywhere and anytime and overall system cost deployed as combination of wearables short more spectrum in useful part of radio spectrum range environment and ambient information needs to be farmed so as to enable cost effective sensing actuating networks to wide area coverage and capacity current licensing regimen networks future networks will be a network of need to be changed from nationwide blanket networks in providing complementary coverage license to location based and on principle of whilst enabling different and smart services acknowledged co existence between different such devices need to certify each other in order deployment of networks whether in form of to form a network this certification process and public private non public or a hybrid of them its related algorithm needs to be dynamic and this will enable proliferation of many networks efficient in terms of signalling load and energy in support of many businesses and hence consumption as the network size and member positive impacts on society and economy devices in a network could dynamically change another important consideration is that instead this requires an efficient and multi lateral trust of moving up in frequency spectrum radio framework to automatically and dynamically regulators need to move down and allocate or verify authorise and certify devices machines re farm sufficient radio spectrum to help that belong to a network or to an organisation network operators to provide cost efficient blockchain for example is possible technology coverage for this multi lateral trust algorithm however digital infrastructure must adopt open secure blockchain suffers from energy consumption and standardised interfaces so that any business and requirements for a huge amount of could outsource or develop its own services and signalling resertach therefore need to focus on applications open infrastructure with open and finding a new algorithm an efficient trust standard interfaces will help with diversification framework should be defined by standard in technology and the services content bodies that facilitates a business to develop its ecosystem the interfaces should be based on a own trust algorithm whilst does not violating common standard to ease interoperability at inter operability between different devices different layers of protocol stack this way important part of interoperability is mobile standards will enable service application development of common and rich semantics and innovation as internet has enjoyed by being an agreed data model standards by industry to open architecture the more important layers in simplify data management integration of a protocol stack are the application layer different services to create new services as well network layer media physical layer and as help with data analytics and people data hardware devices layer where common and anonymisation for privacy preserving to clarify standard interfaces should be on global this point a good example of uniform data standardisation agenda model is swim a system wide information future communications will be more and more management swim concept that consists of about connecting machines to the extent that at standards infrastructure and governance any time and in any location there will be more enabling the management of air traffic than devices per person

to economies of predictions scale with respect to standards governments need to work with each other to agree on set of what would an ideal digital governance processes for standard that are inclusive fair and system look like assuming global cooperation inducive for small and large enterprises for were possible example the establishment of common and rich semantics and data models will overcome a suitable organisation should be set up to drive current data silos between different countries common standard for semantics and data different businesses in one country as well as models this organisation should operate on even between different networks within one international level and should be inclusive of organisation common data models will make different organisations from different countries transformation of data into useful information perhaps in addition to united nation itu t itu r and their integration in creation of richer and itu d focusing on telecommunication

delay in widespread roll on rich and all digital services inclusive semantics out of smart city concepts another important and data format standards governance possibly factor contributing to delays in realising smart called itu da or itu di standing for itu data or cities is lack of common and global technology itu digital standards g with mmtc can be considered as the regional standardisation organisations an important technology pillar for smart cities should work with this itu di towards a common covering many use cases global standard which could also consider user covid provides a recent example of the data privacy through appropriate anonymisation problems associated with data silos where framework trust frameworks and security governments could not share raw data between

for the planet alexandra bolton executive director centre for digital built britain mark coates international director of public policy and advocacy bentley systems peter el hajj national digital twin programme lead centre for digital built britainforeword alexandra bolton the finance industry has long been at the forefront of using data and technology to make better decisions to de risk to improve return on investments and to create better outcomes tackling the big challenges of our day climate change and resilience energy healthcare relies on having the right technologies and data to make the right interventions at centre for digital built britain cdbb we have seen how digital twins can improve decision making in the planning design build and operation of assets we have also seen the benefits of connecting digital twins across organisations and sectors the finance community has a huge opportunity to realise the benefits of digital twins by using them to add value track sustainability targets attract new investments and manage risk better however collaboration across the industry is key when we collaborate across boundaries across borders we can do amazing things we can make better business decisions that drive better economic social and environmental outcomes on behalf of cdbb i would like to thank everyone involved in this paper mark coates and bentley systems for their leadership which was key to making this paper a reality and all who so generously shared their expertise experience and knowledge i am excited to see how the finance community will join with the wider infrastructure community and solution providers to use higher quality data and digital twins to improve investment returns meet esg goals and create the sustainable future we all want to see how finance and digital twins can shape a better future for the planetdigital twins centre for digital built britain cdbb describes a digital twin as a digital representation of an asset system or process what distinguishes a digital twin from any other digital model is its connection to the physical twin based on data from the physical asset or system a digital twin unlocks value by supporting improved decision making which creates the opportunity for positive feedback into the physical twin a digital twin can be dynamic capturing current performance data from the physical twin or static a model of a system with input of long term condition data from the physical twin via corporate reporting systems and the capital investment process how finance and digital twins can shape a better future for the planetbetter outcomes for all how the finance community can shape the future of digital twins at the heart of the transforming infrastructure performance programme lies the need for a step change in productivity it will require data from all parts of the syste m to inform decision making from improved information management in delivery to the creation of digital twins for asset maintenance and optimisation nick smallwood ceo infrastructure and projects authority in recent years there has been an explosion of interest in the potential role of digital twins in the transformation of how infrastructure and the built environment are planned designed constructed and operated modern digital approaches are at the heart of an emerging government industry change programme captured in the work of the centre for digital built britain cdbb and in key documents such as the construction playbook transforming infrastructure performance road map to and the gemini papers during the five years of the cdbb programme we have seen a step change in the quality of the dialogue between industry academia and the public sector it has created a greater shared understanding of the use cases and benefits of digital twins at all stages of the asset lifecycle as well as having unlocked increased investment in digital solutions that have generated ever more economic social and environmental benefits the catalyst for this paper was to ask if the same has been true for the dialogue between an increasingly tight knit industry driving the digital transformation of infrastructure and the investors insurers banks and other institutions who provide much of their funding and finance to answer this question we have spoken with a wide range of investors to get a better understanding of how and why they are currently using infrastructure related data as well as their level of knowledge and interest in the potential of digital twins our conclusion is that there is huge untapped potential for investors to influence how data is used to improve infrastructure decision making and that taking on a greater role in the digital transformation of infrastructure will provide better outcomes for businesses people and nature there is also a significant opportunity to leverage digital twins to support key challenges facing the finance community where to allocate capital screening and managing risk enhancing asset value by improving performance and reliability and complying with environmental social and governance esg requirements the key to unlocking this potential is to apply the fundamentals of the information value chain the finance community can collaborate with the wider industry to develop practical use cases that help them use the insights derived from data to solve their most pressing problems make better decisions and create more value the infrastructure sector needs to play its part and approach this dialogue with openness and flexibility infrastructure professionals need to understand that investors generate their return on investment roi in a variety of ways via different types of assets and at different stages of the infrastructure lifecycle some of their use cases overlap with those al ready developed for supply chain businesses or operators while others will not in the remainder of this paper we set out three steps for improving the quality of the dialogue between investors and other parts of the infrastructure sector re imagine the information value chain from an investor s perspective explore how investors can expand their leadership role and share some use cases investors are currently pursuing finally in the spirit of encouraging dialogue and collaboration the paper ends with a series of open questions that we hope will kick start a debate that will bring investors into the heart of the effort to digitally transform infrastructure performance how finance and digital twins can shape a better future for the planetimproving collaboration between the finance community and the wider infrastructure sector step understanding the variety of infrastructure investors and what that means for the different ways that they can benefit from digital twins the first step to bringing investors into the heart of the debate on digital twin adoption is simply to recognise that they are not a homogeneous undifferentiated group infrastructure investor is a broad term that embraces a range of institutions that invest in the debt or equity of infrastructure assets or businesses investors may fund the construction of new greenfield assets or acquire operational brownfield assets there are numerous types of infrastructure investors pursuing a variety of strategies to achieve roi private equity firms and asset managers typically invest pools of funds on behalf of institutional investors such as pension funds insurers or sovereign wealth funds funds will hold these stakes for different lengths of time depending on their investment strategy but it will normally be at least three to five years fund managers use their expertise to support asset managers to maximise performance revenues and re sale value they will normally receive an annual management fee based on the value of the fund and be entitled i m not looking to a share of gross profits for a grand commercial banks provide both debt and equity depending on their investment strategy debt may be in vision i need the form of the purchase of bonds issued by infrastructure asset owners or loans secured against the asset something issuers of debt will normally be more hands off than an equity investor and have a shorter term interest in the underlying asset scalable institutional investors pension and or sovereign wealth funds may also employ their own interoperable internal teams to invest directly in the equity of infrastructure assets and businesses major players intelligible in the market include big canadian pension funds and the sovereign wealth funds of states such as abu dhabi and singapore and above development banks are national regional or financial institutions that provide debt equity and guarantees all useful for higher risk infrast ructure investments normally in developing countries that cannot be supported in their entirety by private markets development banks are typically set up by governments or non profit organisations and normally operate to policy mandates setting out the social economic and environmental objectives to be supported by the bank s activities examples include the european bank for reconstruction and development the new u k infrastructure bank has many of the characteristics of a development bank and is providing gbp billion of finance to support climate change and levelling up objectives others key stakeholders include insurers advisors and guarantee providers how finance and digital twins can shape a better future for the planetstep understanding how investors categorise infrastructure a second step is to understand how digital twins are likely to relate to how the finance community typically categorises infrastructure many investors divide the sector into four categories of opportunities see figure below category description examples source of revenue rates charged to users agreed energy rail road water upon with regulators and waste utilities assets essential core long term contracts with for society schools hospitals and government counterparties other social infrastructure based on availability or similar payment mechanism contracted power similar to the core generation long term contracts category but with potential core plus for greater variability of toll roads airport concession arrangement cash flows and seaports greenfield projects that new build utility will become core assets school or hospital long and short term post construction projects contracts value added assets with opportunities data centres revenues from for growth expansion air or seaport expanded services or repositioning expansion assets in emerging markets contracts with less assets in financial distress merchant power reliable counterparties opportunistic generation or assets exposed to waste processing volatile revenues high level of cost or revenue uncertainty how finance and digital twins can shape a better future for the planetstep relating digital twin use cases to different investor strategies a third step is to link potential use cases for digital twins to how investors build investment strategies at the most basic level infrastructure is seen as an attractive investment because it offers stable reliable returns often backed by a government counterparty in times of economic uncertainty investments in real physical assets that provide essential government supported services are unsurprisingly particularly attractive behind that general rule however lies a variety of approaches to generating an acceptable roi figure below source preqin shows how the four categories of infrastructure can form the basis of strategies based on expected roi risk appetite and the balance between generating returns from maximising revenues or profits from the re sale of assets regulated assets and social infrastructure reimagining the information value chain for investors the use cases for a digital twin will vary for different types of infrastructure investors pursing different strategies the fundamentals of building a use case for deriving value from data are however no different for investors than for any other organisation collecting data has no inherent value it must be used to make better decisions that lead to improved outcomes sense making is needed to convert data into insights that can support this process this simple idea can be captured in the information value chain the figure above sets out how the information value chain could look for infrastructure investors how finance and digital twins can shape a better future for the planet nruter htworg latipac risk swoflhsac partially regulated assets unregulated assets with with demand risk competition demand risk opportunities value added core plus coreexamples of decisions improve esg report carbon impact footprint inform future maximise performance decision taking investments payments examples of sense making esg frameworks financial models sense making predictive models data management examples of sources of data esg the biggest data challenge for the finance community the u k government has set out detailed plans for greening finance to support its ambitious net zero carbon target the plan includes the sustainability disclosure requirements announced by the chancellor in july in october the chancellor also confirmed that the u k will adopt in full the recommendations of the task force on climate related financial disclosures tcfd the goal is to ensure that the financial flows across the economy shift to align with the net zero commitment and wider sustainability goals how information and capital flows through the economy capital environment companies financial financial investors sector products information source hm government greening finance and roadmap to sustainable investing the sustainable disclosure requirements will create a single integrated framework for decision useful disclosures on esg related issues it will cover three categories of disclosures corporate disclosures requirements for companies including financial services businesses to make sustainability disclosures this reporting will adhere to agreed international standards asset manager and asset owner disclosures new requirements for asset managers and asset owners including occupational pension schemes to disclose how they take sustainability into account in their decision making investment product disclosure new requirements for creators of investment products to report on the products sustainability impact and relevant financial risks and opportunities this information will also form the basis of a new sustainable investment labelling regime how finance and digital twins can shape a better future for the planet in addition despite brexit the eu sustainable finance disclosure regulation will affect anyone raising money from investors inside the eu and there are signs that the u s is moving in a similar direction in a recent article on infrastructure s esg revolution gordon bajnai head of global infrastructure at private equity business campbell lutyens summed up the current situation sectors such as energy and transportation have a measurable impact on our efforts to decarbonise the world while sectors such as digital have a huge role to play in bridging divides in society esg measument reporting and benchmarking have become standard in infrastructure if you want to raise money these things are must haves and not nice to have this situation is creating a big demand for processes and technology to monitor measure and report on esg risks across an investor s portfolio it also means that esg assessments are playing a greater role in due diligence processes for lending as well as for the buying and selling of assets by equity investors unfortunately as a recent survey published by preqin demonstrates the finance community is being held back by a lack of consistent high quality data fund manager views on the main challenges of implementing an esg policy lack of quality consistent esg data confusion over industry terminology shortage of knowledge or expertise political or regulatory uncertainty difficulty in delivering both financial and non financial returns excessive costs lack of consensus from internal stakeholders not relvant to our strategy or mandate lack of quality investment opportunities fiduciary concerns proportion of respondents source preqin fund manager survey november the need for a step change in the quality and usefulness of esg related data looks like one of the greatest information challenges facing the finance community and perhaps the single biggest use case for a digital twin that can create a bridge between financial data physical assets and the natural environment how can investors take a more active leadership role it is necessary for the infrastructure sector to improve how it engages with infrastructure investors in fact it is vital if we want those investors to play a bigger role in driving the roll out of digital twins of built environment assets investors themselves need to take the initiative and use their leverage to encourage creating digital twins in ways that align to their interests talking with investors it was once again clear that different types of investors have different opportunities to take this leadership role one way to think about this is through the lens of investors different relationships with the organisations planning constructing and maintaining infrastructure assets how finance and digital twins can shape a better future for the planetdebt incentivising the creation of be tter quality data banks providing debt to infrastructure businesses or project based special purpose vehicles have a very transactional relationship they lend money to support the creation expansion and maintenance of assets and then receive repayment at an agreed rate of interest in an agreed upon time frame these loans are normally secured against assets and lenders have first call on their revenues or resale value if things do not go according to plan however they will not receive any share of the upside if the assets outperform therefore lenders opportunities to influence digitalisation are generally shorter term and linked to their need to de risk lending and meet their reporting and regulatory requirements as efficiently as possible one public private partnership ppp equity investor talked us through how they used a spatial temporal digital twin developed for a mega project to demonstrate to their banks that risks were being managed effectively during the construction and commissioning phase this technology allowed the investor to secure market leading rates from the consortia of banks providing the debt finance for the project we are also aware of cases like that of great portland estates gpe who in signed a gbp million esg linked revolving credit facility rcf as part of its plan to become net zero by this innovative facility the first to be issued by a u k real estate investment trust incorporates three esg linked key performance indicators kpis aligned to gpe s sustainability strategy these kpis include annual pre agreed targets and are based on supporting gpes target to decarbonise its existing buildings and reducing the energy intensity of its portfolio by by supporting gpes target to build net zero carbon new buildings from providing better quality urban greening measures by increasing biodiversity across gpes portfolio gpe s lenders have agreed that a decrease or increase of up to basis points will be applied to their headline margin based on performance against the kpis in both cases the bank s goals were not to drive the digital transformation of buildings and infrastructure these targets incentivise gpe to accelerate the decarbonisation of their business and will support continued behavioural change across their supply chain however it is easy to see how the existence and use of high quality up to date data linked to the physical assets increased their confidence that construction was being de risked and that esg kpis were being met these examples demonstrate that there is a case for big lenders to get on the front foot and be more vocal about the digital information that they want to see alongside the physical assets that they are financing and translate it into competitive interest rates and other returns as one interviewee told us when people price big infrastructure jobs they price what they don t know as the information improves they ll have to go lean because the risks are known equity maximising the value of assets equity investors on the other hand usually take a higher risk but share in increased revenues during the lifetime of their investment and can sell on their stakes at a profit therefore their business model typically already involves working closely with owners and operators on improvement plans this situation opens up many more opportunities to drive progress including through digital transformation initiatives it is particularly true for investors with larger portfolios often spread across many counties one such investor explained to us how they sought to ensure at least a base level of digitisation across the businesses in which they had equity stakes telling us if you have two wind farms and one has some form of digital twin and one just a pdf with some annual performance reporting it s obvious that for the owner and their engineers the former is less risky and it is clearer where we can add value then when it comes to re sale assets that have a transparent life history are more transactionable how finance and digital twins can shape a better future for the planetthis investor explained that they helped local managers to exploit the benefits of being part of the fund s portfolio for example helping a smaller local utility in one country work with larger businesses in the same sector to access digital expertise and share knowledge the construction and infrastructure sectors have for decades talked about the importance of intelligent clients many of the equity investors that we spoke with talked about the importance of being an intelligent shareholder a big part of which is having plans to increase the digital maturity of their assets government catalysing data sharing for the public good one final category of investor that has a leadership role to play is government the public sector provides much of the finance that goes into the u k s infrastructure many of the wider benefits from better infrastructure data derive not solely from digital twins of individual assets but also from the ability to share data safely and securely across organisational and sectoral boundaries to realise the systematic benefits of better data and connected digital twins governments must play a catalysing convening connecting and co ordinating role as demonstrated by such initiatives as the cdbb s own national digital twin programme and the national infrastructure commission s data for the public good study our interviews highlighted several intriguing opportunities for government seeing benefits the government of queensland in australia is sponsoring the cross river rail project to build a new kilometer rail line in brisbane influenced by its conversations with the u k crossrail project cross river is much more rail the public company delivering the railway has invested heavily in a detailed digital twin of the project important th an the potential uses of the model go beyond the delivery and operation and maintenance of the rail embracing infrastructure for example the original goal of the cross river rail project was to monitor the roadway however there are ripple effects of this digital twin project the rail organization can now measure traffic in leading edge certain areas and make investments in the right infrastructure our view is that the model has the potential technology to form the basis of a city wide digital twin a connected ecosystem that can deliver benefits by supporting investment decision making on a city wide basis this type of digital twin would deliver value greater than the sum of its parts especially in the run up to brisbane s hosting of the olympics other publicly funded mega projects have leeway in their budgets to make these kind of anchor investments they can also use their influence to establish de facto norms for data management and interoperability elsewhere investors are looking to exploit public data sets that might not normally be associated with an infrastructure digital twin we spoke to one investor who is exploring how they could align their in house corporate data with public data sets relating to measures such as educational attainment crime and local economic development this application would open opportunities for investors to demonstrate how their activity was contributing to policy goals with the potential for more effective allocation of resources and the creation of new income streams for investors the quality accuracy and accessibility of these data sets remain a barrier to realising this vision despite the efforts of the office of national statistics cabinet office and others however our investor was convinced that if government worked to make better quality data openly available private sector players would lean in and develop new solutions to help meet national goals like net zero what kind of use cases are investors interested in in our conversations with different types of investors we heard about a variety of current and potential use cases here are just a few examples how can i use data and digital maturity to help increase the value of assets while equity investors have different strategies for how long they want to hold on to assets they will look to sell on at a profit at some point several interviewees told us that they are developing strategies to ensure that assets are more digitally mature at re sale they are confident that it provides an objective demonstration of high performance and reduced risk that will increase re sale value enhanced performance will also increase revenues during the period of ownership and can help crowd in further value enhancing investment how finance and digital twins can shape a better future for the planethow can i use data and digital maturity to screen esg impacts and comply with regulations multinational development banks explained to us that they have a fundamental need to demonstrate the impact of their investments against a variety of economic social and environmental metrics they told us that they are exploring actively how digital technologies can improve the efficiency and transparency of how impact is measured we also heard from investors in social and economic infrastructure about an opportunity to go beyond esg reporting and open up potential new revenue streams by demonstrating a direct correlation between their investments and government policy goals such as crime reduction or educational attainment these investors are looking to work with digital specialists to blend publicly available data such as crime figures with their own in house data more broadly investors also face a host of esg and safety related reporting requirements these demands are creating one of the most powerful use cases amongst investors for better data safety the grenfell tower tragedy has ushered in a renewed focus from government and regulators on the safety of higher risk buildings the buildings safety act is expected to receive royal assent in the first half of with significant changes to duties around risk management being phased in over the subsequent month period the act builds on the findings of dame judith hackitt s review of building regulations and fire safety dame judith recommended the introduction of a robust golden thread of key information to allow all parties to use information to safely and effectively design construct and operate their buildings she stated that this data must be passed to future building owners to underpin more effective safety management the recommendations and the subsequent legislation are intended to address the problems within the industry of vital information not being effectively managed or sometimes not even available in a usable form to ensure that the right people have the information that they need to ensure the safety of buildings the act also requires that the data be used to create a safety case owned by an accountable person in practice it means accountable persons normally the landlord or freeholder will need to demonstrate that risks have been identified and assessed and that a credible plan is in place to reduce or control them to an appropriate level these plans must be maintained and regular reports must be submitted to regulators how can i optimise energy performance real estate equity investors told us that improving energy performance was the single most appealing use case for digital twins in their world success would tick esg and carbon reduction boxes while promising to enhance roi via performance improvements and enhanced user experience these investors are actively exploring how scenario modelling and analysis can help identify the interventions with the greatest energy performance benefits how can i mitigate risks created by bad data the grenfell tragedy is educating the whole built environm ent sector on the human reputational legal and financial risks created by poor or incomplete data the building safety act will be phased in over the next months introducing the requirement to maintain a golden thread of asset information through the lifetime of the highest risk buildings it shows how better data practices up to and including the creation of digital twins can mitigate the risks created by poor data which is an increasingly compelling use case for many investors how finance and digital twins can shape a better future for the planethow can i maximise my income from availability payments many investors have revenue streams tied to payment mechanisms based on performance standards such as lane availability on their roads or classrooms heated in their schools these investors are pursuing use cases for digital twins that help investors maximise revenue by ensuring operational teams are alerted when action is needed to head off any drop in service levels this data can also provide a historic record of performance useful for proving compliance with contractual obligations over the course of the contract how can i reduce my cost of capital one ppp investor talked us through how they used a spatial temporal digital twin developed for a mega project to demonstrate to banks that the construction and commissioning risks were being managed effectively by the project delivery team this situation allowed them to secure market leading rates from the consortia of banks providing the debt finance for the project moving the conversation forward the goal of this white paper has been to kick start a dialogue that can bring infrastructure investors closer to the centre of efforts driving digital transformation of the infrastructure sector instead of finishing with a traditional conclusion we decided to convert some of the themes explored throughout the paper into a series of questions that initiate that conversation these questions are by no means an exhaustive list and we are very happy to be told other questions are more important the key however is to start the conversation infrastructure is what changes do digital twin solution providers need to make and how they paradoxically very operate to better serve infrastructure investor interests simple from an investor s point in our conversations with infrastructure investors we picked up a hint of frustration that some digital twin solution providers focus on pitching the capabilities of technology rather than focusing on investors of view but also problems and how digital twins can provide solutions we were also reminded that investors are not very murky there engineers or digital specialists and need these solutions explained to them in their language is no bloomberg can digital twin solution providers change their mindset and play a more proactive role in communicating for infrastructure the benefits of digital twins to investors working with them to co create solut ions that meet their contractual business needs as a first step can they pull together some existing use cases that can really communicate and celebrate success relationships mean information can be can we reach a consensus on the most promising use cases and really ambiguous set some shared challenges as we have seen there are many use cases already being explored by infrastructure investors can a dialogue between the investor community and the infrastructure sector reach consensus on what are the most pressing and promising can we set some shared challenges what level of digital information will really be needed to serve them is visualization the requirement or can needs be met at least in the first instance by something simpler should a digital maturity assessment be a standard part of investors due diligence process we heard from several investors who have developed simple metrics to assess the digital maturity of the people and organisations in which they are investing they help with risk assessment and identifying opportunities for adding value to the assets and barriers to their realisation should these steps become a much more standard part of the due diligence process is there a role for non commercial players like cdbb and its successors to help codify and standardise digital maturity the sophistication of an infrastructure owner s cyber security measures will be a key metric in any digital maturity assessment one development bank told us that many of the projects that they invest in form part of developing countries critical national infrastructure supporting the digitalisation of these nations energy grid or similar projects not only delivers real economic social and environmental benefits but also increases vulnerability to cyber attacks in response the bank has taken a very top down approach to using its leverage to improve data security and standards as well as ensuring that the maturity exists to maintain them over time how finance and digital twins can shape a better future for the planetin the commercial market we heard that fears about the additional complexity and risk created by cyber security can be a barrier to investors embracing digital innovation how can solution providers and the finance community collaborate more effectively to deal with the challenges of cyber security are there lessons that can be transferred from development banking into the commercial sector what will make providers of debt offer competitive interest rates for assets with digital twins we heard from one investor who had secured highly competitive terms from banks that are providing debt for a greenfield mega project the use of digital twins to de risk the construction phase played a key role we know that some banks have been willing to offer competitive rates to projects demonstrating performance against esg targets something that generates a strong use case for comprehensive asset and performance data can we encourage banks to be more proactive in offering competitive lending terms to projects utilising digital twin technology to address these risks and opportunities are there other motivations that the sector could tap into what more can governments do to help cross river rail in brisbane is an example of where a publicly sponsored mega project can provide the catalyst for a city level digital twin that can support better investment decisions as it s the we also heard that some of the most useful data sets for building a use case are those held by governments or agencies it can include data needed to assess the impact of investments such as changes to crime rates operational educational attainment and economic development unfortunately many of these data sets are patchy results that or out of date can government be encouraged to tackle this problem and then to challenge the industry to lean into this data to drive progress towards big policy goals like levelling up and net zero will give us the momentum to engage the takeaways the goal of this white paper has been to kick start a dialogue that can bring infrastructure investors closer to the centre of efforts driving digital transformation of the infrastructure sector the value of information management in the construction and infrastructure sector report estimated that every gbp invested in information management could potentially secure up to gbp of labour time savings all while boosting government efforts to reach net zero carbon emissions by five takeaways are proposed to advance digital twins and unlock their benefits for the finance community adopt the gemini principles in your digital strategies cdbb is calling on leaders involved in managing and investing in the built environment to build the gemini principles into their digital strategies the principles enable a values based approach for the development of digital twins and alignment for organisations digital twins to support esg reporting there is a great data challenge facing the finance community in terms of access accuracy and consistency of data this challenge is on the critical path for esg reporting digital twins should be built on high quality data and there is large overlap between data required for esg reporting and data needed for managing of assets advancing the use of digital twins will drive better data quality and improve chances for timely esg reporting open data to unlock its value data has value in isolation and an increased value is realised when it is shared and connected open data does not mean that everyone has access to the data but rather means that data is shareable within the ecosystem of partners clients and the supply chain according to the gemini principles data must be as open as possible while remaining consistent with the principles of holistic security to create maximum value for everyone including data from many sources is essential to maximising value of digital twins assess and upskill digital capabilities the changes brought by digitisation are driving a need for new services across the industry such as cyber resilience data engineering data science and software development organisations in the finance community should assess digital capabilities and upskill as required to ensure a resilient and productive value chain that is fit for the future how finance and digital twins can shape a better future for the planet collaborate the finance community is core to the infrastructure industry and is positioned to reap benefits of better communication and information sharing across the industry established communities like the digital twin hub are a great place to shape the future of digital twins in the industry by sharing success stories and lessons learned as well as connect to others involved with digital twins cdbb has worked closely with the industry academia and the government to explore and create solutions for the challenges facing the built environment the gemini papers present their learnings from the past five years capturing the consensus viewpoint of the connected digital twin community and serving as a blueprint for future leaders the finance community is in a strong position to lead the industry forward next steps join the conversation this white paper is one of the final pieces from the centre for digital built britain which completes its mission at the end of march however many of its activities will continue including the digital twin hub which has created a community of infrastructure professionals who are committed to change as members of that community we are committed to working with colleagues to bring investors into the mainstream of the movement and to drive the digital transformation of the infrastructure sector creating better outcomes for people and the planet if you would like to be part of that effort or have views on any of the questions or issues raised in this paper we would love to hear from you you can get in touch via the digital twin hub or reach out to us individually on linkedin we look forward to hearing from you

based relationships with clients training and skills development initiatives for employees robust structures for effective collaboration and communication conclusion introduction background the uk construction industry has been frequently berated for its problems of low productivity delays unsafe work practices and the delivery of projects that exceed planned costs to tackle these problems the government has ramped up efforts to drive an increase in the use of digital technologies and manufacturing approaches for delivering construction projects and managing built assets building information modelling bim and offsite manufacturing osm have been put forward as the two key innovations that can be used to deliver projects faster cheaper safer and at higher quality the current industrial strategy is the construction sector deal outlines the government s partnership with industry to promote the use of bim and osm to reduce construction and whole lifecycle asset costs by over a third reduce delays in construction project delivery and greenhouse gas emissions by half in the construction playbook recently published by the cabinet office sets out how the government is prioritising the deployment of these innovations through public sector procurement in order to make their use mainstream in the construction industry for any of these goals to be achieved the construction industry needs to embrace the use of bim and osm on a large scale however this will only happen if construction firms i e consultants general contractors specialist subcontractors are able to adopt and use bim and osm successfully despite this critical need for engagement both take up and use remain low there are several reasons for this and the lack of evidence of the real benefits of the use of bim and osm has made construction firms reluctant to embrace their adoption wolstenholme a never waste a good crisis a review of progress since rethinking construction london

building for change oral and written evidence presented to the uk house of lords london despite this some construction firms are successfully using bim and osm the experiences of these firms can provide useful learning for other construction firms about this guidance this guidance document describes six key factors that will help construction firms to transform their project delivery through the adoption and use of bim and osm our research has shown that construction firms that have successfully adopted and are using bim and osm share six common characteristics committed leadership and management a digital transformation strategy with realistic objectives competent supplier networks built through a growing together approach trust based relationships with their clients well developed training and skills development initiatives for employees and robust structures for effective collaboration and communication the insights shared in this guidance draw on interviews with over construction industry stakeholders in the uk contractors consultants and clients who have undertaken commercial residential and infrastructure projects across the country and overseas nine recommendations are put forward in this guidance document designed to guide construction firms taking steps to adopt and use bim and osm the recommendations are specifically targeted at senior executives and managers of construction firms regardless of size who can implement initiatives to enable their firms to adopt and use bim and osm or improve what is already in place what does it take to successfully adopt and use digital technologies and offsite manufacturing figure illustrates how the leadership and management of a firm is crucial for creating a framework within which all the other factors can be implemented it also shows how implementation of these factors has both internal and external implications for firms figure enabling factors in the sections that follow each factor is described and supported by relevant industry examples and key recommendations for implementation by other construction firms committed leadership and management a firm needs committed leadership to support the process of change having a leader who will champion the digital transformation vision within a firm is essential for success a transformation agenda cannot focus solely on technology but must consider individual practices and internal culture in order to successfully establish new ways of working among employees for a transformation strategy to trickle down through a firm leaders need to believe in the strategies they are implementing a leader champion can be an executive or manager who believes in the urgency of digital transformation its long term benefits and who is committed to implementing the necessary strategies to achieve the vision this will involve communicating the digital strategy and vision in ways that appeal to employees and their work related aspirations engagement needs to be personalised and people focused and spearheaded by a manager or committee who understands this and is able to communicate clearly and coherently across all areas of the firm and its supply chain a supportive leadership culture values employee suggestions ensuring that input from employees is treated in a way that shows that they are valued is important because this has a direct impact on employees willingness to be a part of the transformation a factor that can either constrain or facilitate digital transformation when employees see that their suggestions have been implemented in a company s practices it can boost their participation in the digitalisation agenda to ensure that employees are genuinely involved in the transformation journey it is crucial for management to communicate regularly and clearly with employees and be open to receiving feedback this is important for successful digital transformation leadership training resources are available

of digital technologies recognition by external industry awards also serves as a big boost for the team since they know they are working in one of the best firms in the industry when it comes to using these digital innovations recommendations appoint a digital transformation leader champion it is crucial for construction firms to appoint a person or team who will champion the transformation vision and who is committed to the urgency of digital transformation and who will drive and oversee the implementation of a digital transformation plan the leader champion needs to hold an executive or

achieve goals for the use of digital technologies a digital transformation strategy with realistic objectives a digital transformation strategy is a plan that shows where a firm is at outlines a vison of change and provides guidance for how that change will be achieved in the future a clear digital transformation strategy should be developed and implemented by construction firms seeking to make greater use of digital technologies and osm a successful digital transformation strategy provides a step by step map of how to create a new firm culture around the use of new technologies tools are available to help firms assess their current digital capabilities and competencies and to benchmark them against potential competitors so that future actions can be improved construction firms seeking to undergo a digital transformation will benefit from undertaking such an assessment prior to developing their digital transformation strategy a digital strategy should be geared towards establishing

the uk top construction companies the firm has over employees involved in its residential and non residential construction interior fit out and refurbishment projects at willmott dixon there is a national digital strategy for all its businesses core to this strategy is the use of bim as business as usual for all projects regardless of clients requests divisional and regional managers are responsible for adhering to this and are tasked with effectively and consistently communicating the strategy to their teams digital managers from its six regional local construction offices lcos contribute to this strategy by proposing additional local strategies that align to the national digital this approach enables direct employee input to feed into the development of the national willmott dixon digital strategy given the large size of the firm and allows lcos to incorporate any unique digital needs of clients and projects into the overarching national digital strategy through the local strategy the national and local strategies are therefore aligned to achieve the same transformation objectives the incorporation of local digital strategies by the lcos has created an avenue for employees to propose new digital technologies for consideration prior to adoption new technologies are examined to ascertain their fit with the company s strategic goals and processes this step provides an opportunity to establish the individual and collective benefits for internal operations and on projects this creates an awareness among employees of the positive benefits yielded by the

need to develop a digital strategy that sets out realistic transformation objectives in plain language it should be simple easy to understand and consistent it should be consistently communicated across all levels and areas of a firm and repeated until a new firm culture has been established it is very important that senior executives and management support and drive the development of the strategy alongside their employees jointly creating a digital transformation strategy is critical for ensuring that employees have shared ownership of the vision and objectives that the strategy articulates building a capable supplier network through a growing together approach construction firms need to ensure their supply chain has the necessary skills and capabilities to deliver projects using bim and osm to achieve this they may need to support their supply chain to develop these capabilities firms operating as suppliers in the construction supply chain are critical for successful project execution as contractors are heavily reliant on their supplier networks including general specialist trade subcontractors whilst some contractors have developed capabilities to use bim and osm not all of the firms they work with in their supplier networks will have such capabilities the successful use of bim and osm on projects requires that suppliers also have the necessary level of skills and capabilities this may involve firms helping to equip subcontractors so that they can use the same or similar hardware and software or tools when working on projects using bim and osm there are resources available for construction firms to assess their supplier network needs as part of their digital transformation programmes some of the large contractors interviewed are adopting a growing together approach to build and upskill a supplier network with the necessary capabilities for working on projects that involve the use of bim and osm this supportive approach involves hosting workshops training sessions and company visits to learn of capability challenges and to offer training support to suppliers by adopting this approach firms have learned about the challenges faced by their suppliers in terms of the digital skills of their staff hardware software and training needs and as a result they have offered bespoke assistance to address these needs this approach has also enabled contractors to share the digital and manufacturing capabilities needed for future projects this transparency ensures that supplier firms aware of what they will need to keep working on projects with the contractors and is considered to be a win win approach to building a competent supplier network the growing together approach has proven to be particularly useful for construction

digital capability relies heavily on supply chain transformation skanska recognises the need to support its supply chain as part of successfully implementing its digital transformation strategy the firm is eager to maintain their longstanding working relationships with these suppliers because they have built a lot of trust with them part of their approach involves providing their suppliers with access to training offered by the supply chain sustainability school of which skanska is a founding member in partnership with the citb the fact that the resources provided are free to use removes one of the major barriers to upskilling the supply chain another of skanska s strategies involves increasingly challenging their supplier network partners to explore the use of new technologies on projects skanska encourages their suppliers to develop the capabilities needed to work with them using these technologies using a strategy called innovation push a growing together strategy involves providing the requisite training workshops and regular communication necessary to inform firms in their supplier network about digital technologies that can be adopted for doing things more quickly and with less labour as well as how to use more off site approaches this provides skanska with opportunities to keep their supply chain partners informed about the digital capabilities required for specific projects continuous engagement with their supplier network partners means that skanska is able to learn about capability gaps and support them in a learning process towards improvement this focus on developing their supplier networks has been a key component for the successful implementation of projects using bim and osm https group skanska com about us skanska in brief https www theconstructionindex co uk news view top construction companies https www supplychainschool co uk recommendation support your supply chain to develop their digital and osm capabilities large contractors should aim to assist firms in their existing supplier networks to improve or build capabilities in using bim and osm for projects doing so will save time and resources in establishing new working relationships and in building trust with other firms they may not know well it is therefore helpful to support trustworthy and high performing suppliers to develop relevant capabilities for using digital technologies and osm this growing together approach can be achieved through the hosting of workshops and training sessions with subcontractors in order to understand their needs and jointly develop plans to help their development there are mutual benefits to be gained in doing this a strong supplier network equipped with digital and manufacturing capabilities is crucial in demonstrating relevant capacity at the tendering stage of projects and critical for successful project delivery building trust based relationships with clients clients are key players who can drive innovation in the industry and obtaining their buy in is crucial in order to increase the use of digital technologies and offsite manufacturing this is particularly important for private sector clients who are under no obligation to use any specific technology or approach for their projects unlike public sector clients who are obliged to require the use of bim and to give a presumption in favour of using osm where it could lead to value for money clients are typically concerned about getting the job done at the lowest price in order to maximise returns on investments and using digital technologies and osm is often seen as generating additional costs which clients are usually not willing to bear convincing clients about the use of bim and osm therefore begins with winning trust building a trust relationship usually takes time and involves honest communication offering reliable information about the inherent risks and the benefits associated with these innovations it also involves meeting agreed expectations regarding the use of bim and osm having mutual respect for values and maintaining a good reputation by following contractual requirements industry example multiplex at multiplex a combination of approaches is used in order to educate clients and to present them with the business case for the use of digital technologies fundamental to all the strategies used is building trust at multiplex building trust with clients is achieved by being transparent at the outset about the suitability of specific digital technologies for projects and their possible benefits and by offering critical professional advice on suitability for every project they actively engage with clients to assess which aspects would benefit most from the use of specific digital technologies and involve them in selecting suitable technologies for the job from an early stage in the project this approach enables otherwise reluctant clients to see the usefulness of the technologies for their projects multiplex relies on visual communication tools including d modelling and virtual reality in order to demonstrate the benefits of digital technologies regularly updating

sector viewpoint construction management and economics project progress using these same tools as well as drone footage of ongoing work helps to boost client trust and increase confidence in the use of innovative technologies for future projects recommendation build transparent long term trust based relationships with clients construction firms should make deliberate efforts to demonstrate the value of using digital technologies and osm for project delivery to clients this requires building relationships based on mutual trust over time through professional advice and clear and consistent articulation of the potential financial and sustainability gains to be made from using digital technologies and osm being able to demonstrate that the promised benefits and savings were delivered is crucial to maintaining that trust training and skills development initiatives for employees employees need to be supported to develop the necessary skills and competencies to enable them to engage with digital technologies and osm rather than assuming a particular level of digital competency firms need to establish a baseline of individual competencies so that employees can start their skills journey at the right level for them the digital competency scale provided by the citb is a good resource for undertaking this task as it helps to identify which groups of employees need which specific skills and competencies the supply chain sustainability school also has a wide range of programs available for training employees at different levels of competencies to complement these bespoke or one to one training which is tailored to individual digital literacy is crucial in addition it is useful to provide all employees with the basic skills for operating any underlying platform prior to introducing application software as part of a digital transformation programme companies should bear in mind that soft skills training including collaborative skills system thinking and communication are as fundamental as hard skills industry example kier kier is a leading uk construction and infrastructure services company with almost employees ranking second among the uk top construction

impacts of digital transformation on journeys to work in the cambridge sub region publishable report date required july abstract the project explores the possible impacts of digital transformation on journeys to work through the development of a city level digital twin cdt prototype that integrates data models and insights from multiple disciplines and sectors the research includes three work packages empirical investigation of key factors affecting worker s choice on place of work e g fixed workplace work at from home and on travel mode in the cambridge sub region developing a digital twin prototype including a web based interface for simulating journeys to work and testing two digital transformation scenarios prevalence of teleworking large scale adoption of electric vehicles engaging with local authorities modelling experts and other key stakeholders to collect feedback on the application and future development of cdt a productive partnership has been established between the local authorities and the project team for the co development of the digital twin prototype the project also collaborates closely with academics at ucl and cambridge key research outputs are discussed in detail and a series of working propositions are proposed which may guide the future research on cdt a city level digital twin experiment for exploring the impacts of digital transformation on journeys to work in the cambridge sub region introduction we are living through the th industrial revolution moving from a period of relative data scarcity to an era of digital abundance the sheer size of investments and efforts for building smart cities across the globe has epitomized the inspiration for future better cities in the digital era in the uk the national infrastructure commission has outlined an ambitious plan of building a national digital twin of uk infrastructure which aims to demonstrate uk s global leadership in smart infrastructure the digital twin brings together individual infrastructure models and the interdependencies between them through a federated system thus represents a coordinated approach for planning constructing and managing national infrastructure the potential benefits of the national digital twin are apparent optimising use of resources reducing service disruption increasing resilience and boosting quality of life for citizens but how to materialise such benefits through effective policy making remains a big challenge ahead while the digital twin technology is making great strides in the uk with several large scale pilots under construction e g exeter bristol queen elizabeth park in london or being considered e g smart cambridge the varying and changing socio economic and political context of the uk cities implies that the digital twin alone is unlikely to be a one size fits all solution to city challenges for example wh ile congestion has been regarded as a prevailing issue across major cities there are actually fewer commuting journeys per person per week in the uk in than the mid this trend has often been attributed to a wide range of transformations regarding the nature of employment such as more part time work more people working from multiple places e g teleworking increasing self employment e g the gig economy etc such behavioural changes are complex and will have profound implications on how we plan use and manage our future infrastructure however understanding such changes requires an inter disciplinary and collaborative approach the digital twin has great potential for bridging the disciplinary and professional gaps by incorporating data and insights from multiple sectors thus fostering stakeholder debates over complex trade offs the project represents an early trial to address the research gap on city level digital twins it aims to develop a digital twin model prototype for examining the potential impacts of digital transformation on journeys to work in the cambridge sub region the report is organised as follows section introduces the study area section discusses the key research outputs section summarises the potential contributions to a digital built britain through proposing a series of propositions for guiding future research overview of the study area the core study area for this study is the cambridgeshire and peterborough combined authority which consists of local authority districts given the relatively large commuting catchment of cambridge the modelling area is expanded to cover the former greater cambridge and greater peterborough lep area which consists of local authority districts the study area features the fast growing southern areas i e cambridge and south cambridgeshire and the deprived northern areas in the fens which represents a typical uk city region of significant spatial inequality a map of the study area is presented in figure future of travel report by the commission of travel demand https www its leeds ac

map of the study area zones in dark grey the core study area cambridgeshire and peterborough combined authority in terms of the im balance between resident and workplace population in the study region see figure cambridge and peterborough are the only two cities in the study area that have more employed workers than employed residents indicating that workers from other local authorities may have to

research outputs trend in employment growth the investigation of historic data on employment growth by type see figure below shows that the part time employees and the self employed without employees have been growing faster than other employment types in the cambridgeshire and peterborough combined authority compared with the number of self employed without employees has grown times and the part time employees have nearly doubled in in particular the self employed without employees who may be closely related to the gig economy see an ever quicker growth during in the study area the full time employees who account for of the workforce in have seen a steady growth since it can be anticipated that the share of part time workers including both employees and the self employed is likely to raise in the study area supposing the observed trend continues as more people start to engage flexible working e g flexible working hours working from multiple places it is important to investigate the associated impacts on the choice of place of work and journeys to work a city level digital twin experiment for exploring the impacts of digital transformation on journeys to work in the cambridge sub region figure change of employees and the self employed in the cambridgeshire and peterborough combined authority understanding the choice of place of work our statistical analysis using census microdata for the study region confirms that being a self employed either as a freelancer or with employees is more likely to work at from home or have no fixed place than being an employee after controlling the cross sample differences on age socio economic status industry of work broad residence location length of working hours possible childcare duty and housing condition measured by number of persons per room specifically the positive correlation between the age of individual sample and the choice of working at from home indicates a propensity for working at from home when workers get old in the study area higher socio economic status would increase the probability of choosing home working it suggests that high skill jobs e g managerial and professional are more amenable to working at from home than relatively low skill jobs e g semi routine and routine low skill jobs are more likely to have no fixed workplace we also find that the choice of home working is subject to the availability of space in the house as the number of persons per room increases i e higher occupancy level the likelihood of working at from home decreases in the study region the interdependence between home working and housing provision subject to further tests using up to date data may shed a new light on understanding worker s choice of place of work sa emulov deniahc sdnasuoht rebmun

the mode share for commuting from the cpca area to cambridge as the workplace using census data segmented by a km distance interval note that driving car includes only driving in a car van and exclude commuters who are passengers in car the figure also omits other modes of travel motorcycle scooter or moped taxi as by census definition figure mode share and travel volume for commuting by distance band it shows that for distance under km the predominant mode for commuting to cambridge including those commuting within cambridge is bicycle around followed by walking and driving however the mode share for driving increases sharply from km reaching about for km and a striking for km this is accompanied by the quick drop of bicycle mode it is not surprising as cycling over km about min one way for an average speed of km hr on a daily basis may become physically undesirable less than of commuters use bus for communing within the km range the share of bus increases from km but is capped around at around km the share of train for commuting remains under for distance under km with a spike around km range e g waterbeach cambridge and increases to about for km e g newmarket royston cambridge and km e g ely cambridge given the local policy goal of reducing car dependence and promote sustainable travel the shift from car to bus and other non motor modes has been the overarching focus in local transport strategy the figure below shows the ratio of mode share between bus and car around cambridge the purpose of producing the map is to emphasize the spatial heterogeneity in terms of the mode choice of car and public transit to address the desirable shift from car to bus the km commuting distance range is selected within which the bus remains a feasible substitute to car for commuting purpose for commuters as passengers in car account for about of all commuters to cambridge including those commuting within cambridge all other modes account for about of all commuters

there are more than bus commuters for every car commuters there is room for further improvement for employment sites on the fringe e g science park and the biomedical campus the mode ratio between bus and car is generally under indicating less than ten bus commuters by every car commuters the empirical finding suggests that to shift commuters from car to public transit the mobility solutions need to be more targeted in relation to specific locations and commuting corridors and socio economic background of commuters the spatial and social dimension is very important in policy making without which the behavioral changes expected from policy interventions e g shift towards public transit are difficult to fulfil a city level digital twin experiment for exploring the impacts of digital transformation on journeys to work in the cambridge sub region insights from a big data set automatic number plate recognition anpr in addition to the conventional data sources this research taps into a new big data set namely the automatic number plate recognition anpr records to understand the hourly journeys to work patterns in cambridge the local authority is acknowledged for providing the anonymized anpr data the anpr data set applied covers a whole week mon sun in june to link the data with aggregate census data each anpr camera is assigned to a middle layer super output area msoa which is the spatial unit of analysis used in our study during the one week data collection period around vehicles per day can be identified that pass through or stop by cambridge a set of rules are proposed to differentiate commuting cars from non commuting car journeys e g tourism and logistics the following rules are applied for detecting a commuting car which are derived from our own tests a broad travel direction towards the city centre determined by the captured trajectory of the vehicle first appearance time stamp between am pm duration of stay in cambridge area no less than five hours based on the rules reported above approximately vehicles per weekday on average are recognized as commuting vehicles the following figure depicts the total number of commuting vehicles in cambridge by the hour which includes both stationary and on road vehicles it shows that the total number of commuting cars peaks at noon in cambridge figure hourly total number of commuting vehicles in cambridge including both stationary and on road vehicles commuting load by the hour excluding stationary cars can also be obtained from the records see figure the processed data shows that morning peak in cambridge is between am while the afternoon peak is pm the commuting pattern on friday is slightly different from the other workdays with lower volume in both morning and afternoon peak a detailed investigation into the cambridge biomedical campus cbc yields some local insights see figure for instance majority of workers at cbc tend to come to work at am leading to a single point morning peak however the afternoon peak at cbs seems to be more spread than the city as a whole with more workers remain at workplace after pm we deem that such a load pattern is related to the particular working

travel origin destination mode distance time social economic classification household profile etc as proposed in the proposal a web based digital platform is developed to visualize the multi dimensional journeys to work data to prepare the data set we build on the open access census flow data for the study area which include origin and destination by travel mode or national statistics socio economic classification ns sec the original flow data is then expanded by adding the breakdown of ns sec by mode through an established land use and transport model application for the cambridge sub region the expanded data set thus include origin destination travel mode and socio economic classification the socio economic segmentation in the data set which is aggregated from ns sec is summarized in the table below from seg to seg it indicates a decreasing ranking in grade detail information about the structure and methodology of ns sec can be found at ons website the model

work as informed by the workshop outcomes with local authorities the purpose of the cambridge digital twin cdt model is to bridge the sectoral silos of transport housing environment and energy in local policy making these policy themes are jointly selected by the local authorities and the research team as cross cutting policy issues with local urgency the model development follows a policy oriented approach see figure in terms of time horizon the proposed cdt prototype is focused on the medium to long term policy scenarios in terms of modelling scope the cdt prototype aims to quantify some of the interdependences among transport air quality housing and energy infrastructure in the cambridge sub region in relation to background changes in employment and technology it has been identified through workshop and interviews that the future location of businesses employment households and their travel choices is the pivot variable set that connects the selected policy themes a

mode to produce future journeys to work scenarios in the study region informed by the discussion with local authorities two future scenarios are proposed to demonstrate the functionality of the digital twin model prevalence of teleworking and future electric vehicles charging demand which are introduced in turn below scenario teleworking teleworking or remote working represents a flexible way of working without commuting to a central workplace teleworking enables workers to work from home or other locations for some days of the week which thus may reduce the overall commuting demand one of the key modelling assumptions pertains to what kinds of employment are amenable to teleworking in the future see table it is assumed that medium to high skill jobs self employed jobs and clerical and administrative jobs are more prone to teleworking based on this assumption the percentage of jobs subject to teleworking in the study area is summarized in table a total of of jobs about

assumption is in line with the scenario design as in the cpier report see footnote on page for more information about the cpier report a city level digital twin experiment for exploring the impacts of digital transformation on journeys to work in the cambridge sub region to test the possible impacts on commuting due to teleworking a comparative scenario analysis is conducted we first run the digital twin model to generate a baseline scenario for the study region using the assumed employment projection summarized in table the baseline scenario serves as the basis for comparing the relative changes across scenarios recall that the proposed digital twin model can predict both the residence location choice and the mode choice in the baseline scenario both the residence location and the mode choices are simulated by the model technically the prevalence of teleworking would affect both the residence location choice for reduced overall commuting cost per week and the mode choice for likely increased flexibility in working hours nonetheless there is no empirical data available for estimating the elasticity of household relocation with respect to the reduced weekly commuting cost we thus do not consider the possible residence relocation and assume that in the teleworking scenario all employed residents remain their original home location as in the baseline scenario the scenario result is shown in figure figure scenario output potential reduction of commuting flow by all modes due to teleworking in cambridge based on the baseline scenario northstowe impington cambourne comberton fulbourn duxford it shows that the possible impact on commuting is not evenly distributed across the study area the teleworking may reduce the journeys to work both within the city and across city boundary in particular the commuting flow from cambourne comberton northstowe and impington to cambridge may see a significant reduction two policy implications may be drawn from this preliminary impact study of teleworking on commuting first the fast growth of self employed and part time workers in the study area since suggests that flexible working arrangement such as teleworking may become prevalent in the study area the possible impact on journeys to work could be significant in magnitude a city level digital twin experiment for exploring the impacts of digital tra nsformation on journeys to work in the cambridge sub region which poses new challenges to transport demand forecast second the prevalence of teleworking may bring radical changes in terms of the relationship between work and location on the one hand the emerging co working space is blurring the boundary between jobs and workplace teleworkers search for a suitable place to work and fill that workspace but not necessarily a job on the other hand planners developers architects and employers need to consider new models of providing and managing workspace e g hotdesking not simply reducing the floorspace per worker but considering the flexibility and adaptability of space and the wider impacts on workers productivity and welfare some caveats should be noted first literature on tele remote working suggests that the reduction of commuting trips may result in the increase of non commuting trips and the total time budget for travelling in fact remains quite stable over time and among population although teleworking may reduce the demand for commuting for certain types of jobs the impact on overall travel demand is not clear second digital technology is likely to be a key enabler for teleworking it involves a wide range of technology such as cloud platform immersive technology and the underlying physical infrastructure such as fibre broadband mobile connectivity the teleworking scenario in this study does not consider the availability of such technology in specific locations scenario electric vehicles charging demand the design of this scenario is inspired by one particular finding from the workshops and interviews with local authorities replacing the existing combustion engine vehicles with electric vehicles evs is deemed as the ultimate solution to air pollution as it addresses the root of the issue however the large scale take up of evs is subject to the capacity of local electricity grid which is already under considerable strain e g the addenbrooke s hospital area this scenario thus aims to address the interdependences between the environment transport land use and energy system in local policy making this scenario assumes that all vehicles commuting to cambridge including those commuting within cambridge are evs to simplify the energy simulation we do not differentiate the types of evs and assume a uniform electricity consumption per km travelled by evs kwh per km source dft webtag a the electricity charging demand for non commuting use of evs is also not considered the key policy variable in this scenario is the spatial distribution of future housing and employment growth in the study region see figure a total of three alternative spatial development strategies are tested which are in line with the scenario setting in the cpier report see footnote on page for more information about the cpier report the digital twin model predicts how alternative spatial strate gies may affect the distribution of evs charging demand across the study region the prediction for the baseline is presented in figure to highlight the possible impact of nudging people in terms of where to charge the evs we further assume that all commuting evs can only be charged at either workplace or home place the results for the densification and the fringe growth are presented in figure and figure respectively hägerstrand t what

figure evs charging scenario alternative spatial development strategies for cambridge and the environs business as usual baseline extrapolation based on the historic growth pattern for housing and employment densification concentrating the majority of growth within the existing city boundary fringe growth allowing the city to expand outwards on the fringe which requires releasing some greenbelt

journeys to work in the cambridge sub region figure evs charging scenario densification charging at workplace left vs at home place right figure evs charging scenario fringe growth charging at workplace left vs at home place right a city level digital twin experiment for exploring the impacts of digital transformation on journeys to work in the cambridge sub region policy implications of the evs charging scenario are summarised as follows a high level of spatial variance is observed in the distribution of charging demand for commuting evs the further concentration of employment in cambridge as in the densification scenario results in the highest charging demand in cambridge if commuting evs are all charged at workplace upgrading the energy infrastructure in the dense centre of cambridge is likely to be expensive accompanied with severe disruption to local businesses nonetheless the increased electricity demand may be shifted away to other locations in the short term through pro active pricing policy on charging and or parking at workplace as suggested by the comparison between charging at workplace and home place in the figures to make it possible it requires better collaboration between transport housing and energy team in local government the feasibility of shirting evs charging demand between workplace and home place is less in the fringe growth scenario as more workers live in proximity to their workplace the improved job housing balance on the fringe also indicates a reduced average commuting distance compared with the baseline it should be pointed out that the scenario results are rather crude due to the various simplifications in scenario design the purpose of this scenario is thus not to provide an engineering solution for optimizing the distribution of future evs charging demand but to demonstrate the potential of city level digital simulation tools for facilitating cross boundary collaboration in policy making in local government potential contributions to a digital built britain inspired by the uk national infrastructure commission s recommendation for a national digital twin and the recent progress of the digital framework task group and centre for digital built britain this short project explores the concept of a city level digital twin in terms of the design development and application through a modelling case study in cambridge in light of the gemini principles this project also aims to test and verify the high level principles in a real policy context and generate transferable knowledge on city level digital development in additional to the key research outputs discussed in the last section we summarize a series of working propositions regarding the development of city level digital twins which are derived from the cambridge digital twin exercise an early version of these propositions has been presented on the international conference on smart infrastructure and construction icsic in cambridge it is expected that these propositions will guide the future research and practice on city level digital twin and thus contribute to a digital built britain proposition the upscaling from an engineering digital twin to a city level digital twin is not straightforward for a city level digital twin application to be useful and the associated discussion to be meaningful key dimensions of the digital twin need to be articulated pertaining to the purpose boundary context and resolution of the specific digital twin as well as the interdependences among twin models three dimensions of such are proposed in figure policy domains stakeholders denote the subject and representation of the digital twin i e about what and for whom locational context includes the social economic political and geographic background and spatial temporal scale indicates the resolution of the twin model wan et al developing a city level digital twin propositions and a case study international conference on

dimensions for defining a city level digital twin application policy domains stakeholders about what for whom digital twin digital twin digital twin locational context spatial temporal scale proposition digital twin development is a progressive process the digital twin and the social system that creates and uses it must co evolve with each this proposition relates to the intellectual relationship between the digital twin and the human society on the one hand our existing knowledge about cities and societies defines how well we could development and use a city level digital twin on the other hand artificial intelligence ai may eventually become comparable to or even surpass human intelligence in terms of knowledge production and decision making in the wake of recent data misuse and privacy breach incidents e g the cambridge analytica case the co evolving proposition addresses the imperative for harnessing the power of ai through pre emptive measures proposition real time is a relative term the temporal scale of the digital twin should reflect the rate of change of the subject in reality the real time feature as in engineering digital twin applications denotes the low latency in updating the twin model against the reality the transition from a manufacturing product as the subject of a digital replica to a city entails the term real time to be redefined it contests to the simplistic pursuit of high frequency data regardless of the purpose of the digital twin proposition to advance the city level digital twin agenda digital twin applications should be focused on enabling more frequent and effective feedback loop between the twin model stakeholders and the public one major problem of using urban computational models in policy making is the lack or inefficiency of feedback which can manifest itself in various ways e g model as a black box no post analysis validation and the detachment from public engagement from a modelling perspective the implication is that the interaction between the model and the users is far from perfect even for modelling experts new interface thus needs to be explored which can translate data analytics into cogent narratives targeted to various stakeholders to achieve it modellers may have to think beyond models which is apparently more than a technical request proposition to help solving complex policy challenges a realistic use of a city level digital twin is to identify system level risks and inefficiencies of policy interventions and to foster cross disciplinary professional collaboration as opposed to providing a singular model based a city level digital twin experiment for exploring the impacts of digital transformation on journeys to work in the cambridge sub region optimization system level optimization though being the explicit purpose of some digital twins in the engineering sphere may not be an effective approach to address wicked urban problems one of the reasons is that developers of the digital twin given their technical background often do not have enough understanding of the non tec hnical factors e g election cycles hierarchies of decision making institutional constraints these non technical factors are usually highly influential but tend to be very difficult to be incorporated in the model a model based optimization which does not consider such non technical constraints would have little meaning it should be noted that these propositions are neither conclusive nor exhaustive it is expected that the propositions could be further tested and expanded through more empirical research conclusions the digital twin technology represents one of the latest technical trends for smartening our cities however the roadmap to develop a city national level digital twin is not yet clear this project represents a timely effort to explore a policy oriented strategy for developing a city level digital twin prototype for the cambridge sub region key research outputs are discussed and a series of propositions are proposed for guiding the future research on city level digital twin the project is nothing but a small step towards the ambition of creating a national digital twin for the uk infrastructure it is expected that more and more empirical evidence will be gathered to establish a new body of knowledge for leveraging and regulating the power of digital twins as discussed in one of the propositions the development of a digital twin is a progressive process where the digital twin and the social system that creates and uses it must co evolve with each

offers significant opportunities for organisations to innovate and grow but there are inherent risks that need to be addressed mr martin khoo principal lecturer consultant digital strategy leadership practice nus iss speaking at the nus iss virtual learning festival on the topic the importance of cybersecurity for digital transformation a report by check point research revealed that the asia pacific apac region witnessed the highest year on year increase in weekly cyberattacks during the first quarter of on average each organisation in apac is hit by attacks per week why is our region a hotbed for cybercrime several factors are at play says mr martin khoo principal lecturer consultant digital strategy leadership practice nus iss these include rapid digital transformation a young digital savvy population the rise of hybrid work and collaboration technologies it s therefore imperative that cybersecurity is incorporated into the digital transformation process from the get go martin emphasises additionally it is the responsibility of all stakeholders government agencies in various countries will need to develop national level programmes businesses will have to invest in cybersecurity at the organisation level while individuals like you and me need to know how to protect ourselves and our data from threat actors key cybersecurity considerations how can organisations mitigate the risks associated with digital transformation and improve their security posture martin highlights three areas risk assessment incident response and recovery and continuous monitoring and testing digital transformation introduces new risks especially regarding data security and privacy he says organisations must assess these risks and develop a cybersecurity strategy to address them as businesses collect more customer data they have a duty of care to make sure these data are managed securely compliance with regulations such as pdpa in singapore and gdpr in europe is crucial but despite best efforts no system is entirely immune to cyber threats organisations need an incident response plan to quickly and effectively manage incidents when they occur regular testing and exercising of the plan are essential particularly for regulated sectors like banking and finance on top of that proactive monitoring of it infrastructure is crucial for detecting and responding to threats promptly regular vulnerability assessments and penetration testing help identify and mitigate potential weaknesses before attackers exploit them martin adds two ways to do so are through vulnerability assessment where you scan your environment to identify and patch weak spots or penetration testing where you put on the hat of an attacker and try to penetrate your own system aligning cyber security strategy with business outcomes a cybersecurity strategy is not developed in isolation it needs to be crafted to align with the organisation s broader business goals and objectives says martin the strategy translates into an actionable plan that enhances the organisation s cybersecurity posture and resilience at this stage the cybersecurity strategy should focus on overarching goals and outcomes and be technology agnostic he adds typically a cybersecurity strategy spans three to five years but a regular review is crucial ideally on an annual basis this is because the cybersecurity landscape is dynamic with new threats constantly emerging regular review ensures that the strategy remains relevant and effective in addressing evolving threats on the organisation level a cybersecurity strategy https www iss nus edu sg community newsroom news detail the secret to securing your digital transformation the secret to securing your digital transformation should be a key decision item for the board martin stresses that it will require the endorsement and approval of the board as well as the commitment to provide the necessary funding without adequate funding it is challenging to implement the initiatives outlined in the strategy effectively he explains cybersecurity needs to be powered by skilled talent last but not least a robust cybersecurity strategy has to be supported by skilled cybersecurity personnel who can implement and manage the necessary initiatives take for example the national cybersecurity strategies in singapore and the united states they both highlight the importance of building a strong pool of trained cybersecurity professionals to address the evolving cyber threats in singapore initiatives such as the talent development fund were launched as part of singapore cybersecurity strategy to build a pipeline of skilled cybersecurity talent institutes of higher learning such as nus iss also offer a range of cybersecurity certification programmes to increase the pool of cybersecurity trained personnels to meet industry needs as businesses continue to embark on their digital transformation journeys cybersecurity will remain a critical enabler it can even become a competitive advantage says martin in today s data driven world customers are increasingly concerned about the security of their personal information by

broadly categorised into four dimensions customers business capabilities and people and leadership issues this course covers the customer and business dimensions the customer dimension looks at how a desirable customer value proposition cvp is derived from the following leading digital transformation here are the most important skills it leaders need to have leading digital transformation here are the most important skills it leaders need to have by damien cummings chief digital strategy and leadership practice the covid pandemic has accelerated digital transformation in all sectors and regions by several years and as we enter the new normal this unprecedented change is reshaping southeast asia in exciting ways the vibrant region is home to a booming startup sector with rising consumer classes and a demographic advantage on its side over percent of the world s youths live in the asia pacific apac and southeast asia is leading the region s digital transformation with million people becoming digital consumers since from the rise of e commerce and fintech to hybrid work taking center stage as economies reopen the region holds immense opportunities but despite having a young population ready to embrace the online platforms and social media not everyone is keeping up with the changes fast enough a huge digital skills gap is weighing down on all sectors around the world given the intense demands of new software and infrastructures as well as new ways of working a regional research report by amazon web services aws and consulting firm alphabeta revealed that by the average worker in apac will need to learn seven new digital skills the number of apac workers requiring digital skills will grow over five fold which means that across southeast asia and singapore specifically billion digital training will be required across the entire workforce what these mean for businesses is that there is and will be constant change those in leadership roles will need to have the right skills not necessarily technical ones to deal with the disruptions ahead in order to ensure their organisation is future ready setting your organisation up to be part of the percent the reality is many digital transformation programmes fail a study by boston consulting group arrived at an alarming conclusion percent of digital transformations fail falling short of their objectives and often producing profound consequences to champion a successful digital transformation project leaders need to be equipped with these five critical skills digital leadership most of the time what s missing in an organisation s digital transformation roadmap is a clear set of goals that differentiates the project from standard digitisation it s not about giving everyone access to zoom so they can work from home during a pandemic rather an example of digital transformation would be to fundamentally shift from a physical retail model to e commerce to reach more consumers who would otherwise not visit the store an important yet often overlooked aspect of digital leadership is to ensure that the entire organisation is digitally upskilled no matter what industr y you are in businesses are becoming digital businesses and this means that everyone needs to be digitally literate from the frontline intern all the way up to the ceo everyone needs to be on the same page in terms of the ease of working with technological tools for productivity collaboration and leveraging data to enhance their work overcoming resistance and managing change despite the promises of new technologies in terms of efficiency ease of use and better customer experience many digital transformations fail due to employees unwillingness to change and poor organizational practices to overcome this resistance there are three c s that can help communication collaboration and commitment successful leaders talk about the why rather than focusing on the what they are the ones who are down there in the trenches trying to understand the work of their employees and applying empathy while communicating the reasons behind the changes that are happening this turns the digital transformation into a collaborative process and builds a sense of purpose and belonging within the team pointing them towards an aligned direction commitment is about walking the talk and taking the lead if you re implementing a new tech tool be the role model use it yourself and champion it excellent people management good team members have a flow on effect inside an organisation they create virtuous circles which have a significant tangible impact on the team that they work in and help to create a conducive productive environment to work in google spent years studying how effective teams look like and how to build high performing teams what they realised ultimately is that it doesn t really matter who s on the team rather it s about how the team works together the most critical element is that leaders need to develop an environment of https www iss nus edu sg community newsroom news detail leading digital transformation here are the most important skills it le leading digital transformation here are the most important skills it leaders need to have psychological safety this could be anything from the ability to take risks to share controversial ideas and have a debate or dialogue and to know that it s not going to be career threatening if you don t agree with your manager such an environment will help employees to feel that the work they do actually matters become a champion of data a study by hfs research found that percent of business executives do not have a high level of trust in their data and percent do not consider their data architecture to be world class this is worrying as data literacy the ability to read understand and communicate data in context is important no matter where an organisation is on its digital transformation journey the advice is to start with basic digital training for all employees just to ensure everyone is singing from t he same songbook having a base level of digital training will ensure that they can refer back and use it as a basis for common language when discussing data related processes self awareness and reflection while percent of people believe they re self aware in reality just percent to percent actually are and why does this trait matter on a personal level self awareness helps you understand and cope with stress at work it can help you match your skill sets better collaborate more efficiently and enhance your relationships as it leads to a greater level of openness and communication one way to improve your self awareness is to gather feedback not just through official appraisal systems but also to check in with your team and even engage friends or colleagues for honest feedback no leader is an island ultimately the key takeaway from the five skills above is that successful digital transformation takes a village it s not possible for an it leader to implement changes alone what you ll need is organisation wide buy in and collaboration across departments the challenge is to engage every stakeholder from the frontline staff all the way through the c level executives and board members and take them along that journey even if change is difficult help them to understand that they have personal and organisational impact in the work that they are doing and empower them to see the eventual positive outcome of this digital transition and they ll be your best allies in taking digital transformation

practitioners and scholars have discussed the business model bm concept since the late s during the emerging scholars have explored the dt phenomenon throughout digital era despite its already longstanding debate many sectors such as banking health services there is no single definition of bm some authors define it manufactured goods media and publishing industries as being logic description history commerce and transportation in the system and even an architecture of latter new business models bms under dt are gaining room how an enterprise competes in a given market the same can among other modes of transportation ride hailing services be said regarding bm s building blocks according to their e g uber cabify and lyft bike sharing e g grin nice research objectives

governance is derived from what type of businesses formed relied extensively on xerox s hierarchy the previously elements are submitted underexploited technologies while some spin offs designed very distinct bms to operate on the market others stick to later the same authors in reference build upon their xerox s logic previous discussions suggesting another definition we conceptualize a firm s business model as a system of under this technological point of view defines bm as interdependent activities that transcends the focal firm and a revenue architecture that dictates how a firm exploits the spans its boundaries p the activity system perspective latent value of a given technology therefore a bms is how a considers that a given firm conducts a particular set of firm will capture the value created by technological innovation activities derived from existing resources and competencies under a specific structure and governance activities are linked teece uses the same term architecture to describe a in each structure with precise order and distribution among bm but the author goes further than teece revisits agents meanwhile activities are governed through contracts

likewise reference the understanding of bm as an matter presents a co citation analysis involving the bm architecture evokes magretta s definition of bm as a story literature this analysis presumes that as two works are cited it implies that both interrelations among elements and their together the greater are the chances of both being correlated in final disposition matters to the big picture at the same time in content thus being able to build clusters from considering it as being an architecture of the value creation bibliographic data with co cited papers the authors in use delivery and

vehicles through manual key handover and the csos managed their car fleets using reservation and roundtrip rentals users were required to book a vehicle for some time use it and return it to the same parking space they first initiated the service to end later during the s cooperatives also adopted the new digital technologies in their offerings allowing instantaneous access to their shared vehicles keeping their roundtrip nature withal business to consumer b c roundtrip emerged alongside with the digitization of carsharing this category refers to for profit organizations mobilizing a private car fleet that offer services to final consumers operators require users to return the vehicles to the same starting position likewise cooperatives scholars also suggested that b c roundtrip operators have been using exclusive parking spaces both in public and private spaces in daimler benz launched its carsharing service in germany named cargo different from fig carsharing business models and their subtypes what has been offered by previous operators until then cargo did not offer roundtrip carsharing daimler s value proposition b brazilian carsharing in perspective deepened

investigation based on multiple case studies related membership one one one city to active csos in the brazilian market reference states span city city international national international that case studies are ideal for complex and recent phenomena that the researcher does not control at the same time they are international an ideal tool in investigating research questions based on what key public public public city partnerships transit transit transit related and how thus the research question that guided this paper city cit y city partner was what are the main resources and competencies being related related related mobilized by brazilian csos for distinctive business models partners partners partners car car the central construct utilized to determine the main resources related related and competencies was the business model concept while the partners partners distinctions between carsharing bms were extracted from operator non non non non background incumbent incumbent incumbent incumbent reference synthesized in fig incumbent incumbent for case selection we considered the following criteria a the organization should be directly involved in offering

only cso operating under a bm that from crunchbase an online database that gathers information remane and colleagues had not discussed instead it focuses from research institutions public agencies investors and on corporative carsharing business to business or b b an media companies regarding companies around the world the in depth exposition for each case is presented next user can search for

brazil which cso location business model yielded results each of them was checked using the criteria alfa sao paulo sp brazil p p manual access resulting in exclusions three enterprises did not maintain a website three did not present their direct involvement in corporative carsharing or carsharing operations and three were defunct by beta sao paulo sp brazil business to business b b the second source for our case selection was journalistic b c one way documentation from local lay media searches were conducted gama recife pe brazil stationary between june and january and considered b

started operations in the first a alfa half of no exclusions were necessary in total csos alfa is a startup located in sao paulo dedicated to p p were found in brazil for the reference year all of which were manual access carsharing since alfa has intermediates for profit organizations and were considered to compose this transactions between mobility consumers and car owners study nevertheless three refused or could not answer our through its digital platform that can be accessed via a invitation in time for data analysis the remaining csos smartphone application in the first two years the organization named alfa beta gama and delta were operating under was limited to sao paulo s state but rapidly expanded to the different bms and were successfully incorporated in this study national level in research protocols were defined under semi structured in terms of value creation alfa relies on the twofold value interviews with ceos ctos and other managers and team proposition on the one hand it offers facilitated car rental leaders from the carsharing operators the content of the services to mobility consumers user certification vehicle interviews was based upon definition for bm that is an booking payment transaction validation vehicle architecture of the value creation delivery and capture documentation and insurance services are all conducted via p therefore questions were formulated to alfa s platform with only key handover requiring users to determine how the selected csos created delivered and meet physically on the other hand alfa appeals to car owners captured value in the brazilian market in offering means to generate additional revenue via idle access to the csos were limited each enterprise assets that is it guarantees secure transactions to car owners allowed only one interviewee to participate in presential and during carsharing remote interactions we used secondary data gathered from the since alfa s business process still requires vehicle booking journalistic material accumulated during the case selection and a certain level of premeditation to demand the service its phase and information presented in csos websites to value propositions target users interested in carsharing for guarantee data triangulation more extended periods than on demand mobility services the data analysis was conducted utilizing the content analysis interviewee declared that most vehicle bookings occurred for technique presented by this method allows the researcher holidays and weekends at the same time alfa s tariff model to organize non structured data into constructs conceived also is projected to sustain this segment since it is based on specially for data analysis following the analysis made by daily rates rather than hourly or by the minute rates as in ride remane and colleagues we were able to define some hailing and in some b c operators alfa frequently constructs that could portrait the different bm pillars offered holiday and weekend bundles to foster transactions in mentioned by teece s definition we considered value its platform proposition and marke t segment as proper constructs for value in sum the primary resource for alfa is its digital platform creation value delivery is directly related to which resources unlike the other cases presented alfa is entirely dependent on competencies and suppliers are mobilized to sustain the firm s its virtual community to create deliver and capture value value proposition and reach its target market finally value thus competencies related to software development backend capture was represented by the enterprise s revenue streams frontend and user experience are essential to the business when offering carsharing services the results obtained from data analysis were iteratively compared with existing academic although its leaner approach to carsharing alfa faces literature regarding carsharing bms our study reached closure different challenges which do not

instead it allocated its vehicles near parks and pub houses in in its platform the required individual insurance certifies that public parking spaces customers were required to download the vehicle fulfills the minimum security requirements for beta s smartphone application to access its vehicles remotely sharing hence alfa retains organizational structures the software was developed by a third party and used by beta specialized in anti fraud techniques to inhibit misappropriation and free rider behavior this bm design was financially unsustainable in any case many vehicles were lost to theft vandalism floods and other another challenge alfa faces is a significant imbalance damages with no specific parking spaces and proper between car owners and mobility consumers at the moment of monitoring mechanisms at the end of the parent the interview the organization held around users with organization sold beta to another society that rapidly redesigns only car owners such disproportion directly hinders its bm to accommodate corpora tive carsharing the new alfa s virtual community expansion due to the lack of a management sought partnerships with small car rental consistent supply of

to the similarity system submitted accepted published editor gildenir carolino santos rdbci campinas sp v e introduction promoting social development through digital transformation in the world of work in a post pandemic environment is as challenging as it is promising after all opportunities often arise in unpredictable moments of crisis and consequently unexpected changes public libraries are at the center of these changes and opportunities in the networked information century this phenomenon requires information professionals to take a proactive approach to innovation innovation is comprehensive and transversal so we adopt as conception of innovation the development of new products and services with innovative methods and actions such as for example citizen labs ideas incubators virtual learning environments creative spaces and participatory environments enabling access to online collections and digital information these innovations which when put into practice bring improvement to a service product or process existing in a library contributing to make the lives of people who use the products and services offered by it easier the mapping of scientific literature to identify the evolution of the theme innovation in the field of information science carried out by gabriel júnior sousa and silva p states that it is very difficult to have a definition of innovation that meets all areas and contexts in the ic area innovation is very much characterized as a process of improvement or transformation of processes and services in ci the concept of innovation as a development or improvement of processes and services occurs mainly with the insertion or updating of new technologies and also transformations and modifications in management processes this type of innovation in existing processes is always thought of to meet the demands of a specific group of users of information services for some types of institutions that offer information services innovation in services and products offered becomes a more difficult process due to the aforementioned costs necessary for the effective implementation of new services gabriel junior sousa and silva discuss two types of libraries very common in brazil the public library and the university library about the first the authors state that it has enormous potential for innovation as from the information and communication technologies icts because they enable better interaction between users products and services favoring autonomy in tasks related to the services offered by the library however it is pointed out as the main challenge the fundraising for the appropriate investment in these technologies given the reality of public libraries in the country notoriously known as precarious from the point of view of economic investment from public policies in relation to the second the authors point out as a barrier the lack of knowledge for the library s maintainers of the importance of innovation to generate value because they perceive it as a conventional space gabriel junior sousa and silva point out that the concept of innovation in a university library should also be associated with the development and improvement of products and services related to scientific communication since a large part of its public is made up of researchers and students who need scientific information to carry out their activities and develop their research it is important to mention that both in the study by gabriel júnior sousa and silva the most updated scientific mapping on the theme innovation in the ic field and in all the scientific literature investigated as from the research that originated the present article there is no approach on innovation in libraries of federal institutes which currently in brazil play an educational role in the public sector in a more comprehensive way than university libraries for serving users linked to the secondary technical and higher education level and for being present in a widely distributed manner throughout the national territory this gap begins rdbci campinas sp v e to be filled with this article the first of a series of publications that intends to address the issue with the intent of dev eloping it in the scientific and professional field with a view to both the public educational library and the librarians work beyond the library in other spaces suitable for their work in innovation ecosystems during the pandemic period between the years and professionals from various fields learned new lessons about the most diverse issues that interfere with lifestyles and ways of life as we know them this was a landmark of significant changes including changes in the world of work and employment among several the issue of changes in the way of life at work especially the future of remote work and the role of public educational libraries in this dynamic context in brazil interested the present study during enancib the authors of the present article proposed that these are libraries that support with info educational actions the teaching research and extension practices developed by public educational institutions whose function is educational and their nature is public conceptually from the perspective of their organizational identity public educational libraries were defined as information units with a priority educational purpose and of public nature which meet the information needs of both the academic public at all levels of teaching needs and skills and the technical administrative public and the community in general through info educational actions the collection of such institutions can be made up of works that are multicultural extracurricular and linked to the lifelong learning process covering all age groups without distinction the libraries of the federal institutes are an example of this type of information unit in brazil however this does not exclude other libraries to identify themselves in this organizational identity being necessary to deepen the theme in future studies two points constitute the starting point that inspired this research first the observation of the recent transformations that have occurred in the working environments of the communities to which the authors of this article are linked carried out during doctoral research second the contemporary reflection woven by an experienced north american professor about the innovation that has emerged over time in public libraries author of many books and articles about the policymaking process and how to improve the management of public organizations steve kelman professor of public administration at harvard university published on august in the traditional and renowned american blog about federal public administration fcw federal computer week an article entitled in its translation public libraries and government innovation this article is the focal point of the reflection that originated the present research and discussion it is usual that at the core of discussions on public information policies in the field of information science ic in brazil a convergence is sought in an interdiscipl inary way between what is said in the scientific literature of the administration field and public administration with the ic literature itself and librarianship in numerous instances however recently the debate on sustainable development urban infrastructure and smart cities has gained notoriety and broadened the interdisciplinary range of issues investigated in this scientific field this occurs due to the evidencing of the urgency in solving and dealing with climate issues for human survival on planet earth and its unfolding which include rethinking the quality of life at work and the need for presence in diverse situations and environments it has been a trend therefore that professionals and researchers from other fields of knowledge with emphasis in this discussion on the field of architecture and urbanism become interested in public libraries and their social function in urban spaces historically there is an evolution in the appreciation of libraries as civic spaces beyond the idea of exclusive spaces for the promotion of reading and books defended throughout the th century as places primarily for study and research kelman mentions in his article his satisfaction in recently coming across the article by liz mccormick a summer urban scholar at new urban mechanics in boston usa rdbci campinas sp v e who works on management innovations for the city the article titled in translation the radical potential of libraries mentions new ways of library use following the pandemic and was published on the city of boston s institutional blog specifically on the page of the mayor s office of new urban mechanics which is a kind of research and development laboratory in boston and also serves as a civic incubator for ideas within the city government in europe there has been a lot of talk about the implementation of distributed citizen labs in public libraries initiatives such as the recent offer of the course laboratorios ciudadanos distribuidos available at https curso labsbibliotecarios es for librarians and professionals from brazil in the distance learning modality promoted by the ministry of culture and sports of spain through the general direction of books and reading promotion demonstrates the importance of the theme and of the insertion of libraries in the context of citizen innovation diego garcia coordinator of the libraries laboratories project of the mentioned spanish ministry highlighted at the beginning of the course through a speech broadcast on the youtube platform on april th the importance of reinforcing the role of libraries as meeting and collaborative learning spaces where the promotion of democratic values is guaranteed distributed citizen labs conceptually can be understood in a broader and more complete way from the perspective of social researcher lorena ruiz p disseminated within the first module of the course promoted by the ministry of culture and sport of spain divided into six aspects namely chart distributed citizen labs defined in aspects aspect conceptual perspective first the citizen lab is a new form of institution one in which openness accessibility and re appropriability predominate in a citizen lab people can make proposals and thus become producers of their own or other people s ideas rather than consumers of something predetermined by the institution second a citizen lab is a meeting space for different actors to collaborate on the development of a shared idea third participation in a citizen lab is its connection to its closest environment regarding this aspect it is about valuing the culture of proximity prioritizing the meeting and cooperation between different actors linked to the same context a neighborhood a city an organization etc the laboratory is therefore a tool for listening and observing what happens in these contexts trying to identify the community s needs desires resources and strengths that can be put into action to develop collective ideas fourth the laboratory works in a specific way from the logic of experimentation and prototyping this is one of the most characteristic and relevant features of the proposal of a citizen laboratory because it implies prioritizing the process over the result accepting uncertainty and supporting it collectively and relating directly with error understanding it as another learning resource experimentation due to its open provisional and even playful nature allows the diverse knowledge of all participants to be brought together and thus promotes cooperation and the creation of bonds particularly of trust and reciprocity fifth the articulation of diverse actors around the development of a common idea generates a large volume of knowledge a citizen lab is not only a space in which this production of knowledge is possible but also a tool so that the knowledge generated continues to circulate after the lab is over and can be useful in other contexts to achieve this we work from the principles of free culture freedom to copy distribute modify and improve other people s creations documenting the work done in the development of each idea sixth and last the conceptual positioning and the main characteristics we have indicated respond to the fundamental purpose of a citizen lab to create communities of learning and practice these communities are intended to be spaces to collectively test forms of self management knowledge production and coexistence because in a laboratory people participate who for the most part do not know each other and have not chosen to work together and therefore it is necessary to establish a learning relationship with others all this with the aim of improving the conditions of rdbci campinas sp v e coexistence in our neighborhoods our cities or our instit utions in short in those places that are close and meaningful to those who inhabit them source chart organized based on the conceptual perspective of lorena ruiz p the purpose of the distributed citizen labs according to ruiz perspective evidenced in the sixth aspect matches the action science method almeida perucchi freire in which it is used the creation of learning communities called research community in the context of application of the scientific method being this critical for obtaining results thinking about the possibility of convergence between a work agenda in the library and a research agenda with a group of researchers linked to the library for innovation it is inferred that the implementation and or the development of citizen labs distributed in libraries can be part of the methodological strategy for socialization of information fostering the generation of new knowledge development of actions for information competence and for digital competencies in line with the assumption of the social responsibility of information science according to mccormick libraries have served since the period of the industrial revolution as a welcoming point for newly arrived immigrants to learn engage and gain support in their quest for american citizenship other possibilities are noted by kelman from other reports namely recreational use of the library by teenagers after school hours use of computers and the internet in the library to resolve legal matters and use of the library to entertain children with storytelling historically in brazil the library spaces have always been used in various recreational and formative ways beyond the storage of the bibliographic collection during the pandemic these spaces were physically limited making it impossible for people to attend exhibitions lectures training sessions classes and other cultural and educational activities that have always been possible in library environments information and education services have migrated to virtual learning environments with this reading and communication habits and practices including the ways of learning were even if temporarily modified to adapt to the restrictions of the pandemic period and the proper continuity of the activities the pandemic period was not the first historical moment that demanded innovation from libraries while in the united states of america libraries were important in welcoming immigrants since the industrial revolution in brazil libraries were and still are welcoming places for people in conditions of social and economic vulnerability in the post pandemic context without restrictions of physical presence in the library environment it may return to its normal performance but probably having to innovate before the changes in the informational behavior of people which was influenced by the pandemic period certainly new demands will emerge regardin g the offer of products and services within the hybridism of current times given this observation kelman asks what will happen after libraries are reopened in a safer more vaccinated world mccormick is also concerned about this future of the library in the post pandemic context and reports on the development of work between his office the boston public library and the city s department of the environment in which they are experimenting with developing two overlapping ideas namely how can libraries evolve into remote workspaces and serve the community by playing a critical role in heat resilience as boston gets hotter such a question emerges after a year of closing physical access to libraries during the pandemic period the work developed by mccormick makes it possible to note that urban climate resilience is one of the contemporary environmental issues where the library can effectively contribute as we will see in the discussion presented in this paper starting in the rdbci campinas sp v e second section given the above our research question took therefore the following contour how can public educational libraries in brazil evolve into remote workspaces and serve the diverse communities of professionals who work and communicate in networks the objective of this article was to discuss the evolution of public educational libraries into remote workspaces to serve a community of professionals who work and communicate in a network one of the most relevant points that interested the research was to know the possibilities of innovation in the public sector through remote work and the role of public educational libraries in this context from the perspective of information science methodological procedures of the research methodologically the research is characterized as exploratory of qualitative approach developed through bibliographic research and elaborated from ongoing doctoral research which makes use of the science action method as a technique the research uses reflection in action to obtain scientific evidence and analyze data that culminates in the formulation of proposals relevant to the scientific and professional context we compared the data on the reality of north american public libraries obtained by bibliographic collection based on the reports of researchers and librarians working in this context with the brazilian reality this comparison resulted in the production of a reflection focused on the performance of the libraries of the federal institutes classified by the authors of this study as public educational libraries in a pioneering way in the field of information science in brazil chloé valdary s enchantment theory is applied as a strategy of methodological approach to produce a critical reflection about innovation in the public sector emphasizing the subjectivity inherent to human relations at work statistical data from recent surveys by the institute f or applied economic research ipea and the brazilian institute of geography and statistics ibge were also consulted to support this reflective study with evidence the reflection presented in the following sections was structured in three parts which address the triad innovation remote work and public educational libraries in theoretical correlation with the possibilities of scientific and professional action based on the purpose of highlighting a necessary debate in the field of information science in the st century specifically such debate subsidizes the evolution of studies on public information policies in libraries and their social implications in brazil the present study was carried out with the support of two research groups the result of an inter institutional partnership between the research group on project management in education science information and technology projecit from the instituto federal da paraíba ifpb and the research group communication networks and information policies from the universidade federal do rio de janeiro ufrj part of the data obtained in the present investigation is also the result of doctoral research in progress at the graduate program in information science ppgci at the federal university of paraíba ufpb the present article therefore is the result of collaborative and integrative work in the scientific community where to start thinking about innovation through remote work to get to the answer to the question that gives this section its title we start from kelman s n p perception of innovation in american public libraries when discussing specifically the public library s contributions to urban climate resilience in boston based on the work developed by mccormick n p highlighting that during the pandemic the library system implemented free outdoor wi fi spaces at locations while branches were closed providing secure outdoor internet access the libraries created rdbci campinas sp v e six shaded work areas to make the free wi fi easier to access and more fun to use they have set up picnic tables an outdoor café and misting tents outside the libraries as well some of which have already been set up as places to alleviate borrowing requests although kelman is not sure why so much innovation has emerged over time in american public libraries while some other government organizations themselves remain tied to conventional practices he points to it being due to the general lack of political controversy surrounding public libraries the researcher notes that usually government innovation arises from crises and threats but that it is different with libraries what drives innovation in libraries is their organizational security which fosters the confidence and self confidence of innovators this may be a favorable and preponderant factor for innovators to find in the library a favorable space for creativity and innovation not only in the united states but also in brazil this point is no different from the brazilian reality as we have observed in recent decades however when it comes to innovation in public libraries it is not quite like that for it is a complex issue corroborating with kelman we infer that the reality of these information units suggests that more organizational security favors the creation of space for innovators to approach change with confidence and self confidence both in the united states and in what we can estimate in brazil from the evidence collected mccormick makes us reflect that in times of instability around the world where trust in public institutions has diminished and continues to be threatened public libraries remain highly trusted public entities she correlates this trustworthiness given to the library to a public from all neighborhoods various age groups and generally by a diverse audience she concludes her article by mentioning that despite the gradual replacement of physical records of knowledge by the world of digital information the role of libraries remains more important than ever this position coming from a professional from another area outside the field of librarianship and information science is critical to validate and legitimize the discourse of librarians who fight for more investment and better working conditions to offer new and better services and that has often been discredited by public managers in one of the recent publications of the federal council of librarianship herrera p librarian of the public library of the city of san francisco in the united states justifies the relevance of innovation in libraries highlighting that today and in the future libraries must constantly reinvent themselves we can remain loyal to our core mission of providing access to information and promoting reading however we need to re examine the traditional model to shift the focus more toward bringing the library to the people this means that we need to reshape service models to one that is more proactive in community outreach and to offer services that target the user we also need to make our libraries more accessible as community spaces for education and civic engagement now is the time to reinvent the way we do our work librarians have remarkable skill sets to help build community teach the new knowledge and redefine our public libraries as learning and knowledge centers of the st century that will help solidify the information digital and social divide data from the survey conducted by the national system of public libraries indicate that there are public libraries throughout the brazilian territory considering the sum of municipal district state and federal libraries which would offer an approximate average of one public library for every inhabitants snbp there is no disclosure of separate data between levels of gov ernment despite this the brazilian institute of geography and statistics ibge released in data from the municipal basic information survey munic which pointed to a reduction in the number of municipalities with public libraries by over a four year interval in the period from to it is assumed therefore from the reports and the observed data that there is a possibility of greater stability within state and federal libraries compared to the municipal rdbci campinas sp v e reality this may vary according to the economic conditions of each municipality after all there are exceptions and the case of são paulo is one of them considered one of the municipalities that stand out in the valorization and quality of public libraries such as the mário de andrade library which is municipal and the award winning villa lobos park library which is statewide in brazil data from the brazilian institute of geography and statistics ibge in already pointed out record numbers of remote work in the home office format even before the covid pandemic the number reached million brazilians working in this condition in the mentioned year ibge points out that at the time the home office work regime became an alternative to circumvent unemployment disclosing the data silveira n p highlights that according to ibge the home office corresponded to of all employed workers in the country excluding public sector employees and domestic workers compared to when the historical series of the survey began this contingent increased by the home office highlighted the ibge fell between and grew in and fell again by in between and it grew by góes martins and nascimento published through the institute for applied economic research ipea a conjuncture letter in the first half of which presents official government statistical data on remote work in brazil based on the year such data was also published by agência brasil a public news agency of the federal government which confirms its relevance for governmental decision making processes in brazil serving as a basis also to compose the evidence of studies and scientific research on the subject this survey pointed out that there was a decrease in the number of home office workers in the month of november however the number remains much higher than the million pointed out by the ibge in being registered approximately million in the recent ipea survey brasil the recorded drop is natural considering the proximity of the pandemic control observed from the advancement in safety protocols and vaccination and gradual return to normality what is currently raising questions especially in the field of public policies which also interests information science in terms of information policies is the permanence and or transf er of in person activities to the remote work format exclusively or as a hybrid the advantages and disadvantages of this migration and the conditions of viability and permanence of this work model the most recent fact in the post pandemic brazilian context which contributes to innovation in the public service is the publication of decree of may which regulates telework and productivity control in the federal public service under the executive branch the greatest innovation provided by the decree consists in the autonomy for the top directors of the entities of the indirect federal public administration which includes federal public autarchies and foundations to authorize the implementation of the management and performance program pgd which was previously restricted to the ministers of state the untying favors the reduction of bureaucracy in the implementation of the program the normative act improves both the management of results of public agencies and agents and the rules related to telework with this telework will now be possible on a part time or full time basis in federal institutes and universities this government innovation in brazil was possible due to the successful experience with remote work during the covid pandemic in an increasingly digital reality it has become evident to public managers the viability of telecommuting in the public sector the measure can contribute to the reduction of costs of the public machine can favor the cultural change of time and attendance control by controlling results and the quality of public services and can also result in higher quality of life for federal civil servants better productivity and serve as an example for governments at the municipal rdbci campinas sp v e and state levels to rethink the form of work adopted without compromising the efficiency of public power and encouraging professional performance in accordance with the objectives of sustainable development the evidence of innovation through remote work and the correlation with libraries have been noticed in scientific works in the field of information science we highlight the increasing approaches about coworking and other innovative spaces chart in the molds of the present research structured from bibliographic research and with a qualitative approach the study by moyses mont alvão and zattar is one of the examples of a recent scientific publication that points out these innovative spaces in libraries the spaces noted in the research are maker spaces learning commons and coworking spaces which according to the researchers make the library more active collaborative creative and innovative which differs from traditional models that emphasize the consumption of knowledge moyses mont alvão zattar p chart innovative library spaces these are spaces qualified to function as incubators of ideas in the most diverse areas which favor creativity experimentation and entrepreneurship in them makerspaces community spirit and collaboration are stimulated and technologies and tools are made available to create individual and collective projects these are spaces that are conducive to collaborative learning they consist of a learning commons meeting space to discuss projects and hold meetings they are created as an alternative to classrooms informal learning environments these are spaces that have the objective of sharing the physical structure furniture rental costs and a commercial address which allows an environment conducive to coworking the exchange of experiences the sharing of knowledge the participation in events and training programs source chart organized based on research by moyses mont alvão and zattar p regarding the exemplification of these spaces we have that maker spaces in brazil as mentioned by moyses mont alvão and zattar p are present in school libraries and also in public libraries the example of initiatives such as in the villa lobos park library bvl that hold maker workshops that teach different activities such as book production robotics home maintenance with a focus on different user profiles also has an inclusive and accessible environment with several assistive technology devices such as page flipper ergonomic table autonomous reader audio player ruler rail adapted keyboard and mouse computers with screen reader adapted mouse and keyboard has already been indicated as one of the best in the world for its illuminated environment spaciousness and democratic space it has also been classified as an active library whose architecture itself favors the reader s experience besides stimulating and facilitating activities of multiple natures moyses mont alvão and zattar p cite the são paulo library another state public library as an example of learning commons it was conceived to be a bold space and offer comfort autonomy and attention to users seen as central elements of the library it occupies an area of square meters to meet the needs of different user profiles it has technological resources and makes microcomputers wireless and self service terminals available it was inspired by the santiago library in chile and was nominated in as one of the best in the world the concepts are very similar within a collaborative space proposal we can affirm that in some libraries there is the presence of two or more of these spaces in the research by moyses mont alvão and zattar p the researchers again point to the parque villa rdbci campinas sp v e lobos library bvl of the state of são paulo sp this time to make mention of the coworking space it contains in bvl opened a coworking space on the second floor of the library which corresponds to a shared workroom with infrastructure an d wi fi network for use by micro and small companies startups or people with projects or ventures in development the projects selected through a public notice can use the room free of charge for ten months in return they must offer workshops or seminars in the project s specialty for of the public all these innovative spaces converge towards the idea of a library that aims to be a center of socialization and conviviality moyses mont alvão zattar p libraries in the st century are moving toward being spaces with greater interactivity intense collaboration and more fruitful and complex relationships this spirit of welcoming and inclusion that has always been present in libraries is accentuated as the social dynamics of digital transformation we experience in contemporary times takes on new contours and evolves with remote work being more frequent in the lives of several professionals for example network communication requires that more attention be paid to managing emotion and understanding the dimensions of organizational solicitude mutual trust access to help active empathy leniency in judgments and courage von krogh ichijo nonaka both are important in enabling the processes of facilitating knowledge creation and why not also organizational innovation one of the theories that has stood out internationally in contemporary times is the theory of enchantment especially in times of remote work in a recent publication on instagram the national school of public administration enap linked to the ministry of economy of brazil posted on its official profile on august the following question why is it important to create and maintain rituals to generate connections with your co workers in the post enap mentions the american activist and writer chloé simone valdary who applies the enchantment theory in leadership training and in the compassionate fight against racism as stated by enap n p the theory is innovative due to combining social emotional education character development and interpersonal growth as a tool for leadership development in the theory s approach valdary blends elements of pop culture to facilitate the dissemination and understanding of the dimensions and principles of the theory disseminated among students schools companies and governments in several countries including the united states south africa the netherlands germany and israel the theory was presented for the first time to a brazilian audience during a live online broadcast from enap on april chloé valdary spoke with diogo costa the president of enap and highlighted the importance of applying the three fundamental principles of the theory in the development of human beings namely treat people as human beings and not as political distractions when criticizing elevate and empower never with the intent to tear down or destroy doing everything with love an d compassion love in the sense of the greek term agape not based on conditions enap n p in this discussion we highlight innovation in the context of public organizations and realize the relevance of leadership social emotional education and the theory of enchantment we also discuss the interdisciplinary convergence between administration and information science and as a result it is possible to transpose from the literature on family rituals in the context of psychology the conceptual distinction between ritual and routine to the organizational core taking as a basis the question raised by enap why is it important to create and maintain rituals to generate connections with your co workers when proposing to think about enchantment in times of remote work we sought in azevedo s p rdbci campinas sp v e explanation under the perspective coined by fiese et al the difference between routine and ritual detailed in three dimensions namely communication investment and continuity regarding routines the first dimension refers to the instrumental act this is what needs to be done the second dimension refers to the temporary character and little consistency after the routine is performed the third dimension tells us that it is directly observable and detectable by outsiders and the behavior repeats itself over time in contrast to rituals the first dimension refers to the symbolic act this is who we are the second dimension tells us that rituals are enduring and affective and the experience can be repeated in memory the third dimension refers to the extension of meaning across generations and this is interpreted by insiders azevedo p transposing such knowledge to the organizational environment we can understand that routines organize work processes and their repetition over time can transform them into rituals through anticipation and emotional investment however a ritual can become routine if it starts to be felt as an obligation we can consider that routines and rituals enable organizations to deal with the adversities that emerge from their performance whether public or private we can also consider that we cannot dissociate the study and research on innovation and remote work from socioemotional issues involving people of different generations especially in the context of public educational libraries this inseparability is even more evident since it is a space where these several generations meet and seek to meet information needs and other types of needs ranging from children s entertainment to being a support point for teenagers after school for refugee immigrants seeking information to achieve their citizenship among others so far our reflective path has allowed us to realize that starting to think about innovation through remote work inserting public educational libraries constitutes a broad debate with several challenges besides t he above it is also necessary to think about information policies in libraries and the need for social and emotional education of young people and adults it is not possible to think about innovation in this context without trying to understand the issues that make sense for new generations such as the y z and alpha generations which are the most challenging audience for libraries at the moment how to apply efficient library management to promote the development of the generations this is one of the implications of the debate which leads us to start thinking about generations management developing information actions that leverage the best of each one of them can be a starting point of a work and research agenda for research librarians in the context of the federal institutes public educational libraries have the commitment to attend and satisfy through their products and services the employed generations the unemployed ones and those who are in the process of training to access the world of work and employment very soon the challenge is even greater in this context thinking about the innovative contribution of the public educational library to the issue of remote work therefore will require thinking that its strategic management may include everything from the analysis of reports to the evaluation of quantitative and qualitative indicators on the diversity of generations it is necessary to think what can enable more assertive actions such as the development of incentive programs for productivity the promotion of greater involvement of social actors in decision making processes greater digital presence and engagement of young people and adults and other actions even motivational ones also focusing on the management of emotions in the workplace a subject that has received more notoriety and relevance nowadays the pandemic and post pandemic context worldwide has inspired us to be creative innovative and adaptive we have learned by necessity at the time of the pandemic and are applying to the new moment to work well remotely moving towards hybrid models remote rdbci campinas sp v e and face to face activities more flexible and adaptable to networked social dynamics we are facing crises and opportunities a promising service is in demand and public educational libraries are at the center of the problem and the solution from it solutions may emerge that contribute to innovation through remote work if possible adding the importance of the three dimensions communication investment and continuity defended by the enchantment theory along with its three principles which collaborate in facing and breaking paradigms that interfere with productivity and organizational culture in the public sector a promising service performed by brazilian public educational libraries importantly innovation in information services is central to the evolution of libraries public educational libraries have evolved to become remote workspaces with the purpose of serving communities of professionals who work and communicate online is the creation of remote workspaces or zones in educational libraries a really promising and viable initiative perhaps the answer to this question is only possible with the implementation of public policies that guarantee the promotion and therefore the adequate investment in infrastructure and beyond experimentation may be the best alternative for these libraries to become citizen laboratories and effectively fulfill their educational function with innovative services based on the idea of learning libraries guided by the five disciplines of peter senge personal mastery mental models team learning shared vision and systemic thinking other questions emerge from this conjuncture namely how to define the diversity of remote working professionals who would seek the library as a remote workspace possibly the implementation and management of distributed citizen labs can contribute to this knowledge of the public and their needs it is action and reflection in action that will guide the evaluation and innovation agenda that is sought in remote work and libraries the very social mission of the federal institutes in the context of professional and technological education in brazil with emphasis on the importance of offering remote work support service in public educational libraries justifies the investments in this segment of professional performance of librarians what can we reflect on in this section to start thinking about the construction of a work and research agenda the search for ways to contribute to the success of digital transformation in the world of work which encompasses greater public investment in libraries is challenging digital transformation is a process not an arrival point or a destination in order to contribute to the formation and development of a research agenda on innovation in the scientific field of information science and in the professional field of federal institutes in brazil it is necessary to bring together researchers especially research librarians linked to these institutions working in the country gabriel junior sousa and silva in their mapping of the scientific literature on the most productive authors in the subject of innovation indexed in brapci in the period to identified that the only researcher linked to a federal institute is the librarian and phd in information science valmira perucchi from the federal institute of paraíba fipb from this study it is observed a change in this scenario with the beginning of a research agenda that can fill this gap and overcome the incipient scientific production on the theme from a series of publications according to this article that is also the result of a doctoral research regarding the work agenda the function of the public educational libraries is to contribute to the federal institutes in their mission to promote teaching research and extension through professional scientific and technological education with the union of information rdbci campinas sp v e education and technology to ensure sustainable local regional and national development even in the face of the context in which we find ourselves in which it is a challenge to build online the relations and structures of an educational institution as in the case of the federal institutes and their public educational libraries according to paula silva and woida p libraries are the basis of education serving as a support for teaching research and extension and for this reason they are reinventing themselves in the current scenario by offering services and informational products such as book loans in delivery training workshops lives of information competence on how to use information sources safely for research standardization of academic papers scientific writing among others with the need for the services provided by public educational libraries having to adapt during the pandemic to the social isolation and distance the professionals who work in them had to adapt to a new reality the remote work thus they have had to review their services and actions to continue with the importance they have always had in the educational context while still meeting the information needs of their users in a satisfactory manner as quickly efficiently and effectively as possible as is customary trends are becoming reality in our day to day lives it must also be understood that they have had to reinvent themselves in offering and making online information products and services accessible and easy to handle for users the user experience is central to this way of life to work with the emerging reality public educational libraries have expanded the use of services offered on social networks such as instagram twitter and facebook as well as service channels using whatsapp and electronic forms and have made available and assisted in the use of open access databases that enable users to access e books and scientific articles in this way the libraries have been engaged in improving their information services and products by making information available through websites social media and networks such as instagram twitter facebook and other media these communication means are great disseminates of information and where several subjects are connected daily causing information to circulate at greater speed because these informational channels allow librarians and users not only to seek interaction but also to make information sharing paula silva woida p the pandemic required the process of joining technology and education forcing us to use in a systematic and general way digital media for sharing information providing services and other activities it is necessary to think and plan for this post pandemic context with the offer and creation of innovative spaces with services that ensure the safety and health of everyone involved in the libraries this process can be guided by an agenda oriented to social development as the digital transformation guides contemporary life in all processes and information flows agenda for social development and digital transformation drawing up a work agenda in parallel to drawing up a research agenda is not only possible but necessary these days there is a clear inextricability between the work agenda and the research agenda as much as there is for social development and digital transformation from this century onwards in an experimental way in this section we will address a proposal for a work agenda that can be applied in public educational libraries through a research agenda that is being constituted in the scope of the research group on project management in education science rdbci campinas sp v e information and technology projecit linked to the ifpb campus joão pessoa and registered with the national council for scientific and technological development cnpq since some questions can be applied via e mail to the librarians responsible for the libraries in the system to have a local sample of the perception of these managers on this subject and later expanded for comparative studies this is a proposal for application in future studies there was no need to apply a questionnaire at this point in the research because we are in a stage of reflection these questions could be developed based on a small group of guiding questions namely a during the pandemic what did you do differently in your remote activities that you did not do before the pandemic and that may have generated innovation b in the library is innovation through remote work possible c traditionally the library is a study and research space for students do you think the library can become a remote workspace for professionals what conditions would you need to make this service viable ruiz p our translation states that all living beings share vulnerability not as weakness but as that which in needing each other allows us to link ally and support each other the researcher points out that this vulnerability became much more evident with the social and health crisis stemming from the covid pandemic as argued by ruiz we have the potential to create collaborative networks in research and the workplace but we need the resources and proper infrastructure to do so these resources and the necessary infrastructure can be obtained by formulating activity specific public policies in the public sector however it is first necessary to spread among librarians researchers public managers and other professionals relevant to the issue in public organizations the potential of the public educational library in order to generate innovation from remote wor k in this sense it is necessary to develop a research agenda that supports a work agenda so that information policies are assertively developed resources are allocated and the promotion is effectively carried out in these public sector environments that lack innovation chart first topics on the research agenda topic description organizational identity of libraries in federal institutes innovation remote working and infrastructure of educational libraries digital transformation and innovation in information services through projects learning and practice communities in libraries and research groups users need and experience in virtual learning networks social media marketing strategies for educational libraries public policies to combat intergenerational information poverty source authors the seven themes pointed out above do not exhaust or limit the research agenda that is being constituted they are the starting point for a research work based on the science action method in the context of information science constituting an unprecedented proposal for intervention in the scientific field bringing theoretical contributions to a scientific field that is increasingly aligned and closer to the practices of information professionals and the needs of current and future generations of information users and producers in a networked society rdbci campinas sp v e final considerations the results highlight the possibility of innovation through remote work in the federal public service we are facing an opportunity to innovate in the public sector with a promising service that can be performed by public educational libraries in federal institutes in brazil the appropriate infrastructure for remote workspaces we also observed an inseparability between the work agenda and the research agenda as well as between social development and digital transformation from this century on as far as these educational libraries are concerned the study aims to contribute to the development of more assertive public policies for this type of library its public and its new work dynamics that are being constituted it is possible that solutions to real problems faced in the daily life of information professionals will be proposed based on the research agenda that is being developed at the inter institutional level the fruitful path that science action has been building in information science in brazil with studies that bring together the theories in use in the professional context with the theories proclaimed by the scientific field shows the possibilities of innovation that are to come the alignment of studies on educational library infrastructure with the development of smart cities in the context of creative economy entrepreneurship and digital transformation will reveal new possibilities and solutions in the core of the field of information science to meet the emerging demands of the network society it is therefore a promising theme for us to start thinking about the construction of a brazilian digital agenda based on the contributions of this scientific field we conclude that the paths to digital transformation in the world of work can become even more productive innovative profitable and sustainable when we seek continuous and adequate investment in infrastructure and innovation of libraries that fulfill an educational function and are of a public nature following the high level of social relevance of the federal institutes in the context of inclusion through professional scientific and technological education in brazil it is necessary still continuous investment in the formulation of public policies especially information policies to ensure the role of the librarian as an agent of innovation in federal institutes as the next step of the authors of this research considered as a fruit of the research a scientific article will be communicated on how the information policy correlates with the innovation policy in federal institutes covering in its discussion the theoretical pragmatic model for the development of information policies of brandão and the challenges arising from the post pandemic scenario from the digital agenda elac and the recent actions occurred in brazil that favor the development of the
