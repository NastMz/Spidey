the ocasion the academiaia platform was shared which includes learning resources as wel as information about events and tols always related to the use of artificial inteligence conect ia is the name of the new colaborative aliance developed by the catholic university and microsoft as its moto indicates the purpose of this initiative is to promote artificial inteligence in chile and also in latin america in presentation held in the uc hal of honor the progres of this joint work was shared with the university comunity and academiaia was presented fre platform for those who study teach and work at this higher education institution and which includes resources and tols for the use of artificial inteligence ai artificial inteligence is one of the most transformative technologies of our time it has the potential to improve people quality of life generate new knowledge and solutions to the most complex problems of our society and create new oportunities for economic and social development said uc rector ignacio sánchez the university authority valued the strategic aliance that has ben articulated with microsoft world leading company in technological development and emphasized that as university comited to our society and academic excelence the catholic university canot be left out of this technological revolution but it must be leading actor and regional reference in the development and research of artificial inteligence as wel as in its responsible aplication to the various areas of our university mision the uc development plan has digital transformation among its main axes it is proces that seks to enable people to interact directly with technology and data and also adopt culture that takes advantage of the benefits of this transformation one of the chalenges is also to increasingly integrate these technologies in teaching practices in research and also in organizational management as university comited to our society and academic excelence the catholic university canot be left out of this technological revolution but must be leading actor and regional reference in the development and research of artificial inteligence ignacio sánchez rector of the uc the prorector of the uc guilermo marshal who has ben one of the main promoters of the conectia project maintained that the efects of this initiative can also be very significant in the educational field this aliance alows us to be protagonists and leader it is technological revolution whose scope is dificult to measure today it is very likely that this wil imply in the very near future reviewing the academic programs the teaching learning proceses and the forms of evaluation for our students he stated this aliance alows us to be protagonists and leaders of technological revolution whose scope they are today dificult to size it is very likely that this wil imply in the very near future reviewing the academic programs the teaching learning proceses and the forms of evaluation for our students guilermo marshal uc pro rector incorporating ai in education entities bruce thompson director of microsoft education for the americas and an expert in technological maters spoke about how higher education institutions today can eficiently take advantage of artificial inteligence sharing diferent international examples and initiatives artificial inteligence is going to change the way students receive information which has an impact on the curiculum and instructional design he stated he highlighted that in order to get the maximum potential out of ai it is important to unite the institutional strategy with the technological one which requires overcoming diferent chalenges and also incorporating cultural changes prone to the adoption of these technologies in this sense the manager explained that it is esential to define specific objectives in the incorporation of artificial inteligence as wel as goals at the level of academic units and central entities of the university administration artificial inteligence is going to change the way students receive information which has an impact on the curiculum and instructional design bruce thompson director of education microsoft for the americas for the incorporation of ai within the university thompson maintained that it is relevant to provide guidelines and aids to facilitate learning for example teaching how to ask precise questions to artificial inteligence tols so that they provide corect answers on the other hand he emphasized hackathons as another way to promote the introduction of ai in which students with programing knowledge manage to create solutions for certain chalenges that are proposed to them the manager stated that the uc through its leadership can also become reference for both chile and the region on these isues to the extent that it sucesfuly incorporates these technologies the microsoft expert shared diferent examples of how schol entities and universities in the united states had managed to reduce the workload through the use of ai the new york city schol system which has milion students developed tutor bot to asist them in the case of the university ad from michigan academics and researchers are suported by bots that help them cary out their research work more quickly and eficiently meanwhile seneca university in canada has developed service to find work based on ai providing students with the posibility of training and carying out simulations of job interviews for certain companies it is important to develop skils and above al for university students and academics to learn about ai said bruce thompson aliance progres the first step of conectia was taken at the end of last year when the catholic university signed an agrement with microsoft one of the main technology multinationals in the world the purpose of the colaboration agrement signed is to build and lead cuting edge horizon in terms of digital transformation through the integration of artificial inteligence with the purpose of generating impact both in the university own work as wel as in chile and the region as explained by maría francisca yáñez director of the microsoft national technology ofice the aliance is not only focused on technology and ai but also on academic chalenges research and educational experiences based precisely on the uc own chalenges initiatives were defined to work on over the next five years one of the great deficiencies that companies and institutions curently have in adopting technologies such as those related to ai is the fact that they lack trained teams therefore the role of the university in moving the frontier of knowledge and training students and work teams is key said maría francisca yáñez conectia considers comon objectives betwen the uc and microsoft around understanding that digital transformation and the implementation of technologies such as ai must ocur in stages in which artificial inteligence constitutes key axis and where the university mision and vision one of the great deficiencies that companies and institutions curently have in adopting technologies such as those related to ai is the fact that they lack trained teams therefore the role of the university in moving the frontier of knowledge and training students and work teams is key maría francisca yáñez director of the microsoft national technology ofice mauricio bernabó director of uc digital transformation anounced some of the initiatives that are being promoted in this phase of the aliance this is how chatbot is being developed within the uc program that uses artificial inteligence to understand questions and answer them similar to human conversation we are working to take advantage of al the information that the university has rsity to be able to ask the chatbot questions and have very quick answers we hope to include al the regulations data related to academic units carers and other types of information which wil be very useful for al people who wil be able to aces it from various devices explained bernabó we are doing various tests of how through al the university data which is on the internet various analyzes can be done very quickly by degre and faculties mauricio bernabó director of digital transformation uc copilot artificial inteligence developed by microsoft is another of the tols that are already being used at the university and when conected to the internet it alows you to always have updated information among its various functions it is used to search for data sumarize conversations and request the creation of mesages content image design similar to other platforms such as chatgpt third initiative consists of taking advantage of al the information available to the university through ai with reporting systems we are doing various tests of how through al the university data which is on the internet various analyzes by major and faculties can be done very quickly said the director of digital transformation and aded that al members of the university comunity is invited to be active protagonists of this aliance under the aproach that people are at the center of institutions and change proceses it was determined that it is important to provide them with aces to the multiple tols that exist to learn about artificial inteligence this is precisely why the academiaia platform was developed to which members of the university comunity can aces courses generated by microsoft for fre curently there are resources available among which there are courses for beginers people with intermediate and also advanced knowledge on basic concepts of ai content related to the adoption of responsible ai practices and principles training of learning models dep in software among others acording to francisco quiroga deputy director of institutional technologies at the uc among the proposed goals is guaranteing aces to formal learning resources on artificial inteligence creating events and colaborative spaces that promote the exchange of ideas and experiences about ai and providing tols that facilitate the adoption of ai based technologies in daily activities academiaia is aimed at the academic body students and the university profesional and administrative team various events wil also be organized asociated with this platform the closest wil be the talk on how to create with had with generative ai that wil be given on may at by sylvie duchamp director of external comunications at microsoft for south america on the other hand course and certification on the fundamentals of azure ai another platform that the microsoft company has was also recently launched these are eight projects already enabled in their first phase to cover four key areas environment mobility security and enabling resources to cary out technological transformations within the san joaquín campus the idea is that they wil then be replicated by diferent municipalities to move towards smart santiago and improve the quality of life of its inhabitants what is meant by smart city the inter american development bank describes it as teritorial space that puts people at the center of development that incorporates technologies in urban management and that uses these elements to stimulate the formation of an eficient government which makes cities more spaces resilient and eficient under this premise betwen and the first smart city on national scale has ben created at the uc san joaquín campus this thanks to an initiative led by an aliance betwen lab claro uc inovation center and sé santiago strategic program of corfo metropolitano and fundación país digital the project seks to implement technological solutions enabled with with the aim of improving people wel being the idea is to test diferent technologies so that they can later be replicated by municipalities the implementation work has already begun with eight technologies deployed on campus in areas such as environment mobility security and enabling resources to generate technological changes among others since work began on the smart city at scale it was known that it was chalenging project but despite its complexity as francisco pizaro deputy director of the area with industry at the uc anacleto angelini inovation center explains we had thre fundamental items to put it into practice demonstration space in which regional governments could se how to use these technologies space to prototype and generate solutions from academia and meting place to work with entrepreneurs on open inovation models that is why not only the san joaquín campus its profesionals and the portfolio of entrepreneurs were made available but also the ability to cordinate the chalenge of delivering impact solutions that improve the quality of life of the inhabitants something that is the objective of smart cities says the profesional this project also contemplates the deployment of infrastructure that combines technologies such as fiber optics stand alone or independent and iot internet of things al of them key elements to migrate from traditional management to the smart city finaly it also has the suport of the companies nokia and qualcom border initiative acording to the rector ignacio sánchez the initiative responds to the curent and future chalenges that the development of urban centers and the

students academics program heads management teams and authorities can enter to learn saga in this link and take advantage of its benefits in the development of the doctoral thesis framed in the digital transformation proces the integrated continuing education management system sigec consolidates the regional leadership of the university which in had more than thousand enroled students an important milestone was achieved few days ago by the integrated continuing education management system sigec that the catholic university is promoting the incorporation of new digital module for the comercial and financial management of the diplomas and courses of al the faculties of the university institution those who study at uc wil now be able to expeditiously aces their courses emails certifications evaluations payment and enrolment proceses so their training experience wil benefit this is an initiative framed in the digital transformation proces of the uc which is led by the pro rector ofice for institutional management the directorate of continuing education in colaboration with faculties teachers and other units such as the directorate of information technology directorate of digital transformation and digital management sigec is large ecosystem of digital platforms that are automaticaly integrated for the entire management of continuing education which involves the entire life proces of the student from the disemination of the programs aplication and enrolment academic management proceses financial the delivery of courses on virtual platforms certification among others explains luz montero director of continuing education sigec is large ecosystem of digital platforms that are automaticaly integrated for the entire management of continuing education which involves the entire life proces of the student luz montero director of continuing education the initiative that began to be devised in under the push from the authorities of that time such as paulina gómez former vice rector of comunications and margarita guarelo former director of continuing education wil mean that the service wil be totaly digital and fast which wil help not only improve its quality but that also to internationalize the academic ofering of the uc curently more than of the courses ofered are online which is why it is increasingly relevant for systems and proceses to be digital during phase of the project had ben launched with the implementation of an electronic certification system with an advanced digital signature the second stage recently completed includes in adition to the busines administration module also an updated website and new registration and registration portals which wil be integrated with salesforce world clas software for busines management through highly integrated and digital system the platform alows us to enhance key and strategic aspects of continuing education such as perfecting and increasing the academic ofering enhancing the

infrastructure technologies and investments to strengthen it and project it in the long term patricio donoso pro rector of institutional management points out that the implementation of sigec seks to achieve more dynamic clear and timely experience for students who are the main focus of this digital transformation he ads that for this we must acelerate cultural change to which we are al caled to get involved and adapt thus strengthening our own work capabilities we must acelerate cultural change to which we are al caled to get involved and adapt thus strengthening our own work capabilities patricio donoso pro rector of institutional management these changes are framed in the context of great growth that continuing education has experienced in the uc during more than students enroled many of whom also come from various regions of chile and other places in the world the increase is relevant if you consider that in there were just over thousand students the transformation is stil underway since the implementation of phase of sigec both the teams that have directly participated in the operation of these new systems and the academic units of the university have strengthened their colaboration to comply with the new management standards we are very hapy to have achieved this achievement after years of hard work we know that we must continue working intensely in this period of stabilization of the systems with view to the next implementation of the academic module says the director of continuing education luz montero she emphasizes that the transformation of continuing education does not end with this project we ned convening aligned work with vision for the future by al these elements being integrated they suport each other it wil alow us to respond more eficiently to the neds of the students paulina rodríguez director of the sigec project what are the next steps the director of the project paulina rodríguez explains that during the wil be the turn of the implementation of the academic module which wil incorporate baner an academic records software and the modle platform as learning management system into the ecosystem as al these elements are integrated they suport each other wil alow us to respond with greater eficiency to the neds of the students comite of experts from the public private and academic world wil develop the cybersecurity roadmap concrete plan led by the uc inovation center and microsoft to strengthen chile digital security within thre years cybercrime is problem that afects various sectors of society this is evidenced in the study impact of covid on the culture and operation of chilean smes by microsoft chile which showed that out of companies declared that the pandemic acelerated the digital transformation of their busines through technological adoption indicating that of them invested to facilitate teleworking however acording to forbes magazine smal busineses were thre times more susceptible than larger companies to cybercriminal atacks such as hacking cyber threats and phishing among others cybersecurity is transversal and progresive ned due to the exponential increase in crimes linked to cybercrime and the high rate of atempted cyberatacks on public private entities and above al civil society acording to data provided by microsoft cyber signals study in december alone milion cyber atacks were recorded globaly while more than bilion threats were reported by busines and consumer devices blocking more than bilion malicious email acounts aimed at clients and consumers digital security is also an urgent ned in the country hence the cybersecurity roadmap was born an initiative led by the uc anacleto angelini inovation center and microsoft chile and which was born from previous plan the digital transformation roadmap for economic reactivation the objective is to develop concrete action plan to be executed in the next thre years the initiative which brings together experts from the public private and academic world from various areas and industries seks to contribute to the diagnosis and impact the development of proposals that alow chile to adres the imense cybersecurity gaps we face exposed for pedro bouchon vice rector of uc research and president of the board of directors of the uc inovation center this roadmap arises in the context of the ned to acelerate digital transformation in the country to help economic reactivation this transformation however canot be caried out in an unprotected maner given that digitalization opens important spaces of vulnerability on which critical prevention mitigation and cyber resilience capabilities must be built in the ecosystem he says and he ads the sped of cybersecurity atacks and the constant evolution and sophistication of cybercrime makes it necesary to develop university industry state colaboration models that are capable of pushing frontier research and facilitate technological and knowledge transfer in an agile way this is where the roadmap plays fundamental role in facilitating the development of spaces for experimentation and asociative profs of concept which alow for cybersecurity laboratories for the development of advanced research and the training of skils and talent new competencies to confront cyberatacks critical axis for the development of roadmap is the development of talent and competencies says mario ponce dean of the faculty of mathematics member of the advisory comite and the talent development comite of the cybersecurity roadmap along these lines significant gaps are projected in the specialized talent necesary to face the cybersecurity chalenges of the coming years which means chalenge not only in organizations that demand this type of profiles and that must generate new models for atracting and retaining employes talent but also as dean ponce says for us as university regarding how we generate new training models that adapt to these demands for talent acording to the dean our chalenges are around what new profiles competencies methodologies and modalities we ned to create and ofer considering these chalenges in transversal maner both for undergraduate and graduate students as continuing education for profesionals and even work at the schol level and he ads that we have adresed some of these lines through the creation of new degres and new continuing education programs and at the schol level through the mathematics olympiads which are projected as space for detecting important talent however there are stil oportunities to develop training models together with the industry and with greater agility to respond to the demands of the ecosystem work methodology in these almost thre months of work together with the advisory comite we already developed the first stage that coresponded to shared diagnosis of gaps and oportunities in cybersecurity in this proces it was very relevant to understand what comparative experiences exist and what initiatives are being executed in the local and regional ecosystem explains rocío ortiz cordinator in the area of digital transformation and cybersecurity of the uc inovation center on this shared diagnosis prioritization was caried out and thre strategic areas were selected that gave rise to the development comites explains the person responsible for the work methodology of the roadmap for cybersecurity the advisory comite is led by maría francisca yáñez director of inovation and technology at microsoft chile and ramón molina executive director of the uc inovation center as chair or director and co chair or co director respectively amente in adition to an outstanding group of leaders and experts from various areas who wil be in charge of preparing work proposals from the diferent development comites technological talent and cybersecurity culture the work wil culminate with the publication of document in the public domain that wil sek to generate contribution and social impact the chalenges of the cybersecurity roadmap the next chalenges wil be to build the portfolios of projects that ned to be executed over the next thre years in order to achieve the future vision that we expect around cybersecurity for chile defining tactical and asociative line of work to execute it says rocío ortiz as ramón molina says one of the first conclusions reached in this first stage after the survey is that there is already strategic diagnosis asociated with what the cybersecurity gaps and oportunities are for chile as wel as indicators of our national level of maturity on this isue therefore the role of this roadmap is to cary out tactical and concrete lowering of the action plan that our country neds to reach the desired level of maturity in this line inovation is the fundamental basis to be able to develop colaborative and optimal work models to move with the level of agility that we ned ads molina the thre development comites that have already started their work after the strategic prioritization implemented are talent and development of skils in cybersecurity culture in cybersecurity and technology ecosystems protocols and standards for cybersecurity these tables bring together more than experts technicians and specialists from various areas and industries who wil be working over the next two months once the portfolio of projects proposed by these comites has ben consolidated the advisory council wil review and evaluate them to define which measures wil be finaly considered in the oficial cybersecurity roadmap document the result of

strategic misions and loks back on the lesons learned during the pandemic which has increased the use of digital tols in education as in other sectors matias mano the main mision of the center for teaching inovation is to suport psl profesors and education oficers in their educational transformation projects the goal is to enhance and diversify educational practices in order to promote the suces of al students to achieve this goal we ofer two types of services the first is focused on suporting faculty members our center is at their service asistance from the center for teaching inovation involves suporting profesors in their reflection on how to continuously improve their teaching the center educational enginers with their diverse experience and scientific oversight are able to understand and sugest solutions to teaching problems that profesors may encounter the second is focused on training faculty members through the in house psl schol we ofer great number of training programs to raise their understanding of the changes curently taking place in education this is given particular focus during the welcome wek for new profesors perfect time to promote the center or during pédagodays two days of per to per exchanges to reflect on one own teaching practices the main chalenge ahead of us is raising the profile of the center and its services we ned to reach out to al psl schols the aim is to understand the specific characteristics of their teaching to compile their neds in relation to the center services and of course to met them this wil be achieved by building comunity of practice for psl faculty members far from replacing the role of the teacher technology is suplementary tol that can compensate for potential shortcomings especialy in times of crisis matias mano the health crisis we have gone through has put students most of al in situation of great dificulty to many of them have become very isolated profesors have also shown an unprecedented degre of resilience in ensuring the infamous instructional continuity this continuity was made posible largely thanks to digital tols with videoconferencing in the main however for many profesors this forced experimentation with remote learning was very negative would like to highlight the strength and courage of the administrative staf especialy in the information systems department and in our center who made it posible to maintain teaching during an emergency situation as the crisis nears its end which we al hope wil be for god services like the center for teaching inovation canot ignore the fact that many profesors may harbor desire to do things as befor the pandemic overal the pandemic has advanced us by several years in terms of our understanding of digital tols its impact is powerful reminder that far from replacing the role of the teacher technology is suplementary tol that can compensate for potential shortcomings especialy in times of crisis the center for teaching inovation aims to synthesize this wealth of experience our goal is to perpetuate the best practices that have emerged from the crisis and to extend their use inovation pédagogique enseignement en situation urgence en france july by perine de coëtlogon matias mano bertrand mocquet matias mano digital technology is just tol we wil never push the use of tol for the sake of it when teacher asks us to implement particular modle activity or particular woclap activity we sek first and foremost to met an educational ned for example using woclap facilitates the interaction betwen students and the profesor in an auditorium this tol makes it posible to pause lecture and ask the students questions to ensure that they can folow what they are being taught similarly almost al clases rely on the use of educational resources the modle learning platform is used to centralize and clasify these resources profesors have the option to upload al of them when they build their course and to make them available to students as they go along this reduces the administrative load of course and facilitates the learning proces in short once educational neds have ben identified the center helps the teacher find the best way to met them very often the digital tols at our disposal make it easier to ofer solution matias mano the simplest way to find out more about our activities and to get in touch is to visit our website there you wil find interviews with profesors useful information calendar of the training courses we ofer at the psl schol and most importantly how to contact us for suport request the pédagodays psl which wil be held on june and registration via the psl schol are also great way to find out more about us on these days we wil be ofering workshops and discusions

entrepreneurship at université psl bruno rostand it is inded partnership of new type but at psl we are used to creating bridges betwen disciplines and players we were contacted by the web schol factory to develop joint response to the pia disrupt campus cal for proposals and saw this as an oportunity to further diversify our aproaches and discover new perspectives particularly in the areas of inovation and digital transformation which are priorities for us ane lalou by co creating this curiculum we wanted and this is very new to get involved in seting up companies and open them to new inovative ecosystems to met this chalenge the campus of formation etudiants entreprises is based on thre pilars while taking into acount the new skils neded in today digital world we wanted to not only implement colaborations betwen students and employes but also create new project based training program cfe wil develop the creativity entrepreneurship and inovation capabilities of our students ane lalou in companies inovation is being done more and more by intrapreneurial aproaches in practice this means that an sme or large group gives some of its employes the time and suport necesary for the development of project that could potentialy turn into profitable busines intrapreneurship ofers companies the oportunity to think outside the box and open up to the vitality of the entrepreneurial ecosystem digital transformation and inovation wil increasingly go through this type of aproach and we wanted to suport the framework of cfe by providing students and employes with the necesary tols bruno rostand similar to our entrepreneurship trainings iti psl pépite cfe wil develop the creativity entrepreneurship and inovation capacities of our students but intrapreneurship starts with concrete chalenge to answer the neds of partner company and this brings new dimension an imersion in the life of the company and an experience of the digital transition which hapens there in this regard cfe completes and enriches our training ofer and moreover some of the activities of cfe wil take place at the psl lab coworking space of the psl pépite entrepreneurship group ane lalou there wil be many of them the impact of the cfe student training wil be in my opinion quite imediate the web schol factory already exists student projects give fresh lok at the teams of partner companies it is fruitful interaction that moves lines and opens aditional interesting perspectives the students of the cfe wil be able to profit from it this new curiculum is also in our opinion an investment of the future it wil complement the training of shs students or psl enginering students by providing them with expertise and experience in digital transformation besides the mixing of social origins internationalization or parity intergenerational is esential cfe wil be an example bruno rostand students have lot to learn from employes about the reality of market and busines experiences in return they bring fresh lok to which the rigor and the level of requirement of their training match employes wil leave their comfort zone put aside their certainties to bring out inovative and transformative concepts for their company ane lalou we bet that this intergenerational colaboration wil be stimulating constructive and above al that it wil serve as founding experience for their lifelong training to learn in initial training in continuing education online or even in groups these formats wil disapear and it is great oportunity for the players to experience it at this stage we talk lot about diversity in today world besides the mixing of social origins internationalization or parity intergenerational diversity is esential cfe wil be an example start ups hope wil

employes of our busines partners come share your experiences and ambitions with our students in order to co create the solutions of tomorow the digital transformation is ushering in host of new busines practices in september to help today managers decision makers entrepreneurs and employes draw on those latest practices to enhance their capacity for inovation creativity and autonomy psl and the web schol factory introduced the new cfe program campus formation etudiants entreprises month interdisciplinary course in intrapreneurship we talked to the program instructional and project directors about this unusual new course ofering françois pumir half of this year cfe clas are students from psl and the web schol factory while the other half are profesionals from our partner busineses the primary benefit of this training is that it gives the participants new perspective and set of methodologies for managing the digital transformation which is exactly what those participants have ben hoping to find one of the esential ways we re efecting the digital transformation is by puting people at the heart of every project we encourage our students to adopt user centric aproach and to tackle every isue in terms of what desirable rather than the more restrictive mindset stil so comon in the busines world of what feasible at this stage everyone stil very motivated although the change in viewpoint has ben litle disconcerting for some in the group thibaut barbarin the students and profesionals in our clas come from wide aray of backgrounds they re enginers atorneys managers and so on and within their work groups they may each take similar aproach or they may clash that proven very fertile we can already se that the learning proces wil be much faster than in other programs launch of course dedicated to intrapreneurship and digital transformation right at the start of the semester we held the cfe hack to serve as real world exercise the clas had six days to come up with new busines models for some very established industries it dificult test regardles of your age or experience because you can simply fal back on an automatic response the goal of the exercise is to give students the ability to sit down in front corporate board or group of lenders and ofer vision of given topic that not just busines minded but user centric concrete and objective the instructional team profesors our partner busines leaders etc helped guide them through that first experience it shift in perspective that can be disconcerting but it necesary in order to embrace the radicaly new vision of what the digital transformation can be the cfe hack was realy enlightening experience for everyone in the clas about the ned to learn more ever since they ve ben much more aware of the learning curve they re investing the time and they re using that learning time more efectively that was also very god learning experience for handling data the digital transforma tion involves masive amounts of data and in my view it prety critical for every profesional to get up to sped on those isues project based instruction has ben around since wel before the cfe but we re changing the format and especialy the objective because our instructional aproach involves lecturers entrepreneurs profesors experts students busineses and their employes al at once the digital transformation projects we re tackling aren just fictional case studies that ilustrate some pedagogical point they re actual company projects whose progres and results are discused by each company executive comite so there are serious isues at stake the goal and the ambition we ve set is to create spin ofs or busines units and employes are at the heart of that proces of learning how to generate value when project based instruction is used in conventional academic curicula it often uses the pedagogical objective as the starting point and the case studies they use may be real but decades old with the cfe we ve chosen to take diferent aproach we start with what the company hopes to achieve and we join forces to provide the deliverables very close relationship as we said before the cfe program is distinctive in that its work groups include students practitioners educators there no disinterested suport everyone has stake in the project suces that aproach aplies to the relationship with each company as wel companies get an update on their project progres every two weks and it not uncomon for the cfe teams to met with the company executives and high level managers over lunch to work on their projects for me it someone who has real desire to be an entrepreneur and the necesary determination to eliminate obstacles and find solutions someone who loking for something diferent whether they like more meaningful experience like so many people these days or they re simply interested in creating start up it that sense of change that realy important my feling is that management is becoming more horizontal these days and an entrepreneurial mindset wil be key aset again it not typical learning experience and above al we re loking for people who can al be part of single team the oral interview wil play much biger role in whether you re acepted than your cv or cover leter they be people who can strike the right balance within their organizations whether they re entrepreneurs intrapreneurs or something else the important thing is that they know how to make comitment and prosper fulfiling individual carer goals is not what the cfe program is about they be able to take responsibility for the decisions they make and influence the people around them to help bring about change this training realy promises an exciting personal adventure fruit de la

have acelerated the ned for eficient technology from scheduling doctor visits to ordering takeout delivery digital tols have weaved their way into every area of our lives therefore busineses ned to be ready and wiling to adopt these new technologies to met consumer demand but digital first mindset alone isn enough to power sucesful digital transformation you also ned to become digitaly literate your busines must be adopting new technology and ensuring that they are being used as eficiently as posible therefore the second driving factor of implementing digital transformation strategy is enforcing efective onboarding and training sesions to create digitaly literate team finaly the third driving force of digital transformation is continuous evolvement through consistent research and data colectio busineses can use valuable insights to identify and drive enhancements these enhancements may be internal such as refining repetitive tasks that put aditional stres on team members or

and profesor of management science enginering at stanford and co director of the center on work technology and organization she would say that god start understanding the technologies that underpin digital transformation is necesary but not suficient radicaly remaking an organization products services and busines models requires not just understanding technology but also cultural change as dr hinds explains in the webinar most traditional organizations simply canot cope with the pace of inovation hapening now they were built for reliability not for sped growing body of evidence shows organizations that manage to transform themselves also undergo significant cultural change from rot to tip what does that cultural change lok like in the webinar dr hinds outlines five esential shifts organizations must make to suced at digital transformation the first and most esential shift is towards more customer centric culture digital transformation doesn hapen for its own sake it hapens to serve customers beter and drive the busines forward if you don understand your customers unmet neds the other aspects of your digital transformation won be focused on the right goals you can have cuting edge technology and proceses but they won move your busines forward if they don ultimately help you delight your customers once you understand where you re trying to get to with your digital transformation it key to move quickly in that direction but the path of digital transformation is rarely if ever straight line the pace of change requires organizations to pivot regularly you ned to be both fast and nimble that kind of agility often requires rethinking organizational structures traditional hierarchical structures like multi layer decision making and lengthy aproval proceses can get in the way of the ability to take advantage of oportunities rapidly building for the future requires targeted demolition of out dated structures esential checks must of course remain but sucesful digital transformation requires clearing obstacles to quick experimentation and implementation traditionaly when organizations wanted to inovate or update their oferings they would go out and hire someone with the right kind of expertise to drive that change but when it comes to today digital transformation experts don exist change is hapening so fast that even the most qualified and experienced employes must constantly update their knowledge that is why it is so important to build culture of curiosity and voracious learning if an organization is aiming for digital transformation in order to drive new knowledge creation you ned to have people not just wiling to but pasionate about going and learning new things and thinking in new ways dr hinds explains in the webinar the best most ground breaking ideas are often born out of unusual combinations of expertise or technology traditional org charts can silo in knowledge making that kind of fruitful cros polination les likely culture of unbounded colaboration on the other hand alows or even incentivizes employes to work acros traditional boundaries for instance in cros functional groups sometimes it even means working outside of the organization when you ned to aces expertise that doesn exist within the organization itself historicaly this kind of interdisciplinary work was handled asynchronously one team would work on their portion of project before handing it of to another team that iterative proces is just not fast enough anymore for digital transformation to suced culture of unbounded colaboration is esential trying lots of new and out of the box ideas is esential to learn what works and what doesn in the uncertain and fast moving proces of digital transformation but employes are unwiling to try new things if they believe they wil be laughed at or even punished if their ideas fail organizations must explicitly incentivize risk taking and even failure by this hinds doesn mean when we know how to do something right and just get slopy that preventable failure that should be discouraged but organizations should encourage the other kind of failure discused by edmonsdon inteligent failures at the frontier these are failures that provide new knowledge they re learning oportunities for digital transformation to suced an organization culture must embrace this second sort of failure the botom line for dr hinds and for those both leading and participating in digital transformation is that suces is as much about the right culture as it is about the right technology digital transformation requires rethinking organizations cultures structures and systems and the way that people think about their work and work together she believes these changes aren just for industries that we usualy think of as hi tech nor are they just the preserve of top executives even industries that are typicaly thought about as being low tech wil be and are experiencing radical changes dr hinds says recaling recent trip to dairy farm where the cows were milked automaticaly and output was monitored remotely via ipad it important to be ready she concludes digital transformation is pervasive and it is always beter to be in the know and be able to anticipate some of these things so that we can get ahead of the and make contribution for those loking to prepare is available here or learn more about

apointment as president prof dr bundhit has adopted the spedboat strategy and tailored it in such way as to make organization management leaner and swifter why spedboat strategy chula is university under government supervision it is large organization with an old structure and rigid system like big clunky ship with an outdated motor whether operating turning moving forward or halting it takes long time it is not agile nor can it kep up with the changes in the present and future world changes hapen rapidly and there are always new oportunities in store if you kep hanging onto the big ship and heading in one direction you wil not be able to kep up with the game reforming long standing systems and institutional structures is not an easy task since people in the system are used to the old paterns and systems god solution is not to knock down old ones but to create new ones to do new things we have to break up into smaler boats to do new things which requires new people in adition we also ned to set up new working team of agile members with positive atitude who can sek new oportunities in diferent directions and environments to deliver quality work that benefits society explains prof dr bundhit over the past few years many of chula spedboats have pionered new waters and proven the suces of this strategy that has disrupted the society inovation hub ihub for instance which has

knowledge chula students ned to be cultivated for competency to solve complex problems and have god characteristics to manage and live in fast changing tough creative and out of the box world therefore chula direction and the people building proces have changed from the kind of teaching in which stud ents sit and listen to lectures in clas to students and profesors learning together through research and knowledge aplication to solve real world social problems in today world knowledge is acesible without teachers and knowledge is constantly changing we can se that much of the knowledge has become obsolete such as some financial knowledge these days there are blockchains mobile payments qr code payments and so on yet skils and competency in aplying knowledge for useful purposes wil always be with the learners if graduates of chula have the skils and competencies they wil be able to learn on their own exchange knowledge with others create new knowledge and kep on

context and the problems of the society which are always changing up until recently chula has ben teaching university that produces research with the main focus on teaching and research as secondary but with the direction of creating people to build the future chula has transformed itself into research university that teaches which means that the profesors must build upon the available knowledge

their presence in the consumer market as startups producing inovative products when we broke up the big ship into spedboats many people in the big ship were disatisfied couldn se why we had to do it

years this means that chula neds to alter its structure and work to kep up with rapidly changing world prof dr bundhit concluded at the age of having recently graduated from the computer enginering course at the state university of campinas unicamp césar gon opened startup focused on software development with two colege friends bruno guiçardi and fernando mat who continue to run the busines thus in ci was born it was diferent time with the begining of the comercial internet as busines tol in brazil and around the world recals gon now years old the company prospered internationalized and became multinational with ofices in the united states canada united kingdom china and japan more than people work at the company which expects to reach bilion in revenue in and was elected the main gogle partner worldwide from to today ci main ofering is no longer custom made software for corporate clients two years ago we created methodology caled lean digital transformation to help brands born in the th century adapt to the busines environment of our century in this interview given at prisma the name of the building that houses the company in campinas sp gon explains the company new busines proposal and tels the secrets of the trajectory of brazilian startup that transformed into global company what is the lean digital transformation that you ofer to the market the objective of this proposal is to change proceses and the culture of corporate environments of major brands born in the th century so that they have the agility required in the digital era of the st century we want to help corporations on this transformation journey ading value that can impact their busines no company no mater how sucesful it may have ben in the past can do without redesigning itself from the customer perspective it is no surprise that the presidents of the largest companies in the world understand digital transformation as cultural chalenge and not just technological one what is this methodology based on it is based on thre elements change in the way the company designs and builds digital solutions based on the lean philosophy se explanation below transformation of its management system with the adoption of short learning cycles and redesign of the leadership model without fear of making mistakes these thre components make the company digital transformation which wil become faster more inovative and customer focused obviously this aplies to the technology area you can compete in the modern world without software and information being the heart of your busines but we ned to go beyond technology and promote change in culture and way of thinking why is it important for brands to make this transition competition betwen companies in the st century is obsesively focused on the sped with which through data analysis we understand serve and surprise the customer but large corporations are slow by nature and are not prepared for this reality they lok to the side and se an amazon gogle or an aple which were born in the digital environment and are much faster than them with presence in brazil the united states canada the united kingdom china and japan the company expects to reach bilion in revenue in is it not just mater of adapting to new technologies but of establishing new relationship with consumers undoubtedly the way we relate to brands is radicaly diferent from years ago our desire is more volatile we have les atachment to tradition we want to know if that brand solves our problems if it understands us and treats us in unique way the posible way out is to truly conect in this volatility in this uncertainty where did you get inspiration to create this proposal the lean method originates from the word lean in english and emerged in the production lines of the japanese automaker toyota in the it proposed implementing more simplified proces flow aiming to reduce waste of resources materials time labor work etc and increasing aded value for the customer we were inspired by this method to expand customers digital skils in practice how does this transition hapen the program is long term but with short goals we want the company to learn to think in smaler busines cycles of thre months what can you do in this time changing the learning dynamics of companies could you give examples of client who goes through this proces our portfolio in brazil has large corporations including coca cola itaú raízen and cielo at coca cola we are helping to implement set of principles to change the way it organizes itself conects with the public and solves consumer problems this means shortening the release cycle going from two or thre years to thre or four months has the company already launched products on this inovation trail yes the first was line of family juices which hit the market along with digital tols that colect data on the product receptivity the second was natural soft drink new category in the world basicaly we don want to create mas products like coke zero but to understand the habits of each consumer if coca cola can be machine for understanding experimenting and launching with data driven culture it wil become more inteligent and closer to the consumer ci has also undergone transformation proces since its creation right the company was born in focused on software enginering at the begining of the comercial internet as busines tol we viewed the internet as gateway and specialized in specific technologies our focus was the national market this first chapter of our history lasted about years then the internationalization proces began leo ramos chaves campinas sp is home to one of the four ci development centers in the world what was the transition like from startup focused on brazil to global company in the anyone who wanted to participate in the information technology industry game on global level neded to have clasification seal for software manufacturers caled cmi acronym for integrated capability maturity model we were the first brazilian company to obtain it in from then on we signed contracts in the united states how did this hapen we got there by ofering customized software but the busines environment especialy in silicon valey showed that this was an outdated model the industry of the future was one of inovation it was necesary to master set of technologies and discover how they could create disruptions for companies and consumers the busines no longer meant siting around waiting for demand it was necesary to provoke the customer with technological oportunities and propose solutions and inovations at that time around social media smartphones cloud computing and the entire arsenal of big data began to emerge these forces changed what could be done with technology from consumer perspective certainly we now have bilions of people with device that fits in their pocket conected through social media generating bilions of data there was also drop in computational costs and the advent of artificial inteligence techniques this changed the game it was no longer posible to design software like before the posibilities were diferent how did you adapt to that moment we reduce bureaucracy in the way software is produced and create another value ofer for the market we overcome the busines model by specification and technical design and start working pluged into the client problems the enginering team aproached the busines team proactively we presented customers with technological posibilities that would alow them to generate digital asets and experiences it was the second chapter of ci which lasted until when we created the lean digital transformation proposal how does prisma the company headquarters in campinas fit into this new phase prisma is digital transformation co creation space opened in part of the cultural change we propose involves creating colaborative environments where people exchange ideas and release what we cal colective inteligence it is necesary to physicaly dismantle staid corporate environments and create new spaces with fewer symbols of power and hierarchy something that is already hapening in silicon valey in the coming months we wil create second ci prisma in california wil it house ci busines unit in the united states yes we already serve motorola johnson johnson and gogle among other clients for gogle we create finance and marketing software but our relationship is as partner notably in machine learning and cloud computing leo ramos chaves opened at the end of the company central building has environments that encourage co creation ci is present in which markets united states canada china japan and europe notably in england half of the revenue of more than milion in is generated in brazil and the rest abroad mainly in the united states with around of international revenue here the entire portfolio is digital transformation but abroad this ofer represents of the total the rest are contracts focused on inovation in two years we should have of the portfolio in this value proposition how is the company growing in the last years we have doubled in size every thre years on average and we want to reach bilion in keping more than of the busines abroad the foreign market is competitive ruler since the united states is the first division of our industry we have to win the game there how is the sector structured in the digital world the traditional vision of is absolutely anachronistic in which you have laboratory with phds disconected from the customer reality creating things of value try to find the area of gogle or amazon it imposible each gogle enginer is an inovation cel that how like to think about ci the word has never ben aplied to the software industry and as every industry is becoming software industry it aplies les and les so what is the role of ci development centers these centers located in campinas belo horizonte tokyo in japan and nimbo in china concentrate intensive human capital proceses for the production of clients digital platforms such as aplications comerce portals databases for big data it is analytics belo horizonte is our export hub focused on remote technologies and services destined for the united states campinas focuses on the financial retail and comerce areas the centers in china and japan develop technologies for smartphones and comerce we have six other busines units in total there are more than employes in the united states in china in japan and around in europe how much do you invest in inovation and how big is the team dedicated to it can answer recently gogle facebok and silicon valey companies anounced that they would no longer require an enginering degre here at ci our talent atraction proceses have ben hands on an expresion in english that means come here work with us develop solutions and se if it makes sense to work together does the diploma then make no diference our hiring has litle to do with degre although most of the employes come from unicamp and usp university of são paulo but that not the starting point in selection proceses we prioritize candidates skils learning sped and ability to colaborate in

sanford is new zealand oldest and largest fishing company but don let the company age fol you sanford puts modern technology inovation and sustainability first to make sure their position as seafod industry leaders wil remain for at least another years june saw sanford go live with the bigest system change they have sen as busines the scope of the change has ben to implement manufacturing execution systems mes inova into seafod procesing sites and dep sea vesels and enterprise wide microsoft to the nz and australian busineses including multiple inventory holding locations and several tol manufacturing sites the project was originaly scoped in and had to contend with design requirements and early build and integrations being completed during the covid lockdown periods from suply chain perspective the project was complex given the range of verticaly integrated value chains that exist in the busines and the ned to ensure high bar in traceability due to regulatory requirements acros the seafod sector there was also requirement to improve the visibility of products in transit and integrate with customers and logistics services supliers acurate product costing given the nature of primary production and disagregation of seafod and the cost to serve were also requirements was sen as platform on which the busines could grow into the future and ad aditional functionality once the core was embeded other areas to be further explored include integrated busines planing ibp and aset management some of the key learnings to come from the project have ben the ned for strong program infrastructure ways of working project management tols resources as wel as strong governance and project management leadership having executive sponsorship and board suport is key to alignment on project objectives and priorities once the scope is confirmed as there wil always be choices to be made once the project starts and asumptions around resource and cost are tested it was important for sanford to complete capability and capacity review of its resources and where diferent and aditional skil sets were identified they were brought into the project the project has delivered growth in people capabilities as they have had to find new ways of working acros fuly integrated system and build more technical knowledge the go live has ben huge change initiative for sanford which has impacted almost everyone throughout the organisation in some way over the last couple of years the build up to go live in terms of planing and data migration was significant al of sanford inventory its purchasing and manufacturing integrations acros its procesing and storage sites went live simultaneously this was also made more complex by complete overhaul of al its product master data the data maping work involved in over skus acros over inventory locations acros rd party logistics rd party manufacturing vesels and sanford sites was in itself an epic piece of work understanding the importance of master data had ben growing steadily over the project timeline and with several master data champions acros the busines the focus in this area had ben worthwhile investment integrations with mes and with other external partners were found to be more resource intensive and chalenging than originaly asumed having designs for both erp and mes in state of flux at the same time presented some unique chalenges for our integration teams in terms of pining down filed mapings and building firm functional and technical design documents there was no blueprint for our erp to mes integration with the teams neding to iterate and make practical choices on the way through the level of colaboration required acros our busines program and partner teams was significant and high degre of rework was experienced as we learned more and revisited optimized our design overal the integration team delivered al the temporary integrations mes to legacy erp and over long term integration points

to come to sucesful go live there is certainly more work to do to stabilise and optimise busines proceses and data so our busines stakeholders must se the curent and future benefits they have sought through this project we now have the start of journey into the future to showcase and deliver our beautiful new zealand seafod to both local and international customers reduction in paper and energy consumption time savings cost cuts and an improved customer experience are some of the benefits resulting from two proces improvements introduced by the busines transformation ofice the busines proces enablement bpe programe has developed forms to met the majority of digital form neds for the university with staf encouraged to use the digital version rather than the former paper records working acros the university the bpe programe has uncovered total forms of which were designated as no longer required and have ben digitised with an estimated form submisions anualy the paper mountain son builds up based on an average of two pages per paper form and asuming each paper form is printed out only twice this equates to stagering pieces of paper each year the environmental cost of this is

growth in their online market during the covid lockdown the company has sen mas aceleration in the digital space with over shopers registering for online shoping in one night his advice before you start on digital transformation which is term thrown around lightly by organisations and invest in digital technology you realy ned to understand your busines strategy and customer value proposition digital technology is merely tol to suport what you want to achieve as busines and so it vital you know what that is do you realy know what your customers want steve says digital transformation was always going to hapen but the pandemic has acelerated its implementation us speaker josh buckley defined digital transformation as the adoption of digital technology to transform services or busineses replacing non digital or manual proceses with digital proceses or replacing older technology with newer technology in order to amplify and enable human potential hailing from the construction industry josh emphasised the focus must be on efectivenes and eficiency ask yourself why and how am doing this he emphasized that introducing new technology for its own sake is meaningles instead introduce new idea or new efective workflow and then find the technology that wil enable that branding and marketing expert derek sun from opo defined digital transformation as aplying technology to create significant competitive advantages if there are no significant competitive advantages created then don think it can be caled transformative it incremental progresion rather than transformation leveraging digital platforms can create new busines models like uber or airbnb ultimately its about the value that technology brings to companies this requires continuous learning be curious about

cities are major source of carbon emisions our expert panel discused how we reduce the climate impact of the built environment the legal profesion is finaly experiencing the digital disruption that has swept through so many industries over the last decade it transforming al aspects of lawyering creating new ways of working in new markets with new roles and opening up new oportunities while traditional conventions wane law graduates who understand the impact of digital inovations and are comfortable working with technology wil be at an advantage with employers so legal education neds to provide students with the technical skils to thrive in the digital world and also the ability to navigate the complex ethical legal and social implications of new technologies while our future lawyers ned to work in digital world it remains al the more important to recognise the value of some important elements of traditional legal education including research critical thinking and analytical skils this blend of old and new capabilities is the best chance we have to thrive in rapidly changing world there are areas where the digital transformation wil be significant we re already seing the impact in discovery where artificial inteligence is both replacing work product from lawyers and at the same time improving the experience of law practice other changes might create new types of legal work in new markets for example providing online high volume low cost advice to under served constituencies at melbourne law schol for example the students in our law aps clas work in teams with not for profit clients to develop on line legal information sources to provide asistance to those who might otherwise strugle to understand their legal rights and duties other aspects of the law however wil remain more complex and nuanced and require greater human input than predicted by those who forese the end of traditional law firms as legal educators we ned to draw on the best of the past while being inovative about responding to the future some of the traditional values of high quality legal education remain pertinent maybe even increasingly so in rapidly changing world these elements should not be sacrificed when loking at reforms although the precise way in which they are taught may ned some modification the nature of legal research for example might be changing but the ned for high quality research skils is not careles and il defined search can give rise to torent of barely relevant unimportant materials from around the world the porly trained law graduate haplesly reproduces as much of it as posible hoping that the right answer wil mysteriously arise from the sea of information students must understand the questions they are researching have dep familiarity with the best research tols for the particular task understand the hierarchies at play in terms of court structures and forms of law and have god judgment about which sources to use and when none of these skils is straightforward and al of them require seriou educational efort both in law schol and in profesional training creating oportunities for serious dep and structured interdisciplinary experiences is another important aspect of contemporary legal education it is likely interdisciplinary groups wil give rise to the most inovative workplaces and solve the most intractable problems of our time for profesion in which development has tended to be evolutionary and incremental for much of its history the legal profesion is now faced with pace of change that has put serious presure on many lawyers as law firms examine their practices and adjust to the new world other competitors and new ways of providing legal advice emerge the patern of change and chalenge to the existing ways of doing things is likely to continue indefinitely law schols likewise face chalenges in responding to this new environment with the number of graduate places for young lawyers diminishing they must focus on both readying their students for those places and also preparing them for other roles in which their knowledge and skils can be used in adapting to met these new chalenges it is important law schols recognise that some of the traditional skils they impart to students wil continue to be valuable for long time to come but neither can they close their eyes to the environment into which students are graduating and they ned to be inovative and responsive in creating oportunities for students to develop new skils sets that wil set them up to suced even as the expectations of lawyers continues to shift over time to mark law wek may pursuit is loking at some of the isues facing the profesion in the st century baner image lady justice by alex proimos from sydney australia wikimedia can knowing to much harm us when it comes to medicine in some cases yes absolutely finding and treating diseases early saves lives and reduces health costs it is why health systems have ben increasingly undertaking proactive screning administering clinical tests on individuals who don have any symptoms but may be at risk examples include screning for diseases like bowel cancer or breast cancer the ubiquity of digital technologies in our lives has the potential to take proactive screning to new level digital screning this involves using information colected by our smartphones smartwatches keyboards social networks and wearable technology and analysing it using artificial inteligence algorithms to identify at risk individuals for example the early onset of parkinson disease could be identified from the changing paterns of how someone types while the risk of heart problems can be identified from abnormal heart rhythms detected by smartwatch while al this may sound god the problem is that proactive screning can find things that might not be worth finding there is overwhelming evidence that some diagnostic tests used in screning can find abnormalities that while meting the curent definition of disease might have never made some people sick these diseases that would have never generated any problems are what we cal cases of overdiagnoses and can lead to unecesary and sometimes harmful treatments and the emergence of digital screning could make this problem worse overdiagnosis as phenomenon has ben sen in many wel known diseases from some comon cancers to atention deficit disorder the most comon scenario of overdiagnosis is when we actively sek diseases in asymptomatic patients especialy among healthier segments of the population for example in some countries screning for thyroid cancer has led to two fold increase in the incidence of thyroid cancer but no change in mortality in other words the screning hasn reduced deaths similarly studies have shown that screning for atention deficit hyperactivity disorder in children can lead to simply the youngest children in schol clas being diagnosed overdiagnosis has ben observed for many cancers including prostate cancer and breast cancer as wel as conditions like chronic kidney disease gestational diabetes high blod presure and autism spectrum disorder the extent of overdiagnosis is dificult to quantify but one report has sugested that an estimated per cent of al cancers in australia may be cases of overdiagnosis one reason behind overdiagnosis is the constant advance of technology with newer more sensitive tests being developed among the latest advances in medicine is the posibility of using the masive amount of data we generate every day to find clues that might point to undiagnosed diseases throughout our day we use smartphones type emails interact on social media and count our steps on our smartwatches using artificial inteligence the data can be used to find paterns that might help us detect diseases at an earlier stage the colection and use of medical data raise ethical concerns like those of privacy and data security nonetheles this is very exciting time and many benefits wil probably emerge from these technologies but just as with traditional diagnostic methods overdiagnosis is stil risk that should be adresed so what can we do in our recently published paper we propose using data banks of longitudinal patient information data colected over long periods of time to analyse the historical trajectories of diferent diseases and identify those subgroups of patients who won be significantly afected if at al by given disease this data driven aproach could be used to improve disease definitions considering patient trajectories and identify the clinical atributes that might in the future alow clinicians to more acurately distinguish diagnosis from an overdiagnosis in pilot study we conducted using us hospital database with hundreds of thousands of hospital admisions we trained an artificial inteligence algorithm to predict which patients were likely to develop sepsis in the next hours sepsis is complication of an infection in which the body own imune response begins to damage tisues and organs we then loked at the patients flaged by the algorithm who actualy went on to develop sepsis based on oficial diagnostic criteria among them we found that almost per cent of them had trajectories that apeared to be identical to those who never went on to develop sepsis this sugests that we ned more work on defining what is and what isn sepsis the huge amounts of data that technology alows us to colect and analyse is an oportunity to beter identify people early who ned treatment before they become sick but we also ned to use big data to ensure we aren taking perfectly wel people and turning them into sick patients baner gety images futurists tel us we are on the brink of fourth industrial revolution this one is al about the digital and technological disruption of how we used to do things previous industrial revolutions saw many blue colar manufacturing jobs replaced by machines or disapear overseas to low labour cost countries developed economies like australia sucesfuly transitioned their labour force to white colar service jobs now these jobs are themselves under threat and the financial services sector is not imune many transactional services are moving online or are being replaced by ofshore cal centres and increasingly by virtual services robots or artificial inteligence systems yet the finance sector has also embraced and thrived on the oportunities created by digital disruption the traditional banking sector in particular is constantly chalenged by new nimble and highly competitive operators and must either change the tune of its service provision or face comercial oblivion the finance sector has in fact ben remarkably resilient to change in the ongoing capitalist batle of creative destruction financial institutions sem to have had markedly greater longevity than manufacturing corporations that could be explained by sustained lack of competition but it may also reflect an ability to adapt to new circumstances and adopt new technology like atms and internet banking whenever and wherever they arise there is no ned for the financial establishment to significantly invest in research and development itself banking corporations have adopted similar strategy to big pharmaceuticals let independent niche operators inovate and create start ups and ventures and when they suced simply buy them for example the sucesful australian upstarts specialising in low cost mortgage lending ausie and rams were eventualy bought by the traditional banks cba and westpac respectively the sector resilience is not just due to an ability to cope remarkably wel with external presure finance has become increasingly inovative and continuously reinvents itself to reduce the costs of regulation as wel as the delivery of beter products and services for customers regulators and legislators often strugle to kep pace with the latest developments in investment asets financial advice and risk management that often leaves new providers operating in regulatory vacum that only gets filed once things have gone teribly wrong or once lobying presure by the sector itself becomes to strong to ignore the cost of unregulated inovation on the public could be significant consider for example the fact that financial inovations like portfolio insurance and colateralised debt obligations contributed to the stock market crash and the global financial crisis respectively rather than wait for legislation and regulation to catch up we should therefore ask ourselves whether the ethics underpining these inovations pas the morality test digital technology wil arguably improve market aces for new niche financial institutions as wel as competition and make markets and services more eficient robot trading and advice can significantly reduce fes improve transparency and make financial services more acesible there is even sugestion that robot finance wil democratise the sector and lead to more just and fair financial system for al human foibles and manifestations of conflicts of interest can simply be switched of taking out human interaction could transform posibly imoral finance sector to an entirely amoral one where moral considerations simply have no role to play unfortunately this dehumanisation of finance raises its own ethical concerns as finance sector legislation regulation often significantly lags developments and practices how can we be sure that financial entrepreneurs even consider the ethical implications of their new busines models after al financial institutions often inovate to reduce the cost of regulation on conducting financial transactions these concerns extend from breaches of client information privacy to more generaly neglect of duty to clients perhaps surprisingly they sem to have increased with the introduction of digital technology service platforms while the platforms are notionaly neutral they don recognise client financial sophistication or lack thereof this digital revolution is rapidly replacing physical markets and bank branches and employes with online platforms and smartphone technology even the world of financial advice which is stil clinging to face to face transactions might wel be replaced by robot advice in the near future the platforms are cheap to develop easy to implement and efectively marketed this creates an entirely new competitive landscape with start ups and smal players specialising in specific services instantly becoming competitive entrants whereas regulators used to impose the same regimes on incumbents and newcomers who were thereby disadvantaged they now sem to provide regulatory exception to new initiatives public distrust of the finance sector has weakened the lobying power of the incumbents and convinced the regulators to encourage inovation and competition by newcomers the price paid however is posibly unchecked unethical behaviour by the inovators this is an edited extract from mater of trust the practice of ethics in finance by paul kofman and clare payne published by melbourne university pres more information is available here baner image gety images minute read in recent webinar panelists discused how the aplication of technology can adres critical ecological and urban design isues like adapting cities to climate change modern city planing neds great deal of data big problems like adapting our cities to the impacts of climate change require complex solutions digital technologies help urban designers pol diferent sources of data and consider their problems using systems thinking rather than aproaching them one project at time in our recent infrastructure webinar integrated design for resilient urban landscapes four panelists in conversation with city of melbourne mark alan discused how the aplication of technology can adres critical ecological and urban design isues watch webinar chief among the digital tols to tackle complex urban design isues are urban digital twins digital twin is virtual representation of the built and natural environment of cities the living entities with them and the proceses that make cities tick like transport networks there are thre main components in an urban digital twin said panelist dr soheil sabri senior research felow in urban analytics at the university of melbourne dr sabri managed the fishermans bend digital twin project the first urban digital twin component is the real world the second is the digital world where real world objects and proceses are represented the third is the underpining technology that conects the real world to the digital world and enables synchronisation betwen the two why are they useful an urban environment is complex dynamic environment where housing environment transport and many other factors work together any time you make change to one you re afecting al eight or nine other systems that are at work on the strets and in our public realm said panelist dr nano langenheim lecturer in landscape architecture and urban design at the university of melbourne urban designers can use digital twins to plug in data from several diferent sources to understand how these systems interact where relevant data is available in open data resources urban planing projects could save time and money however researchers and planers often colect data for specific purpose data colected for understanding the fre flow of trafic while representing the same strets may not have the information another researcher neds about fotpath quality what we are seing through digital transformation is certainly presure on maturity in the marketplace for understanding what the information management requirements are at the end of the project said panelist mr james barow mixed reality and digital enginering lead at ghd god data management standards that help define the type acuracy curency and purpose of data colected can ensure its longevity and that longevity starts with curiosity about what other users neds are mr barow explained ensurin the usability of data beyond single project increases its value city planers are already tackling the impacts of climate change increased rainfal rising sea levels and increasing temperatures the city of melbourne is using digital technologies and data in projects like increasing tre canopy cover and understanding the microclimates around the city to combat the efects of extreme heat events heat is in fact more dangerous kiler of people in australia than any other natural hazard said ms tifany crawford co chief heat oficer at the city of melbourne but she believes the solutions to climate change are available what it now requires is diferent thinking inovation and partnership think that the great minds watching this and present today are big part of that kep going ms crawford said learn more about infrastructure research first published on january technology continues to transform the practices of every organisation around the world but if we lok specificaly at the legal profesion these digital transformations can bring unanticipated legal and ethical risks in house legal departments used to be viewed as halowed black box and although it was unclear what they did their decisions were highly regarded in recent years in house lawyers have extended out into new areas of busines like environmental social and governance where they have larger role in designing and influencing the rest of their company general counsels are now devoting more time to strategic emphasis and les time to day to day busines as janet taylor hal chief executive of the legal service provider cognia law states in house lawyers engage with the sales team or procurement department siting down with them to develop templates contracts or negotiation rules most importantly there ben major change in the deployment of technology by in house legal departments to gather data analysing this data can identify emerging trends and provide early notice of larger problems like an increase in the number of new lawsuit claims report by the corporate legal operations consortium cloc shows more than half of the participants around per cent answered that their organisation views the legal department as totaly integrated into their strategy and busines acording to only thre per cent of respondents the in house legal department provides strictly legal advice australian busineses are now at risk of significantly higher cyber atacks because of their reliance on web based aplications but when it comes to cyber threat response only per cent of companies have comprehensive cyber threat response strategy that involves their legal departments cyber breaches can result not only in significant financial los but also in reputational damage so the intervention of competent legal team can mitigate those risks as an example of one of these privacy breaches human rights watch hrw has acused adobe conect aplication and minecraft education edition of violating their privacy policies and colecting children personal data for non educational purposes this highlights the ned for in house lawyers with extensive understanding of technology who are able to predict potential legal breaches and guide their employers throughout the early stages of new technology development australia privacy act curently under review is out of date in the digital age while legislators atempt to amend and suplement the relevant legislation to become more adaptable to technological change lawyers continue to face legal chalenges related to evolving digitalisation and it hard to say if these adaptions of the law realy go far enough recently consumer group choice investigated whether australian retailers kmart bunings and the god guys were violating the privacy act by using facial recognition technology to capture and colect faceprint of customers who entered selected stores around per cent of consumers were unaware that busineses used video cameras for this purpose stores using facial recognition technology in this way is similar to gathering your fingerprints or dna every time you shop under the privacy act biometric data gathered by facial recognition technology is considered sensitive personal data clearly existing laws are lacking when it comes to protecting us from potentialy harmful facial recognition technology in these cases it not clear whether the decision to deploy this technology wasn run past the legal teams in their respective organisations whether the legal teams under estimated the potential public backlash or if they didn have suficient understanding of the nuances of facial recognition to realise the potential risks or perhaps some combination of al thre in any case having tighter involvement with beter informed legal team may have raised concerns earlier or led to these organisations informing their customers in more transparent way it is very important to understand and examine how in house lawyers become involved in procuring designing deploying and overseing the emerging digital technologies in their firms and how they mitigate risks asociated with emerging technologies what is unclear is whether curent legal education and training is suficient for lawyers providing advice on emerging technology firstly for many new aplications of emerging technology there may be several areas of existing legislation that aply but most of these were designed without these technological advances in mind secondly often no precedent exists for many isues regarding emerging technology and this puts lawyers in position of neding to understand the implications of emerging technology and provide legal and ethical advice without clear legislation and precedents only once lawyers and law students understand the underlying legal and technical frameworks of emerging digital technology and are wel equiped to respond to technology related isues wil they be able to mitigate the legal risks asociated with them the centre for ai and digital ethics caide is launching new project to ensure that lawyers understand the underlying legal and technical frameworks of emerging digital technology the four year project new legal thinking for emerging technologies is funded by the menzies foundation under the ninian stephen law program the first phase is to understand how lawyers curently adres these problems if you are an in house lawyer who has given legal or ethical advice on technology we invite you for one hour online interview please contact dr

work with each competency centre team to ask for expert suport in key area of digital technology the curent competency centres suport cybersecurity research cloud computing and workflow automation new centres being introduced in include imersive technologies and ai and ml suport each competency centre can share expertise in new digital solutions through training advice and suport for oxford people academics researches profesional services staf and relevant students each centre is made up of smal group of dedicated staf who wil suport you in growing your confidence and competence as the university moves though its digital transformation they provide fre training fre consultancy and help your team to deploy new technologies you can read more about oxford competency centres the programe manager for the shared infrastructure services programe is brendan donely the programe wil be delivering on the work of the it infrastructure services review and wil facilitate more conected and colaborative it infrastructure acros the university work has begun to consult with coleagues acros the divisions to determine priorities for this academic year based on the initiatives from the service review the programe wil lok to define what shared service is then find and create those services and suport them with members acros the divisions further comunications wil folow during the next few weks and months the data programe manager is alex gray this programe wil implement the new data strategy which aims to improve data governance through improved proceses and technology and make that data more easily available through improved bi reporting signposting to reports and aces to data via integration these improvements suport other digital transformation and it projects university strategic initiatives such as profesional service reviews and value for money review and reduce burden on staf we asked profesor sir nigel shadbolt for his views on oxford and ai nigel is principal of jesus colege profesorial research felow and head of human centred computing in computer science university of oxford email so required the new framework wil create greater alignment to university priorities simplify and sped up decision making and put more emphasis on user focused digital experiences it wil also provide clearer view acros the institution of what digital services are available to staf and students and at what cost as part of the foundation phase of oxford university digital transformation programe we identified that one of the most important suces criteria for sustained and real impact of any digital changes is the governance and delivery of digital services and infrastructure acordingly working group was set up to consider the existing it governance and options for the future folowing its review the group has made recomendations on digital governance how we decide what to do operations how we do it and on organisational structures how we structure the organisation to operate efectively the review found that the way the university governs it is to narowly focused on just the it part and not the busines part the proposed governance framework shifts the focus from it technology to governance embeded more in the university mision and busines and extends the scope to include data information and cybersecurity the review of our existing it governance aproach found several themes including silos there are to many comites operating in silos siloed and slower decision making project based funding not efectively tensioned against other neds not suficiently tied into university priorities the comites lack integration with busines in terms of strategic input and alignment with strategic ned prioritisation and implementation curent it board model is not working apropriately portfolio scrutiny group key decision making body not enough user focus user design not embeded in projects suficiently early insuficient engagement with divisional structures not enough focus on data data governance is floating in our governance touched on in various comites focused on in none complexity the joint subcomites model does not interact efectively with other university comites to ensure strategy priorities driven by busines ned it comite is not properly pluged into our governance in general does not lead to proces simplification doesn enable service improvement model not enough focus on cybersecurity prioritisation of cybersecurity investments is not properly oversen or considered it is considered by jisag which reports into security subcomite but we ned clearer focus on cybersecurity services lack of continuity and consistency staf engaged in project delivery may be moved to deliver in other areas without the knowledge of the asociated subcomite over time the portfolio comites wil overse the delivery of services through service streams with responsible owners for the management of the service streams and service stream delivery teams who wil maintain and improve the services in time for mt new information and digital comite idc wil replace the existing it comite the idc wil be responsible for strategy and policy related to digital services and infrastructure data information and cybersecurity five portfolio comites wil be created that report to idc they are responsible for services in the areas of education research engagement and disemination administration and technology the new comite structure wil be put in place to begin from mt portfolio has two modes governance and delivery this mode includes overseing aproving monitoring governing tracking deciding and guiding projects services and spend al portfolios wil transition to the new governance model from mt new way of delivering projects and services by bringing resources teams together into delivery groups for the particular portfolio over time this wil help to depen the expertise and knowledge of coleagues working within particular portfolio the new operating model wil be piloted with the education portfolio in mt the other portfolio comites wil focus only on governance and not delivery at this this time this wil require identifying the portfolio suport and service stream owners and providing guidance training and suport as we work through the implementation of the new model at the same time key asets wil ned to be created that wil be required by the comites and teams review of the pilot wil be completed in trinity term which wil inform the further development of the remaining portfolios the new digital governance framework provides clearer view acros the institution of what digital services are available to staf and students and at what cost at present this information is not available and sits in many budget lines acros the institution the aim of the proposed changes to governance and the operating model are to shift the delivery of services to be more closely aligned with the busines strategy and user neds the change to the funding and delivery model has ben made to alow more agile and continuous improvement aproach and to move away from our existing project driven way of working the model is based on service stream delivery teams which wil alow us to build experienced teams knowledgeable in both the busines ned and digital capabilities most importantly this aims to reduce siloed decision making proces whilst at the same time increasing the capability to prioritise spend efectively the digital transformation programe team wil continue to exist and wil suport delivery of the programe during this transition period dedicated change management team wil overse the seting up of the portfolios the creation of the asets to suport the portfolios providing the training and suport for the comites asisting in provision of training for service stream owners and in the specific case of he education portfolio suporting the service stream delivery teams as wel the change management team wil also be responsible for the delivery in due course of the changes recomended by the it infrastructure service review we recognise that there wil be significant period of transition to bed in the new governance project and service delivery identifying and responding to skil gaps and potentialy implementing organisational change to suport service and new governance delivery the ful implementation of the governance framework and operating model is expected to take at least months and posibly as long as months this may apear to be slow transition but the sugested timing takes into acount the potential organisational operational changes that wil be the outcome of the it infrastructure service review and the continuing series of activities within the digital transformation programe the implementation of the new governance framework and operating model are transformative in how we envisage digital services and infrastructure and how they are integrated into planing and embeded to ensure the institution is digitaly fit for the future once this transition is complete which may take up to two years the digital transformation programe becomes busines as usual and the programe team can be disbanded if you have any questions or concerns please speak with your existing comite chair or line manager or you can email the programe team at email so required ugr experts

caled industry previously mentioned kagerman in the core of is the implementation of cyber physical systems cps for industrial production it is that is networks of microcomputers sensors and actuators embeded in materials machines or products that are conected along the value chain porter hepelman and the availability of sophisticated systems to proces and analyze big data in real time simulation augmented reality systems integration cloud computing cybersecurity and aditive manufacturing are other technologies wel known enablers belantuono et al lorenz et al al these technologies significantly expand the production posibilities and consumption and represent disruptive technological change more specificaly generates new value propositions for highly personalized products or diferentiated wel synchronized combinations of products and services and aded value belantuono et al is inded paradigm enabled by technology which is profoundly changing the way companies organize their proceses and create value for customers companies are increasingly aware that digital technologies enable completely new busines models and lead to the reconfiguration of the structure of al sectors leaving out those companies that wil not be able to adapt to change belantuono et al therefore it is esential that companies inovate and rethink their busines models busines burmeister et al ibara et al as wel as inovate their proceses and products to take advantage of the chalenges and growth oportunities generated by new digital technologies belantuono et al in recent years many scholars investigated the paradigm from diferent perspectives however the existing literature focuses mainly on aspects technological les atention is devoted to management and organizational aspects asociated with digital transformation cimini et al bordeleau felden development of digital transformation model of geographic data to through information and comunications technologies icts for example they argue that there are no frameworks or models that adequately suport managers and organizations in al phases of the digital transformation proces and require more structured aproaches to manage the transition to the paradigm belantuono et al below is presentation of the digital transformation models existing and roadmaps for the transition consider lesons learned in the field of change management wel known aproach developed to sucesfuly manage change initiatives with this objective review is caried out systematic review of the literature to identify dtms dtms digital transformation developed to manage the transition to the paradigm the results are then analyzed through the lens of change management literature to do this the main change management models are reviewed and compared and identifies the set of activities to include in any transformation initiative delimiting where the greatest development in dtm is located who have ben its main authors and what are the main fields of aplication of dtm figure development in digital transformation models dtm chapter in terms of the statistics obtained on the development in transformation models digital dtm it is observed that the area of computer sciences has the highest volume of knowledge generation with it is folowed by the busines area management and acounting with and in third place are the areas of sciences of decision and enginering with figure in the context of the digital transformation towards industry any initiative it is considered proces of change that is transition from curent state with certain level of digitalization towards future state with higher level of digitalization therefore change management is adopted as methodological aproach in the article to analyze the dtms proposed in the literature models are described and examined known change management methods in order to identify the activities that should be be included in any transformation initiative belantuono and al since change has become inevitable in organizational life due to development global economic and technological burnes cumings worley the organizations increasingly ned change management skils the management of change refers to structured aproach to facilitate the transition from curent state of the organization to desired future state balogun hailey it involves renewing the direction structure and capabilities of an organization to met the neds changing neds of internal and external customers moran brightman it also refers to the proces and tols used to suport people in the transition creasey next the models of best known change management belantuono et al development of digital transformation model from geographic data to through information and comunications technologies icts figure overview of change management models source taken from belantuono et al kurt lewin change management model figure is considered the precursor of curent models acording to this thre step model before making changes to organization it is necesary for members to abandon their old behaviors the steps of the model are belantuono et al yo unfreze members become aware of the ned for change and motivates those who wil be afected change new behaviors are introduced and changes in atitudes are developed organizational structures and proceses refreze the organization stabilizes in new state of equilibrium where new behaviors are consolidated on the other hand koter step model of change figure is widely used the steps are belantuono et al chapter yo establish sense of urgency build powerful guiding coalition create shared vision iv comunicate the vision efectively empower others to act on the vision saw plan and create short term victories vi consolidate improvements and produce more changes vi institutionalize new aproaches figure koter step model of change source taken from koter ge change aceleration proces cap polk von der lin is is based on the premise that the suces of change initiative not only depends on high quality technical solutions but also to pay atention to people afected by the change the pac consists of seven steps belantuono et al yo lead change strong and comited leadership takes charge of the initiative exchange create shared ned the reason for the change is clearly defined and shared with al interested parties development of digital transformation model such from geographic data to through information and comunications technologies icts shaping vision clear and legitimate vision of the future is articulated after of the change comunicating it to al interested parties iv mobilize comitment sense of comitment and involvement of al people involved in the change make the change last implementation begins with pilot projects using the suceses and knowledge acquired for other initiatives and adresing the factors that hinder change saw monitor the proces progres is measured and problems are detected during the implementation vi changing systems and structures after implementation the organizational structure to ensure the permanence of the change on the other hand prosci thre phase change management proces creasey prosci is based on the adkar model figure which focuses on suporting people through change the proces consists of thre phases belantuono et al yo prepare for change change management plans are designed including awarenes of the ned for change the definition of change the formation of change management team identification of sponsor identifying afected groups and developing management strategy change manage change comunication plans are developed and implemented training sponsor roadmap training and resistance management reinforce change people fedback is colected and analyzed afected the adoption of the change is measured gaps are corected and the suces chapter figure prosci thre phase change management proces source taken from creasey prosci in the systematic review proces relevant contributions were identified that adres the guiding questions among these contributions are various digital transformation models dtm proposed by diferent authors erol et al propose an transformation model in thre stages envision enable and enact during the envision stage we sek to develop participatory vision of involving stakeholders then in the enable stage converts the vision into concrete busines model and develops strategies for its implementation sucesful implementation finaly in the enact stage the strategies are converted into real projects on the other hand schalmo et al develop five phase roadmap for the digital transformation these phases include digital reality digital ambition potential digital adjustment and digital implementation each phase adreses diferent related aspects with value creation customer requirements best practices and integration with partners in the framework proposed by is sa et al for the implementation of in manufacturing organizations several steps are established these include the formation of working group the evaluation of digitalization the definition of aproaches the use case idea generation impact estimation and case selection of use acording to the level of maturity of the organization development of digital transformation model of geographic data to through information and comunications technologies icts romero et al present lean digital transformation framework that combines lean practices and tols in five management pilars this aproach includes management digital strategy which involves defining long term digital vision evaluating the maturity digital and select apropriate technologies and work methods le grand deneckere propose an agile change management model that consists of thre phases definition experimentation and anchoring in the definition phase diagnosis in the experimentation phase workshop and control cycles are caried out and in the anchoring phase an overview of completed and future projects is provided along with an analysis of the capacity for change ng et al define conceptual model for the systematic development of planing plans digitalization action in companies this model includes stages such as the evaluation of the curent busines model the design of the digital busines model the evaluation of the curent digital capabilities the identification of future digital capabilities and the development of the action plan rautenbach et al propose conceptual model of digital transformation in two phases evaluation of the curent value creation proces and internal and external evaluation of the organization these asesments lead to the creation of job creation profiles value and digital profiles which guide the organization in creating value by taking advantage the digital dimension pesl et al propose model to evaluate the digital maturity of companies and develop an action plan its focus is on bridging the gap betwen the state curent and objective state of digital transformation this idea is directly related with the methodological framework proposed by leone barni who sugest suporting smes in their digital transformation by identifying inovation gaps and converting them in integration projects its aproach seks to help companies with resources limited to achieving sucesful transformation on the other hand but proposes framework based on the busines proces tradition management bpm to optimize busines proceses during transformation digital their focus is on redesigning proceses to adapt to the digital age this idea is also related to the conceptual framework presented by van tonder et al chapter who es highlight the importance of inovation in the busines model during the digital transformation both aproaches sek to ensure that the proceses and model busines are aligned with the organization digital objectives regarding the integration of social technologies and iot mendhurwar mishra highlight its importance in digital transformation but also point out the chalenges of asociated security and privacy this idea coincides with the proposal of nikitin kulchytsky who propose digital transformation management model based on the strategic relationship betwen government society companies and software developers both aproaches consider the ethical and security as key elements during the digital transformation proces finaly ou et al present specific decision making framework for the digital transformation in the retail industry its focus is on identifying busines problems set goals and execute transformation plan this idea highlights the importance of strategic planing and proper execution during the digital transformation proces in general these theories and aproaches converge on the importance of evaluating maturity digital identify gaps redesign proceses inovate in the busines model and consider ethical and security aspects during digital transformation also know highlights the ned for strategic planing and colaboration betwen diferent actors to achieve sucesful transformation these main ideas provide solid foundation to adres the chalenges and take advantage of the oportunities that arise in the context of digital transformation in companies this research was based on the partial aplication of the digital transformation framework for the colombian state designed by the mintic this framework is based on the compliance with article of law of national development plan the which establishes that the td component must be incorporated into the action plans of state entities to this end gather

are answered where is the greatest development located in digital transformation models and who have ben their main authors and rq what are the main fields of aplication of transformation models digital and aditionaly the references or the construct for modeling the digital transformation reference framework object of this document figure figure construct for td framework design rq what are the most used ict components in the digital transformation models as has ben mentioned throughout the conceptual framework the motivation to implementing digital transformation models in organizations is to facilitate the development of digital transformation model from geographic data to through information and comunications technologies icts enabling your capabilities to leverage your digital transformation through reinvention or modification of its proceses products or services ensuring the value generation mintic for this purpose icts are made available that they facilitate overcoming technological organizational and infrastructure gaps from the mintic frameworks and models of digital transformation are proposed for public and private organizations in the country regarding digital technologies they propose an ict prioritization scheme based on organizational objectives this can detailed in the folowing figure figure strategic priority of icts in the adoption of td models source taken from mintic note that large part of the icts listed in figure obey to characteristics of industry and technologies based on artificial inteligence cloud computing and the internet of things cab and note that implementation times are relative and sugested for colombian context however this realy varies depending on the type the organisation similarly the ministry of information technology and comunications mintic has proposed guide of guidelines for the acquisition and use of technologieschapter emerging in public and private entities with service provision characteristics mintic acording to the mintic emerging technologies refer to new technologies that are under development or wil be developed in the next five to ten years and that wil substantialy alter the busines and social environment mintic in the curent context of technological bom and the arival of industry technologies emerging technologies known as emerging icts are emerging rapidly is it is important to note that emerging technologies are not necesarily new but which can also be implemented in particular context and represent novelty mintic the guide proposed by the mintic consists of four stages with several steps in each of them them mintic these stages are the folowing yo understand and create strategies to develop ict implementation strategies based on objectives of the entity identify posible aplications of icts verify the feasibility of the implementation design to establish prerequisites and evaluate the curent state of the entity develop pilot test enable to enable the necesary capabilities in relation to the structure organizational establish governance model that alows maintaining and improving the icts iv implement and sustain to implement changes at the institutional level train and develop internal talent in the new environment of the entity in the colombian sphere the ict sector refers to the digitalization of the state and the adoption of production proceses that comply with the most technological standards advanced mintic acording to the mintic this sector promotes programs and development of digital transformation model of geographic data to through information and comunications technologies icts projects that strengthen digital citizen skils and establish aliances public private that generate development for the country mintic after the covid contingency the technology and comunications sector is in reactivation proces demonstrating the importance of digital system modern that covers the entire national teritory busines inteligence headquarters external inteligence cordination curently the sector focuses on thre project aproaches to continue with the modernization of the country inteligence headquarters of busines external inteligence cordination these aproaches are yo digital transformation promote the intensive use of and icts in proceses productive electronic comerce msmes and their value chain with the objective of increasing productivity and competitivenes in global markets programer training given the demand for specialized profesionals in emerging icts it is necesary to promote training and training in programing and asociated technologies to ensure qualified workforce and competitive conectivity expand fiber optic coverage to conect more municipalities throughout the country thus guaranteing adequate infrastructure that alows the aces to digital services it is esential that the ict sector is informed about policies and programs of the country such as the national development plan and the initiatives of the mintic to take informed decisions that benefit companies and citizens in general mintic government initiatives such as transformation centers digital have generated significant advances in busines development and the adoption of emerging technologies mintic furthermore it is relevant to mention suces stories in the implementation of icts at the level international which include curent trends in icts aligned with the industry such as cyber physical systems internet of things big data artificial inteligence among others mintic the sucesful implementation of these technologies has demonstrated thechapter importance of having digital transformation models that suport managers in the implementation and development of dynamic capabilities mintic in the context of industry digital transformation in the manufacturing industry involves complex changes that require reformulating busines models and adapting new aproaches to digital transformation mintic for this six are proposed design principles for digital transformation in the manufacturing industry interoperability virtualization local talent real time talent decentralization and customer orientation mintic these principles help guide implementation sucesful digital transformation in this key sector of the economy although the colombian mintic itself recomends strategies for the adoption of digital transformation and the integration of emerging technologies into proceses organizational there are also cases of suces in the implementation of icts at the level international whose main findings are documented below acording to becera the main curent trends in icts aligned with the industry are systems development the internet of things the internet of things people and services aditive manufacturing printing reverse enginering big data and analytics artificial inteligence unmaned vehicles cybersecurity among others in the framework of digital transformation the implementation of these icts favor the digitization of industrial systems and proceses as wel as their interconection through the iot big data cloud computing and cybersecurity along with others specific to the context such as wireles sensors augmented reality robotics and devices framed in smart environments becera generaly when considering td in an organization managers understand the concept and aproaches but they are not always clear how to implement it here it is where td models come in to provide suport to managers through methods tols and technologies that promote and facilitate transformation bordeleau felden some authors sugest that the development of dynamic capabilities could serve as the basis for sucesful transformation similarly bordeleau felden sugest that both structured td methods and the development of digital and ofice capabilities are necesary but flexibility is required in the development of digital transformation model of geographic data to through information and comunications technologies icts aproach to change management and knowledge management due to the uncertainty of the environment in industry with the advance of industry icts began to have strong impact on the manufacturing industry digital transformation through emerging technologies was begining to be priority in companies producing gods the transformation it is not only digital but also social since it involves measures of change of paradigm and knowledge transfer oztemel gursev for the industry traditional manufacturing these changes tend to be quite complex for which they ned to reformulate busines models and adapt new transformation models digital oriented to each case after rigorous systematic literature review oztemel gursev define six design principles for td in the manufacturing industry interoperability virtualization local talent real time talent service orientation and modularity within the framework of oztemel gursev describe some of the aproaches that would facilitate digital transformation in organizations of which the folowing stand out cyber physical systems iot cloud computing smart factories smart cities digital manufacturing augmented reality and simulation mining data and robotics alcácer cruz machado ad big data to this list the cybersecurity and aditive manufacturing emphasizing the importance of cyber physical systems and the iot for smart factories as wel as the internet of things services such as key technologies for organizations now td and icts always go hand in hand towards development organizational both for private entities as wel as public entities literature reports various findings in the use of icts within the digital transformation framework for state government and public sector entities an example of this are the guides developed by mintic that sek to bring entities closer publics towards digital transformation through maturity and td models in adition gomez et al study the behavior of icts in public entities colombians identifying technological strategic and character gaps administrative that entities present when adresing emerging technologies in their entities chapter bula páez et al recomends working on beter articulation of entities governments in charge of meting the digital transformation goals since it is observed that some indicators agred in plans programs and initiatives colombians have not reached their goal due to the lack of joint work betwen the parts folowing this thread the td with municipal administration focus seks to advance in technological gaps and the development of companies citizens and other groups of the city that actively participate in the td in this order of ideas cities inteligent technologies require not only icts but also digital transformation models that facilitate the adoption of these technologies it is important to study the oportunities of technology and data for each geographic productive economic and sociocultural context of the countries that is their market economy services production inovation migration resilience infrastructure interactions among others and involve the citizenship within the chalenges towards the smart city hamamurad et al low the broad framework that is smart cities the most considered technologies are grouped into two groups icts that sek to guarante conectivity to the new digital world in way quickly and safely in colaborative way and that involves the comunity acompanied of sensors that detect changes in the environment favoring traceability prevention of adversity and resilience fields also fal into this group of study such as gis trend analysis and colaborative work hamamurad et al data procesing most of the data procesing technologies fal into this group industry that facilitate the colection procesing and analysis of data as for example iot big data and cloud computing within this field research into new technologies is also evaluated such as new materials robotics new construction methods printing among others that promote the development of smart cities hamamurad et al smart cities also involve transportation management and tols it for solving trafic problems co in megacities curently development of digital transformation model of geographic data to through information and comunications technologies icts geographic data digital cartography and gis are some of the most used if we hope to achieve smart city chehri et al yamamoto presents very particular case of aplication of icts in the framework of geographic data science since it uses icts as an infrastructure tol digital to prevent disasters and formulate contingency strategies in japan the authors propose gis social network mechanism which involves comunication services social network the social network twiter and web gis available in japan thus creating colaborative tol with strong social impact and inovative content this is example of how to relate icts with geographic data science within the framework of digital transformation for the benefit of the comunity to conclude this section it is highlighted that the implementation of icts has left series of chalenges in education and the step towards digital transformation since they have changed the traditional form of learning to one based on digital becera which requires the cordination of each role within an organization from management strategic to the operational level acording to the findings found in the literature it can be sen that most of studies on the implementation of gis and geographic data in td contexts focus on improving transportation routing maping and road infrastructure gonzález jaramilo haklay et al prah štrubelj yamamoto whose ultimate goal is to promote development towards smart city through icts chehri et al daniel doran hamamurad et al that are suported by technologies to guarante digital transformation from the operational activities of each industry to government cordination and citizen participation theoretical framework this chapter aims to bring the reader closer to conceptual aproach and contextualization to the concepts and notions that wil be worked on throughout the document as wel as the most notable generalities in these fields to search for information in this section structured indexed and unstructured also known as gray literature which theoreticaly define the concepts to be treated and they provide information on the curent context of these fields geographic data science in the field of science there are multiple branches of knowledge that as it is in this case they are usualy intertwined to share and create new knowledge aribas bel reades point out that computer and information sciences have ben intertwined with geographical sciences which gave way to new field that caled geographic data science in which polination could ocur crusade for the benefit of both geography and the data comunity in general to from this new branch whole series of conceptual aproaches adapted to modern times and digitalization geographic data geographic data also known as spatial data describes the location and atributes of objects on earth they can be clasified into absolute defined location by cordinates and relative location based on topological relationships the data geographic areas are comonly represented in the form of maps and are georeferenced in terestrial cordinate systems asociated with spatial reference frame for obtain information and perform analysis adequate data procesing is required which may include statistical analysis and geometric features in adition development of digital transformation model of geographic data can be through information and comunications technologies icts combine both perspectives to achieve complete spatial analysis morea rodriguez huerta rodríguez vilareal et al madrid soto ortiz lópez geographic information systems gis geographic information systems gis are computer systems that capture they store and display data related to the location on the planet surface these systems alow us to understand spatial relationships preserve data and perform analysis combining them with graphical and maping interfaces gis includes both hardware as software and can use cartographic photographic digital and spreadshets national geographic society morea rodríguez huerta rodríguez the combination of knowledge presented in geographic information system and science by longley et al and multicriteria decision analysis in geographic information science by malczewski riner provides comprehensive view of the aplication of gis in geographic data science on the one hand longley and godchild they cover the fundamentals and general aplications of gis such as capture storage and analysis of geographic data as wel as the use of technologies and advanced gis techniques aditionaly they explore the relationship betwen gis and disciplines such as cartography remote sensing and spatial analysis while malczewski and riner they focus on multi criteria decision analysis within the context of gis are combined perspectives ofer solid foundation for understanding and adresing problems complexes in spatial decision making longley et al malczewski riner digital focus on geographic data traditionaly cartographic information is presented in analog form that is representing the reality of ma physical nature and continues however with the advance technological it becomes necesary to adapt this information to digital format in way discretly that is analyticaly morea rodríguez huerta rodríguez for obtain digital cartography it is necesary to continue with two fundamental requirements chapter digital data must be georeferenced in such way that each data geographical location has label that defines its spatial position in reference the spatial characteristics of the geographic data must be described in terms digital through topological relationships aditionaly it is important to encode geographic data using geocoding which acording to morea rodríguez huerta rodríguez can be direct or indirect direct geocoding it consists of determining the absolute spatial location for each geographic data in system of orthogonal cordinate axes the the most used systems are those of plane cordinates for spaces on the earth surface in cartesian plane with two perpendicular axes indirect geocoding it consists of the posibility of geographicaly locating elements from the values of an atribute of an entity such as the adres the postal code the municipality among others this geocoding has huge spectrum of demographic analysis on cartography and data science geographical digital transformation dt delimitation digital transformation is an evolutionary proces that goes beyond the adoption of technologies afecting al aspects of an organization rodríguez abitia bribiesca corea there are diferent interpretations of this concept some se it as an incremental aplication of information technologies heilig et al while others consider it disruptive change driven by inovations cumulative digital data skog et al rodríguez abitia bribiesca corea digital transformation involves changes in proceses organization comercial domain and society parviainen et al it also requires multidimensional aproaches such as the development of digital capabilities gurbaxani dunkle and considerations development of digital transformation model from geographic data to through information and comunications technologies icts specific to the industry and size of the organization demlehner laumer to be sucesful it is important to adres aspects such as organizational culture colaboration digital leadership and workforce capabilities muehlburger et al digital transformation seks to improve organizational performance through simplification of proceses the creation of new services and the inovation of products and services westerman et al in adition it can generate benefits such as improving the quality of the customer services and obtaining competitive advantages davenport fitzgerald et al rajabi bolhari sahu et al westerman bonet in conclusion digital transformation involves profound changes in an organization and its environment and requires clear strategic vision and the integration of digital capabilities to make the most of the oportunities of the digital age figure ilustrates the td area uper left quadrant the two axes show the operational proceses of an organization the vertical axis presents value creation and provision of services and the horizontal axis the services or products ofered by the company the focus is on the transition from conventional to inovative busines models figure digital transformation of an organization operational proceses source adapted from berman bel chapter the key factors for digital transformation projects were described by sandkuhl et al and are strategy leadership products people culture operations governance and technology digitalization is not digital transformation td digitizing involves converting analog information into digital format such as scaning documents or use electronic forms reis et al on the other hand the digitalization uses digital technology to create value in new ways improving the operational eficiency and reducing erors goble examples of digitization can be the cordinate records in excel tables and the colection of cordinates through geospatial readers goble hsu et al without however digitizing does not imply changes in the proces

through information and comunications technologies icts preliminary result of the proces diagnosis prioritized there is no gdb that centralizes the data we work with independent files in local storage in the best of cases the gdbs are located stored on network drives but without documentation versioning or change control excel documents are used for records cordinates in most of the cases are transcribed there are no rules for quality integrity and completenes of data in the records of excel in some cases domains are managed one of the most serious problems of the proces is in the marking of samples since the identifier or registry key is dynamic and depends on the aplication of busines rules of various actors the generation of new products is costly since it is required to validate in several data sources posible updates due to not being available in one single centralized data source there is no data governance technological platform based on the results of the characterization

describes the proposed points to expand the research in future work research results objectives prepare the diagnosis of the curent technological state of the digital transformation of the data from the cartography and geological and geomorphological research group of the colombian geological service sgc to identify the chalenges in the digitization of geographic data this objective was met through the characterization of the proces through the review of literature and the partial aplication of the digital transformation framework for entities public of the mintic for this exercise the available tols were used to measure the digital maturity level and identify and prioritize through the heat map the proceses that demand intervention in terms of digital transformation no however this was an aproximation of the curent technological state and had to be complemented with the evaluation and disagregation of the proceses section frames the proces to performed within the model and section details the result of the objective through the geotd validation this research involved an intervention for geographical data therefore it was necesary to review in detail the key proceses of the case study group through chapter work sesions with the diferent functional areas of the group in order to know the dynamics of proceses inputs and products identify the conceptual and functional components based on icts for the digital transformation of geographic data the fulfilment of this objective is achieved through thre instances the first adresed the conceptual review of icts and the exploration of previous aplication works documented in chapter the second instance involved the identification of the problems in the prioritized proceses in the characterization and the third instance included the selection of apropriate methods and technologies to solve the problems isues it should be noted that the conceptual and functional components based on icts selected in this research are detailed in section however also they are listed in sections and to validate the model in this research the folowing concepts were used icts cloud computing geolocation microservices edge computing however the projects derived from this research especialy for the case study can be framed in the use of machine learning and big data design the digital transformation model for geographic data the design and construction of the digital transformation model for geographic data geo td was based on the dimensions proposed by the mintic in the transformation framework digital for public entities it is model oriented to the user and internal proceses and intermediate organizations geo td seks to enable proceses that use geographic data to evolve transversaly in terms of people and digital culture digital data and analytics digital proceses and iv technology providing the tols to groups and organizations to build solutions based on icts development of digital transformation model of geographic data to through information and comunications technologies icts likewise it contemplates the mintic architecture metamodel which guides the selection and definition of technological components for the design and construction of the platform the design characterization and construction of geo td is detailed in chapter validate the proposed model for the digital transformation of geographic data use case cartography and geological and geomorphological research group of the colombian geological service sgc this objective was met through the aplication of geo td in the cartography group and geological and geomorphological research of the colombian geological service sgc this case study was selected because it brings together potential scenarios for the model validation aditionaly because one belongs to the group and knows the misionality and data used in the group in adition to the objectives and in order to suport the validation of the model it was developed and implemented web oriented technological platform which works under an engine relational database with an architecture based on microservices uses htp protocol to expose services to users and systems of esri and gogle through the use of wlan lan networks and implements internet security certificates sl in that sense this research presents the fulfilment of the stated objectives the code repository and asociated documentation of the technology platform geo td validation can be consulted in the azure link enabled for this purpose research question what methodological and conceptual elements can be incorporated into model to enhance the digital maturity of organizations that generate and use information geographical in their misionary proceses within the framework of digital transformation and considering the slr there are various instruments aimed at enhancing digital maturity at the organizational level however chapter models like geo td bring together and specify the necesary instruments and tols to enhance the digital maturity of organizations that generate and use data geographical in that sense and in the first instance the characterization and calculation tols of the level of digital maturity are valuable instrument to diagnose the technological state and guide ict aplication initiatives in the second instance the implementation of technological platforms and solutions based on ict concepts they concentrate instruments that enhance misional proceses in organizations this research describes in greater detail in chapters and the instruments designed and implemented to validate the geo td model in the case study selected conclusions this research constitutes contribution from geomatics to organizations public and private that involve geographic data in their proceses and lack of elements to undertake digital transformation initiatives in diferent scenarios and levels geo td alows you to consult historical works without wasting efort and resources eliminates the use of email or instant mesaging systems with atached files strengthens certainty in decision making and adjustments or corections are reflected with greater imediacy geo td reduces execution time in prioritized proceses since it has information in services for consultation management analysis and generation of geological and geomorphological products icts have become fundamental element for the transformation digitalization of proceses in organizations however this entails guiding eforts to increase investments in technology and highly human talent trained who can take on the chalenges of digital transformation centralizing geographic data in single system avoids duplication of records and alows beter use of ict resources besides the setings or corections are reflected with greater imediacy geo td represents an alternative solution apropriate to the neds of the case study since it eliminates neck botles use of files development of digital transformation model of geographic data to through information and comunications technologies icts decentralized incorporates elements of geographic data quality through forms with validation in fields and eliminates the transcription of cordinates know first hand the neds of the actors including acompanying field days to understand the scenarios should be fundamental in corect gathering of requirements for the development of system of information that responds to the neds and expectations of the organization which which avoids resistance in its adoption digital transformation models should not focus solely on the adoption of technologies to achieve changes in their proceses there must be organizational culture that fosters encourages and adopts changes at the level technological technology must be understod as an enhancer of proceses and not as threat public servants must be alies of these initiatives and changes and not become an obstacle to its adoption digital transformation must be state policy and not government policy which sugests continuity of the proceses and eforts made despite the ideological and political changes that arise future work it is necesary to introduce validations from quality metrics based on standards iso that evaluate the technological platform and the quality of the gi the functionalities that provide suport must be incorporated into the technological platform to proceses not atended to and that have apeared in the list of proceses prioritized in the heat matrix incorporate machine learning and big data

the level international in the digital transformation proceses of the un headquarters manizales for your development mixed methodology is folowed which is the systematic integration of methods quantitative and qualitative with non experimental methodological aproach of an exploratory type which also combines descriptive aspects and what is intended is to determine the existing best practices to evaluate digital capabilities in educational institutions higher education identify the level of advancement of digital capabilities at the un manizales headquarters and establish the lines of action of the digital transformation for the un manizales headquarters based on the curent state of its digital capabilities this final work is made up of four chapters namely chapter study design the literature is reviewed where the elements are identified found by several authors in order to determine the focus of the study from this review describes the situation found the objectives sought with the study its methodology and scope in chapter digital capabilities and their main frames of reference systematic review of literature on the models or frameworks of international digital capabilities where they were identified and analyzed six studies taking into acount some criteria determined in the review of literature acording to the results of the analysis it is determined that the framework of digital competence digcomp is the study that mets of the criteria analyzed therefore it is selected as the framework to folow in the analysis of the digital capabilities at the manizales headquarters chapter capacity diagnosis introduction digital at the manizales headquarters the design of the instrument is developed from the framework of digcomp competition selected in chapter likewise the research method to folow the instrument is aplied to the selected population in in this case they were students teachers and administrators then the results where the report on the level of advancement of digital capabilities is writen at the headquarters chapter development of the proposal based on the capacity diagnosis headquarters the aspects to improve are identified to

progreses the consequences in al areas of life wil change they propose that in the short term there wil be changes in employment proposals and that acording to study caried out by carlos toxtli entrepreneur and researcher from west virginia university of positions wil be replaced by technology which wil produce progresive unemployment in this sense the ir produces transformations in relation to its sped scope and impact that it can produce in an organization in which many areas wil have to change and rethink which is why it is necesary to transform to survive in this digital transformation is oriented towards this new environment duparc states that true digital transformation is achieved when the entire organization asumes the importance of digital culture and makes it its own at al levels it is not problem of technology but of people and organizational structures adopting new management model arango serna branch castro benavides burgos while westerman asks the question if digital transformation is the solution to emerging busines chalenges in the digital age or whether it is another buzword of marketing however or comes to the conclusion that digital transformation is the use of digital technologies to improve the performance and reach of organizations these new changes that have come with the ir industrial revolution and the transformation digital also afect higher education institutions ies so they wil have the chalenge of promoting learning oportunities that alow inclusion in this new digital era likewise they wil have to rethink the way in which their proceses operate internaly so that it can coexist in balanced way with technologies oriented to ict virtual reality artificial inteligence robotics systems experts augmented reality big data cloud computing the internet of things as wel such as those related to emotional inteligence coaching mindfulnes conscious without forgeting the organizational culture through continuous colaboration fiero santilán the importance of ict skils and digitalization in heis has ben growing in in recent years there are studies focused on digital transformation models and digital capabilities with the purpose of providing tols to evaluate the state in where the institutions are located almaraz menéndez provides framework of reference that breaks down the digital transformation proces in universities and is aplied at the university of salamanca likewise kozina kirinić cary out measurement of digital capabilities in ies in using model of digital capability maturity and the results of the evaluation were aplied in ies on the other hand international standards such as iste redecker and oecd recognize the ned to equip al citizens with the skils necesary to use digital technologies criticaly and creatively bond marín dolch bedenlier zawacki richter governments including the colombian government are responding to oportunities and chalenges posed by the ir with policies and strategies that adres transformation digital in colombia the pace of transformation has ben slow compared to the rest of the world world as evidenced by the los of positions in international indicators such as the electronic government development index from st place in to st in and the digital competitivenes index from th in to th in therefore the government of colombia in its global development plan pact for colombia pact for equity formulates the national digital transformation and inteligence policy artificial which seks to bost productivity and promote the wel being of citizens as wel as generate the transversal enablers for the sectoral digital transformation of so that colombia can take advantage of the oportunities and face the chalenges related to ir the former public policy ist until now speaks of thre limitations to be overcome digital transformation policies have ben more oriented to government in order to make the citizen state relationship more eficient not however although there is progres in the mater it is necesary to acelerate the step to be at the forefront of the most recent developments in the digital government field given the sped of technological change that is experienced the country stil must encourage citizens to knowledge and digital skils necesary to face the changes in economic and social structures brought about by the ir the competitivenes and productivity policies have incorporated technologies digital although not with the relevance and depth that the ri national department of planing dnp the national university of colombia un being state entity acepts the policies proposed by the national government and considers as the main pilar within its institutional strategic project for the global development plan pgd digital transformation to create culture that transforms learning and goes from hand in hand with new technologies national university of colombia the vision of this pilar is until the year the general objective is to promote in the university comunity tuned to inovation through digital transformation where the advancement of technology and emerging trends maximize colaboration active learning research and creation arango serna et al indicate that to begin the transformation proces in the university it is necesary to evaluate the curent capabilities as wel as obstacles or dificulties that could prevent achievement of the transformation at the manizales headquarters before the higher university council on december the headquarters management team proposes the action plan caled program to through which in one of the chapters he exposes the curent situation and the diagnosis of the headquarters and include the projection of the organizational structure where they show certain dificulty in the development of administrative proceses that link several dependencies this aspect afects the organizational climate and does not alow the university be more agile and eficient national university of colombia as an alternative solution to this condition various posibilities arise to rethink the university considering as management principle of best practices seking maintain competitive advantage national university of colombia the headquarters directives view digital transformation as an oportunity for university because it wil alow you to inovate in proceses under an organizational culture of change and aims as fundamental element to establish the curent state of the organization as wel as the way how the people involved interact development of university work national university of colombia acording to what is established in the various studies consulted and public policy existing in colombia which mentions the limitations to be overcome in the case of this study is limitation which relates to promoting knowledge and skils digital citizenship national planing department dnp as wel as the ned for the university to know the curent capabilities to begin the digital transformation proces at the un and the ned for the headquarters to know the status curent situation in relation to digital transformation it is identified that it is esential to incorporate that digital transformation digital capabilities in this sense the folowing question arises how to incorporate capacity models internationaly recognized in the digital transformation proceses of the national university of colombia manizales campus likewise the folowing questions arise how to determine existing best practices for asesing capabilities digital in an hei how to identify the level of advancement of digital capabilities at un headquarters manizales how to establish the lines of action of the digital transformation for the un headquarters manizales from the curent state of its digital capabilities justification acording to what was stated in the situation found the directives of the manizales headquarters have raised in their action plan for the isue of digital transformation for start with the organizational change and intend as fundamental element to establish the curent state of the organization as wel as the way people interact that intervene in the development of university work acording to studies consulted the digital transformation and artificial inteligence policy aproved by the national government it is standard to be met by state entities coupled with the ned for the un in know the curent capabilities in adition to the directives of the headquarters in their intention by knowing the curent state in relation to digital transformation the oportunity to incorporate existing international digital capability models in the digital transformation proceses of the un headquarters manizales and from there have the tols to indicate the level of progres of the curent state of the headquarters in relation to digital capabilities and generate proposal that indicates the lines of action for the digital transformation at the manizales headquarters based on the curent state of capabilities digital this project wil be tol for decision making at headquarters and step towards compliance with the digital transformation and artificial inteligence policy proposed by the national government theoretical framework and related works the world has had to live various transformations related to industry and technology in each one changes were made in the energy sources proceses and industrial activities the means of comunication and transportation which has alowed great social transformations the first industrial revolution can be traced back to with the invention of the railway and the invention of the steam engine and marked the begining of production mechanics the second industrial revolution began in the mid th century characterized by the mechanical and metalurgical industry and made mas production posible fostered by the advent of electricity and the asembly line third industrial revolution began in the it is known as the digital revolution or the computer because it was catalyzed by personal computing and and the internet schwab and the fourth industrial revolution ir begins starting in the th century characterized by the masive adoption of digital technologies such as internet smart mobile phones along with the growth of computing and storage capacity acording to gonz there are thre transformations derived from the combination of the technological advances first consumer behavior second the iruption of technology characterized by the exploitation of data artificial inteligence and development of new infrastructure and the third the emergence of new models of busines that arise from the digital world the digital transformation has generated interest in research academia and busines some authors who have ben interested in the subject have their own concept such as as can be sen in table which lists various definitions of digital transformation compiled by the authors

technology from diferent points of view these changes that have come with the ir it also afects higher education institutions ies so they wil have the chalenge to promote learning oportunities that alow inclusion in this new era digital fiero santilán acording to the magazine iberciencia comunity of educators for science they indicate that as this stage progreses the consequences in al areas of life wil change they propose that in the short term there wil be changes in employment proposals and that acording to study caried out by carlos toxtli entrepreneur and researcher from west virginia university of positions wil be replaced by technology which wil produce progresive unemployment digital transformation in education institutions superior given the importance of digital transformation in higher education institutions below is literature review on digital transformation in higher education institutions ies in order to know the level of maturity in the which institutions are on this isue international context at the university of oldenburg in germany they caried out study where they interviewed students and teachers in order to know the perception of the students and teachers about the use of digital media the findings indicated that both students as teachers they use limited number of digital technology for activities related to the asimilation of learning and sugest suporting the broad use of technology for teaching and learning purposes bond et al on the other hand in report caried out in by the digital education organization of the kingdom kingdom through which more than students from organizations were surveyed of the united kingdom and international organizations it was concluded that the ful benefits of technology to suport learning have not yet ben realized and technology is more comonly used for convenience than for teaching more efective newman betham in spain study was caried out to identify the use of technology by teachers being interested both in the frequency and in the use of it as wel as in the type of learning activities in which they use for which profesors from universities were interviewed public ades and private sector in andalusia and the results revealed por integration of technologies in teaching learning proceses also indicated that the change in teachers it is not produced only by puting teachers in contact with technologies and technologies alone do not change learning proceses is required intense intervention in which technologies suport the proces of apropriation of knowledge by students through productive learning and comunicative experiences marcelo yot mayor digital transformation models thre important models were identified with the systematic review of literature that were developed mainly in digital transformation in educational institutions higher such models include digital capability and it capability as elements imersed in digital transformation in spain in the doctoral thesis developed by fernando enrique almaraz menéndez talks about the implications of the digital transformation proces in the institutions of higher education the study was caried out mainly for the

leadership for digital transformation projects taking into acount the entire comunity university colombian context in colombia several studies have ben caried out in order to know the maturity index of organizations regarding digital transformation one of these studies was prepared by cintel company of inovative it projects where the first measurement was developed in and in order to identify the progres of the organizations the result shows growth in the global maturity index of digital transformation of going from points in to points in in this study they included the educational sector and the conclusions indicated that the increase in the use of technology such as data analytics shows the ned of organizations to have procesed structured and organized information for decision making in the same way without ignoring the apropriation of technology by organizations as wel as the management of technological change the misuse of technology and the fear of organizing it on the part of colaborators are identified as the main obstacles to the implementation of technological solutions in the organization cintel inovative it projects likewise the national asociation of businesmen of colombia andi developed digital transformation survey in in which it indicates that of entrepreneurs are adopting new busines models and are aware of the ir of the total businesmen expresed themselves positively with very high percentages similar betwen the industrial sector and the services sector on the other hand the proces is much faster in service companies than in industry in acording to the businesmen surveyed the main areas with greatest impact digitaly transformed in the next two years are inovation in products and services the customer relations area the internal and organizational proceses and the area of new busines models and income streams in adition to this the main chalenges faced today by companies to achieve sucesful digital transformation are in their order lack of culture ignorance and budget andi the main obstacle that these surveys show in the implementation of sucesful digital transformation is the organizational culture the misuse of technologies and the fear of using them of the institutions colaborators the government of colombia in its global development plan pact for colombia pact for equity formulates the national digital transformation and inteligence policy artificial which seks to bost productivity and promote the wel being of citizens as wel as generate the transversal enablers for the sectoral digital transformation of so that colombia can take advantage of the oportunities and face the chalenges related to the fourth industrial revolution ir national department of dnp planing the public policy existing until now has thre limitations that must be overcome digital transformation policies have ben more oriented to government in order to make the citizen state relationship more eficient not however although there is progres in the mater it is necesary to acelerate the step to be at the forefront of the most recent developments in the digital government field given the sped of technological change that is being experienced the country must stil promote knowledge and skils among citizens digital technologies necesary to face the changes in the structures economic and social that the ir brings competitivenes and productivity policies have incorporated the digital technologies although not with the relevance and depth required the ir the national university of colombia un acepts the policies proposed by the ministry of ict and considers it as the main pilar within its strategic project institutional for the global development plan pgd digital transformation to create culture that transforms learning and goes hand in hand with the new technologies national university of colombia the vision of this pilar is up to the year the general objective is to foster comunity atuned at the university with

scope the scope of this final master thesis wil be limited by the folowing aspects existing best practices for asesing digital capabilities are focused on higher education institutions the level of advancement of digital capabilities wil be identified at the un manizales headquarters the lines of action for digital transformation based on digital capabilities they wil be established for the un headquarters manizales methodology for the development of the final master thesis mixed methodology is folowed which is the systematic integration of quantitative and qualitative methods in single study with the in order to obtain more complete photograph of the phenomenon sampieri hernández roberto colado fernández carlos likewise methodological aproach is folowed experimental exploratory type acording to what sampieri points out exploratory studies are caried out when the objective is to examine topic or litle studied research problem about which there are many doubts or not has ben adresed before that is when the review of the literature revealed that there are only unresearched guides and ideas vaguely related to the problem of study or if we want to investigate topics and areas from new perspectives this exploratory study wil also combine descriptive aspects since the studies descriptives aim to measure or colect information independently or jointly about the concepts or variables to which they refer that is their objective is not to indicate how these are related sampieri hernández roberto colado fernández carlos the methodology is integrated into thre stages table methodology stage objectives activities stage objective determine the systematic review of elaboration of existing best practices for literature on best state of the art and evaluate practical digital capabilities to evaluate theoretical framework in education institutions digital capabilities in heis superior review and categorization of the variables found best practices stage objective

digital capabilities and their main frames of reference systematic review of literature on beter practices to evaluate digital capabilities in heis methodology the systematic literature review rsl methodology proposed by kitchenham which consists of presenting an evaluation of research topic through the use of reliable rigorous and auditable methodology the proces of search as can be sen in figure consists of phases planing the review development of the review and publication of results figure systematic literature review proces review planing identification of the ned for review development of review protocol development of the review research identification selection of primary studies evaluation of study quality data extraction and tracking data synthesis publication of results write review report source prepared from kitchenham the adaptation of the methodology of the phases presented in figure systematic literature review proces review planing at this stage the planing of the systematic review is caried out and reference is taken guide kitchenham researchers must sumarize al existing information about some phenomenon in an exhaustive and impartial maner in order to establish general conclusions that individual studies or as begining of activities of future research identification of the ned for review this identification establishes the objective of the review the questions of research and what resources are available to cary it out the objective of the review is to cary out systematic literature search in order to determine existing best practices for asesing digital capabilities in higher education institutions the specification of the research questions is the paradigm by which studies and clasifies bibliographic material therefore what is sought to be established is what folowing what is meant by digital capabilities how to determine existing best practices for asesing capabilities digital in an hei how many studies have ben published in recent years on best practices of digital capabilities in heis what are the existing models and methodologies to evaluate the capabilities digital in higher education institutions which studies have ben validated in institutions higher education development of the search protocol guz and rushchitsky and aghaei chadegani et al establish that the bases of most widespread data in the scientific field and widely used in searches for literature are scopus and web of science hence they have ben selected as the bases of data to be used in the development of the systematic literature review however and given the relevance that gogle scholar has taken on in recent years it was decided incorporate it into the study as complement to the search proces as part of the search strategy the folowing search string was adopted to scopus and web of science databases digital competence or digital literacy or digital inclusion and model or methodology or strategy or evaluation or maturity model and higher education or university to cary out the search within the databases the title sumary and keywords as strategy to improve the precision of information search spante hashemi lundin algers likewise no temporal restriction and its search was restricted to articles and reviews in spanish language and english the search is delimited by defining publication interval in this case betwen to in order to identify what have ben the most recent practices in relation with digital capabilities and coroborate what has ben the curent view on the isue of investigation when searching for information without any time restriction it was noted that some terms were confused with other branches such as medicine and enginering and in second the search for the query was caried out with the restriction of the field of life sciences computing and busines development of the review research identification once the search protocol has ben aplied figure shows the phases of the search review of the documentation found articles are identified among the databases main data scopus web of science and gogle scholar publish software is used or perish and the consultation was caried out in november figure review phases source own elaboration based on scopus web of science and gogle scholar selection of primary studies for the manual selection of publications first filter is made where documents they were excluded because they were duplicated that is they were in more than two bases of data the same article subsequently an initial review of the topic is caried out in general and articles are excluded because they are related to primary basic education or secondary schol were in specific area such as health or were related to specific tols such as blogs wiki etc with selected publications are included the title and sumary of the article is reviewed and exclude documents they had to do with specific areas such as history science social nursing archaeology bachelor degres with software promotion specific or digital platforms with teaching in older adults with models specific learning objectives that are not related to the study likewise it excludes document because it was not available items included relevant ones that were searched through gogle and selected from various pages of research journals on digital models and capabilities in educational institutions higher education in colombia in which the national university of colombia in total publications were evaluated for the research study quality asesment once the relevant studies have ben selected based on the analysis of the title and abstract manual asesment is caried out using tols such as mendely and excel the articles studied were clasified acording to the number of citations that each presents article in scopus and web of science finaly we proced to evaluate the studies trying to answer the research questions the categories were the folowing evaluation digital capabilities digital literacy strategy model capacity digital digital literacy digital competence framework methodology and also includes systematic review of literature in relation to definitions of competence digital data extraction and tracking as can be sen in figure it is found that the vast majority of articles were asesments of digital competence or digital literacy aplied to students and teachers in heis where some specific dimensions were analyzed while strategies of articles refer to certain tactics used by some heis whether they are instruments or software to determine their digital capabilities in the review articles related to systematic literature review were detected of articles through which concepts of digital capabilities are determined digital literacy digital skils taking into acount that the object of this study is to find the best practices to evaluate digital capabilities in an hei priority wil be given to documents related to the competence framework categories digital model and methodology of articles that mostly mention some models in general that are used internationaly figure categorization of publications percentage of publications revision strategies systematic literature model methodology frame competence digital asesment without time restriction in the selection phase figure shows that we talk about digital skils since however it began to have importance from the year lindroth bergquist and it is from of that the number of publications on best practices of digital capabilities grow with being the year that stands out figure distribution of articles in the period betwen and twenty one twenty fiften eleven eleven figure indicates the countries that stand out on the topic and show certain emphasis on the use of best practices of digital competence or digital literacy in spain united kingdom the united states and china it can be sen that colombia has entered also on the topic figure distribution of articles by country results conceptualization of digital competence and digital literacy to begin with the main foundation of this work search is caried out for the major studies in the area and outlines the terms of competence literacy or digital skils that these concepts are often used synonymously although have diferent meanings martin grudziecki therefore it is necesary to give conceptual clarity of these terms digital competence is about skils esential for life they are even conceived as survival skils in the era digital eshet alkalai or vital asets in the information society van deursen dijk ala mutka points out competence as the ability to aply knowledge and skils in diferent contexts such as work leisure or learning ala mutka acording to deursen literacy refers to certain competencies and knowledge while skils refer to the more technical aspects of these skils and knowledge iordache mariën baelden agre with alka mutka by indicating that digital competence is discused as the ability to aply these knowledge and skils to various contexts of life from personal to profesional to do this digital literacy colects the awarenes practical skils and competencies necesary to for users to aces understand evaluate comunicate with others and create digital content in strategic and aplied way iordache mariën baelden acording to ferari he defines digital competence as the set of knowledge skils atitudes including abilities strategies values and awarenes that are required when using the ict and digital media to cary out tasks solve problems comunicate manage information to colaborate create and share content and build knowledge in an efective eficient apropriate critical creative autonomous flexible ethical and reflective for work leisure participation learning socialization consumption and empowerment in this same sense laraz understands digital competence as the some of literacies technological or computer informational audiovisual or media and comunicative to participate in safe ethical and civic way of digital identity in general it can be sen how the various authors perceive digital competence as set of esential life skils and their aplication and digital literacy is the compilation of these skils and knowledge such as technological comunicative informational audiovisual and skils are understod as something more technical than those skils and knowledge based on the review of concepts from diferent authors this project asumes the concept of digital competence by iordache mariën baelden and ferari as the set of knowledge skils and atitudes that are neded when use ict and digital media and the ability to aply them in various contexts of the life from personal to profesional thus after the clarification of the concepts of digital competence and digital literacy that was explained above review and comparison of the best practices converted into models and frameworks of digital competence review and evaluation of digital competence best practices in the bibliographic review it was posible to find series of studies related to standards frameworks and models of competencies or digital literacy eight of them with relevance at the international level and one at the national level aplied to an hei to cary out the content analysis of each of the studies the folowing are defined selection criteria the number of references in other studies and recognized in the literature specialized they had to be relevant to the discusion of digital competence or literacy around the analysis of digital skils and competencies found included in the selected models and frameworks the studies could be aplied in higher education institutions therefore for this reason some of them are focused on teaching while others are aplicable to any type of institutions its structure was built as frame with clasification of skils knowledge and competencies your publication had to cover the last years betwen and respectively although one of the selected frames is from due to number of citations and its relevance in the specialized literature was taken into acount to have comparison with the other selected studies based on this review it was decided to exclude thre studies and select six the excluded studies were the folowing icdl international computer digital literacy standard icdl is an organization international which has knowledge certification program computing this standard measures person ability to handle computer drive to basic it concepts despite being an international standard is not included because its structure only includes basic knowledge of computing is not constructed as framework which is required for analysis model for the development and acreditation of digital competence at the university virginia laraz rada it is model created at the university of andora its objective is to develop and acredit the competence of students it is model litle recognized by specialized literature and unclear in its content nets standard it is standard developed by the international society for technology in education iste standards is recognized worldwide international as standard for teaching and focused on learning without however for the development of this work and when reviewing the other studies where thre of them focus on teaching and can be implemented in other setings it was decided not to include the nets standard in the evaluation the six studies mentioned below were selected acording to to the criteria as relevant study the unesco framework of ict competencies of teachers ict cft as tol to guide the initial and ongoing training of teachers on the use of ict throughout the educational system it is an international framework which has had several versions and now this instrument is designed to adapt to national and institutional objectives providing an updated framework for the policy making and capacity building in this dynamic area unesco the framework is organized into thre stages or sucesive levels of development of the teachers regarding the pedagogical use of ict acquisition of knowledge depening of knowledge knowledge creation in turn the framework consists of competencies organized around the six aspects of the profesional practice of teachers at thre levels of pedagogical use of the ict by teachers the underlying idea is that teachers who have competencies to use ict in their profesional practice wil provide quality education and in ultimately they wil be able to efectively guide the development of the competencies of the students in ict maters the six aspects of teachers profesional practice are as folows understanding the role of ict in educational policies curiculum and evaluation pedagogy aplication of digital skils organization and administration and profesional learning of teachers the iskils model developed by educational testing service ets is another of selected studies is an outcomes based framework that measures the ability to think criticaly in digital environment ets is an international institution which is recognized for its ectory in the development of acreditation for both students like the citizen establishes digital literacy framework caled digital transformation framework for ict literacy in its definition of literacy in ict identify five components that they consider esential and that represent continum of skils and knowledge for functioning in society of knowledge each of the components is defined by ets as folows aces know and know how to colect and or retrieve information manage aply an existing organizational or clasification scheme integrate interpret and represent information it involves sumarizing comparing and to contrast evaluate make judgments about the quality relevance usefulnes or eficiency of the information create generate information by adapting aplying designing inventing or creating information another of the selected studies developed by the european comision ipts dg eac digcomp anusca ferari punie bre which creates the project to develop digital competence framework that emerges from frameworks and the contribution of experts has ben reference in most studies because it is framework aplied in diferent contexts and is used to guide the identification of limited set of indicators in order to measure digital competition betwen countries it includes competencies organized in five dimensions this framework of competition has several updates the original version was created in the by ferari in the digcomp version is published vuorikari punie caretero van den brande in which they update their terminology the model conceptual and show some examples of its aplication at the european level national and regional information and digital literacy browsing searching and filtering information evaluation of information storage and retrieval of information online comunication and colaboration interaction through technologies share information and content participate in online citizenship colaborating through digital chanels netiquete identity management digital creation of digital content content development integration and reworking copyright and licenses programing security protection of devices protection of personal data health protection environmental protection problem solving resolution of technical problems identification of technological neds and responses inovate and use technology in way creative identification of digital competence gaps for the purposes of model analysis digcomp version wil be used similarly the proposed digital skils measurement model is selected by deursen van dijk in which it is stated that the digital and the social are related by similar types of fields economic cultural social and personal the authors propose set of skils on the internet because they consider them to be key part of digital inclusion the aproach has led to search for instruments that are capable of measuring what abilities people have people how they relate to certain types of participation and how these can subsequently afect specific aspects of daily life this model was aplied in holand with sample of people and response was obtained from people the model proposes four sets of skils to navigate the internet operational skils to navigate the internet formal skils to navigate the internet internet navigation skils related to content and information strategic skils to navigate the internet another of the selected studies was developed by kozina kirinić in slovenia in which measurement of digital capabilities is caried out in heis in the year using digital capability maturity model dcm the results of the evaluation were colected within the higher education institution and were they mainly refer to proces inovations that digitize education higher education and the implementation of educational technology as wel as the digitization of services to suport the proceses of teaching learning evaluation and digitization of it services to suport the other proceses of the institution busines transformation management includes disciplines strategy management value management risk management program and project management skils management and training busines proces management management of organizational change transformational it management metamanagement at the national level the experimental theoretical model proposed by melo solarte díaz vega serna which was caried out at the university of manizales and whose purpose was to characterize and evaluate technological competencies that the diferent actors who are part of an academic comunity have university to create the model they use the clasification of competencies proposed by unesco in but they expanded the spectrum to al actors in university comunity teachers students and administrative in adition focusing the analysis on the apropriation and use technological within the role that each one plays they use the five dimensions raised by unesco technological informational pedagogical comunicational axiological and aditionaly propose sixth dimension in productive order that determines the use of ict in the training proces or in their daily activities in adition they ad another dimension of productive order with which they intend to identify the importance that technologies have both in the training proces of people and in their daily activities evaluation of digital competence frameworks or models to evaluate the frameworks and models quick scan analysis is performed as it describes multiple smal case studies based on limited set of variables by maping the variables and their indices into single aray it becomes posible to analysis of similarities diferences and variances betwen the cases audenhove baelden mariën this is how the digital skils and competencies found are analyzed for each of the models and frameworks matrix is created with the competencies similarities that were found in each of the studies clasifying them into five categories operations for the use of ict information and knowledge digital comunication creation of digital content strategic competencies likewise each of these categories contains its criteria that in total aded up twenty one which have ben maped using matrix as can be sen observe in table for each of the studies in such way that it could be identified the similarities or diferences betwen them and determine which of them could be evaluated in complete digital competencies in an hei this comparison is made through visual analysis and review of the literature therefore it was not an analysis statistical even though there are numerical results in the matrix for the development of the matrix the cases that are the models and frameworks are maped into columns

analyzed it is shown that four of its six criteria are the basis in the most of the studies from the oldest to the most curent such as knowing and use software know and use hardware know and use the internet and manage structures digital media that is related to the management of the same digital media such as hyperlinks menus and navigation regarding privacy and protection of information they are found in the studies digcom melo solarte unesco which is topic that today is relevant to the isue of the procesing of personal data regarding the security of devices has only ben identified by the digcomp competency framework the which highlights the importance of protecting the devices and understand the risks and online threats to know the security measures information and knowledge competencies the second category se table focuses on the ability to understand evaluate and have judgment regarding information in this sense the six studies evaluated coincide in the importance of having criteria for analysis and evaluation of information in such way that judgment can be made about the quality usefulnes and efectivenes of the same information of likewise al studies agre with the information literacy criterion which consists of the ability to search identify select locate aces recover store diseminate and share information these actions are those that take users when trying to satisfy information neds deursen van dijk in relation to the criterion digital problem solving skils it is discused by the vast majority of models and frameworks analyzed there are authors who consider the resolution of problems in their areas of competence and define it as the ability to identify digital neds and resources make informed decisions about tols most apropriate digital technologies acording to the purpose or ned solve conceptual problems through digital media creatively use technologies solve problems technicians update one own and other competence vuorikari et al acording to the criterion suport for others in the development of digital competence it is not indicated explicitly in the studies however thre of them mention colaborative work as one of its items to evaluate in this case suport groups are important to skil development the competency framework proposed by unesco being model designed for teachers indicates that it is necesary to use digital tols flexibly to facilitate colaborative learning manage students and other parties involved in learning and manage the learning proces unesco research has shown that users often rely on various suport groups to develop skils and competencies outside the schol environment formal education hobs digital comunication skils the third category se table is related to comunication skils digital when reviewing the models and macros it is highlighted that in the vast majority there are much of the criteria such as constructing and understanding mesages and interacting online some authors se the importance of comunication because it distributes and manages to understand the apropriate ways to comunicate through digital media to refer to diferent comunication formats to adapt the modes and strategies of comunication in specific audience interact and colaborate online vuorikari et al likewise participation in online networks and comunities was mentioned in five studies except for kozina kirinić regarding the criterion manage an identity digital was mentioned in very few studies vorikari et al mention it as one of the criteria in relation to comunication and indicates that creating adapting and managing one or more digital identities is important to be able to protect one reputation and proces data that ocurs acros multiple acounts and aplications with respect to general behavior on the internet just like the previous criterion is mentioned by four of the studies indicate that it must be learned in practice since there is no guide formal available deursen van dijk and they emphasize the importance of ensuring the corection of behavior and actions when interacting with other people online unesco digital content creation skils the fourth category consists of digital content creation skils se table the criteria create and edit new content build new knowledge and produce creative expresions in the vast majority of models and macros they consider it as way to inovate generate information by adapting aplying designing inventing educational testing service ets both criteria go hand in hand with integrate and mixing existing content is relevant element in the development of digital skils and regarding the criterion knowledge and management of the rights of intelectual property ipr and licensing has ben discused in thre of the studies for both respect for property rights are valued hence the users should not only know the rules about using existing work but they must also be able to understand the diferent types of licenses and aply them corectly to their own digital production vuorikari et al strategic competencies in the fifth category speaks of strategic competencies se table the vast majority of studies include the criterion of using the information towards personal goals or profesionals some indicate that strategic competencies are management skils more advanced internet technologies and afirm that it is necesary for them to be linked to decision making decisions and notions of empowerment deursen van dijk as for the criterion identify digital competence gaps thre studies discus this topic and melo solarte refers to the fact that every institution must have technological management that determines the viability of the acquisition of technologies besides must have apropriation strategies to reduce gaps and beter achieve utilization of the investment from the previous table it can be sen in table that the models with compliance greater than of the twenty one criteria evaluated in the five identified categories were digcomp digital competency framework version vuorikari et al unesco ict teacher competency framework version measurement model of the digital situation in ies melo solarte et al the model with the lowest percentage of compliance in the evaluated criteria coresponds to digital capability maturity model in heis dcm kozina kirinić table compliance of models with the evaluated criteria model of

capacity diagnosis digital at the manizales headquarters the objective of this stage of the study is to identify the level of progres of digital capabilities at un headquarters manizales to achieve this objective in first an instrument is designed based on the digital competence framework selected in the previous chapter in this case digcomp and later it is aplicable to the university comunity of the manizales campus once the aplication has ben made the data colected is tabulated and analyzed indicating the reliability of the instrument and finaly the conclusions are made about the level of advancement of the capabilities digital at the un headquarters manizales instrument design in the previous chapter systematic literature review is caried out to determine the best practices to evaluate digital capabilities in heis review is caried out and categorization of the variables found from six models or competency frameworks digital and acording to the evaluation it is concluded that the reference model to be developed for fulfiling of the competencies and variables analyzed is the framework of digital competence digcomp vuorikari et al and from this framework of competition the instrument is built the purpose of the instrument is to identify the digital capabilities of the comunity university of the un headquarters manizales to met this objective the gqm goal question metric aproach which is used to define adjust and evaluate group of objectives that project or an organization requires and that can be measured to through gqm objectives are refined into questions and metrics are defined that provide the information necesary to answer these questions basili caldiera rombach the resulting definition model consists of thre levels the conceptual level goal it refers to the objectives an objective is defined to an object for variety of reasons with respect to various models of quality from various points of view in relation to particular environment the objects of measure can be products proceses or resources caldiera rombach for in the case of this study the objects wil be the areas of competences defined from of the digcomp reference framework anuska ferari the objects are sumarized as folows object etive information and information literacy articulating neds information locate and recover digital data information and content judge the

chosen and used for this study coresponds to the model descriptive with probabilistic sampling that contains the random sampling segment stratified quantitative research wil be aplied in order to identify the level of advancement of digital capabilities at un headquarters manizales now from the point from an investigative point of view various authors propose that observation stimulates curiosity promotes the development of new facts that may be of scientific interest stimulates problem statement and coresponding hypothesis so observation can be used with the suport of other procedures or techniques the survey the interview among others alowing comparison of the results obtained by diferent means which are completed and alow achieving greater precision in the information colected it is worth mentioning that descriptive research unlike research exploratory is formal and structured so the results wil be considered as input information for the decision making proces and final recomendations this study is caried out with representative sample of the population to be studied and the data wil be analyzed quantitatively therefore this study employs an aproach quantitative which consists of the integration of the quantitative method based on the elements that make up the research firstly it uses descriptive research to systematicaly represent the characteristics of situation or area of interest specific in which case the survey alows identifying the level of progres of the representative sample is available when the main characteristics of the population under study poe are present in proportion in the sample the proportion can be extracted comparably from the number of categories of the variable or in proportion equivalent to how they are

information and digital content storage and recovery of information data and digital content in the previous table it was identified in the first index that al roles without exception have basic knowledge regarding navigation search and filtering of data information and digital content being at basic level however regular teachers and graduate students with significant percentage tend to show abilities above the basic level and are at an intermediate level which indicates that they have the ability to locate information and digital resources in diferent formats in adition to expresing the neds they require in search engines and databases of specialized data for undergraduate students it is important to strengthen the data search and filtering capabilities since only are found in uper level regarding index it can be sen in figure how al the roles are found in intermediate level which denotes that they have the ability to compare and evaluate diferent sources of information data and digital content found on the internet it also shows that teachers are at level above the basic level intermediate level and advanced level this shows that they have the capacity to evaluate information and digital content in their activities teaching ades so likewise it can be sen that administrators contractors students of undergraduate and graduate students are at basic level this it means that they know that not al the information on the internet is reliable but they ned to have the ability to compare and have judgment when evaluating information figure index evaluation of data information and digital content ja and administrative of contractors staf teachers students of students of undergraduate postgraduate plant roles basic intermediate advanced figure shows how al the roles are located at an intermediate level which demonstrates the ability they have to save label files content and information in adition to knowing how to recover and manage information from the contents that have saved likewise contractors advanced and intermediate undergraduate students advanced and intermediate graduate students advanced and intermediate have significant percentage at the

digital netiquete management nar of the digital identity for the first index the previous table shows that both the administrative contractors teachers undergraduate students and graduate students they have the ease of interacting through digital technologies through comunication tols comunication such as chat instant mesaging services or email being at an advanced level very few are at basic level although figure indicates that administrators contractors teachers and students of undergraduate and graduate degres are at an intermediate level where it is denoted that they have the ability to share files and content via emails or other digital media there is trend in administrative teachers undergraduate and graduate students to decrease active participation at the advanced level that is sharing your knowledge content and resources to through online comunities networks and colaboration platforms while contractors have greater participation in sharing their knowledge figure information and content sharing index administrative of contractors staf teachers students of students of undergraduate postgraduate plant basic intermediate advanced when mentioning citizen participation se figure it is sen that both administrators contractors teachers undergraduate and graduate students are at level betwen intermediate and advanced which reflects the ability they have to aces actively to series of specific networks and comunities for diferent purposes furthermore those who are at an advanced level have the ability to participate and expres their opinions in diferent virtual spaces however there is percentage of undergraduate students graduate students teachers contractors and administrative workers who make pasive or no use in terms of participation of online services and networks figure online citizen participation index undergraduate students graduate students regular teachers contractors plant administrators advanced intermediate basic regarding the colaboration index through digital chanels figure shows how undergraduate students graduate students and contractors are regular users in profesional development networks and have the ability to propose diferent digital tols and technologies for colaborative proceses placing itself at an advanced level on the other hand although teachers and administrative staf make les use of profesional development networks they have the ability to select routine wel defined tols and technologies to colaborative proceses taking into acount their own neds and are located at level intermediate however of teachers colaborate in way basic through traditional technologies such as email when analyzing the age of teachers se figure it is identified that they are older than years this sugests that age influences the way people colaborate through digital chanels figure colaboration index through digital chanels administrative of contractors staf teachers students of students of undergraduate postgraduate plant basic intermediate advanced figure results by age of teachers in the colaboration index through chanels digital fifty twenty basic intermediate advanced to years to years to years more than years it is highlighted that al the participating roles in the study se figure are in higher than basic level therefore they have the skils to comunicate digitaly and respecting the rules of conduct they are aware and respectful of diversity cultural in the field of digital comunication aditionaly it is highlighted that the teachers have developed strategies in order to identify behaviors inadequate on the network being at an advanced level figure netiquete index administrative of contractors staf teachers students of students of undergraduate postgraduate plant basic intermediate advanced regarding the digital identity management index se figure al roles respondents know how to create their own digital identity and protect themselves acording to the context and environment it is sen to be at an intermediate level figure digital identity management index undergraduate students graduate students regular teachers contractors plant administrators advanced intermediate basic creation and digital content area regarding the area of creation and digital content thre indices were evaluated mainly which are referenced in the folowing table table results by role creation area and digital content indexes administrative contractors teaching students students plant level postgraduate undergraduate plant comp index development of contents gave gitals integration and reworking of contents digital rights of author and licenses when analyzing the first index of this area it is sen how al roles have the capacity to produce digital content in diferent formats such as text documents presentations multimedia image design and even multimedia in adition aces through mobile devices or tablets and are located at an intermediate level se figure taking into acount that this capacity facilitates the development of activities in the clasrom the results show about of teachers and of undergraduate students they are at basic level this denotes that they search create edit content digital in simple and easy way therefore it would be important to strengthen the capabilities to give greater projection in academic activities figure digital content development index administrative of contractors staf teachers students of students of undergraduate postgraduate plant basic intermediate advanced regarding the integration and reworking of digital content it can be sen in figure which like the previous index agres that al roles are at level intermediate they have the ability to edit and improve content that others or themselves have produced on the other hand of undergraduate students make basic changes of content figure integration and reworking of digital content index administrative of contractors staf teachers students of students of undergraduate postgraduate plant basic intermediate advanced acording to the previous results where the majority of respondents make use of digital technology for the creation of content it is observed in figure that the staf administrators contractors staf teachers students graduate students and undergraduate students know the diferences betwen licenses and sometimes they verify the type so as not to infringe copyright by locating themselves at an intermediate level on the other hand there is significant percentage of students from undergraduate graduate students faculty contractors and plant administrators who understand that some content may have copyright and despite this they use them without having any type of verification for this they are at basic level figure copyright and license index study before undergraduate graduate students staf teachers contractors plant administrators advanced intermediate basic security area for the security area table lists the indices that were evaluated and the results by roles table results by role security area indices administrative contractors teaching students students undergraduate graduate plant level index comp protection of devices

index comp protection of around the previous table shows the security area in its diferent indices that respondents are at an intermediate or advanced level in the first index they have the ability to protect digital devices and update security strategies through the antivirus or use of paswords to reduce the risk of threats it stands out that large part of administrators contractors teachers and undergraduate students know how to act when the device is threatened and there is percentage of administrators and teachers who use basic antivirus in relation to the protection of personal data and digital identity se figure al roles know how to protect their online privacy and that of others using security systems protection such as paswords privileges aces control and are located at level intermediate on the other hand stands out as administrative and contractors aditionaly they change the default privacy of the services devices online to improve security and are at an advanced level very few found at basic level figure personal data protection and digital identity index undergraduate students graduate students staf teachers contractors plant administrators advanced intermediate basic figure shows how al the roles are located at an intermediate and advanced level this means that they have the ability to understand the health risks asociated with use of technologies taking into acount the aspects ergonomics to adiction to technologies however percentage of administrators contractors teachers graduate students and undergraduate students understand that technology can afect your health and yet no action is taken in relation to it their use is therefore at basic level figure health and wel being protection index twenty administrative of contractors staf teachers students of students of undergraduate postgraduate plant basic intermediate advanced survey participants understand the positive and negative aspects of using the technology over the environment they have habit of closing their aplications once they use the mobile device and sometimes verify that the router is out of the way of their workplace this is demonstrated in figure where al the roles were located at an intermediate advanced level however percentage of administrators contractors teachers graduate students and undergraduate students undergraduates are at the basic level and this shows that they do not take action in relation to the use of technology on the environment figure environmental protection index fifty twenty one twenty administrative of contractors staf teachers students of students of undergraduate postgraduate plant basic intermediate advanced problem solving area in the area of problem solving thre indices related to technical problems identification of neds and technological responses and inovation and use of technology creatively se folowing table it can be sen how in the thre indices of al roles the highest percentage is at an intermediate level table results by role problem solving area indices administrative contractors teaching students students plant plant graduate undergraduate level index comp resolution of technical problems identification of neds and technological responses inovation and use of digital technology creative form when asking participants about solving technical problems figure shows the vast majority of roles are interested in seking to solve problems non complex techniques related to comon digital devices and environments with the technical information help available therefore are at the intermediate level in adition campus most notably undergraduate students graduate students and contractors who have the ability to configure and resolve wide range of problems that arise from the use of technology to optimize its use for the learning and productivity on the other hand there is percentage of students of undergraduate graduate students faculty contractors and administrative that require suport and asistance when technologies do not do they work figure technical problem resolution index basic intermediate advanced undergraduate students graduate students regular teachers contractors plant administrators in relation to the identification of technological neds and responses se figure to the same as the previous index al roles are at an intermediate level they are receptive in evaluate the diferent posibilities that digital environments tols and services ofer to solve technological problems at given time likewise it indicates such as some administrators contractors teachers students of graduate and undergraduate students have the ability to make decisions informed when chosing tol or device for task that is not are very familiar placing themselves at an advanced level figure index identification of technological neds and responses fifty administrative of contractors staf teachers students of students of undergraduate postgraduate plant basic intermediate advanced it is also observed in figure how most of the participants are in intermediate level this denotes that they have the ability to plan and colaborate in the search for solutions to solve problems it also stands out as god percentage take the initiative and colaborate proactively contributing to the generation of knowledge being at an advanced level figure inovation index and use of digital technology creatively twenty administrative of contractors staf teachers students of students of undergraduate postgraduate plant basic intermediate advanced statistical analysis asociation analysis betwen demographic variables cros section of sociodemographic variables is caried out betwen gender role age and level of education the chi square test and the asociation of variables are aplied as shown

close to it can be concluded that the instrument in general is highly reliable furthermore it is highly favorable to perform factor analysis for dimension reduction of the variances of the empirical scores is due to the result of covariation betwen al the questions on the form the remaining is due to eror variance this alows the confidence interval to be used as an excelent parameter for the statistical credibility from the results of table it can be sen if for example the element number one question number the cronbach alpha coeficient would decrease to and there realy would not be substantial diference compared to the coeficient obtained eliminating element number question number the coeficient cronbach alpha would increase to and there would not be substantial diference either so therefore it is recomended to kep al elements table total statistics by element mean variance alpha total corelation corelation scale if the scale if the cronbach if the multiple element element

proposed concluding that with confidence level of there is relationship of dependence betwen the analyzed variables capacity advancement level report the study alowed us to investigate the level of digital skils mastery of the comunity university of the national university of colombia manizales campus and identify which are the most relevant aspects that lead to continuous improvement to achieve progres in levels of competence when mentioning the area of competence information and information literacy the the highest rated were the contractors folowed by the teachers and students of postgraduate it is important to improve capabilities in relation to navigation search and filtering of data information and digital content since the analysis shows that in al roles the highest percentage are at basic level however regular teachers and graduate students are at level intermediate this shows that they have the ability to use search engines and specialized databases either for their academic work and research so likewise in relation to the evaluation of data information and digital content it stands out that teachers have low percentage of at the basic level likewise the results showed that the highest percentage is at the intermediate level however there is minority who are at basic level administrative contractors graduate students and undergraduate students being an index that is located in the area of knowledge students are required to asume criterion when evaluating and verifying the validity of information data and digital content in relation to the level of competence in the area of comunication and colaboration despite that al the roles are enter at level higher than the basic one the study presents percentage of undergraduates graduate students teachers contractors and administrative workers who make pasive or no use in the participation of online services and networks likewise there is stil of teachers who they colaborate in basic way through digital technologies such as email for example therefore skils in the use of technological tols could be strengthened for colaborative proceses on the other hand it is highlighted that the university comunity has the skils to comunicate digitaly respecting standards of conduct placing themselves at an intermediate and advanced level where the best valued in this aspect it was the teachers in the area of creation and digital content the results indicate that the comunity university participating in the study produce digital content using diferent formats and are at an intermediate level however percentage of administrative contractors teachers graduate students and undergraduate students who are at basic level this denotes that they search create edit digital content in simple and easy way for therefore it would be important to strengthen capabilities to give greater projection in the academic activities for teachers and students and in administrative activities for their work activities in copyright and licensing there is percentage of undergraduate students graduate students teachers contractors and administrative staf plant who understand that some content may be copyrighted and despite this they use them without having any type of verification placing themselves at basic level it is necesary to intervene in this aspect to be clear about the importance of recognize copyright and its proper use it stands out in the area of security that the university comunity participating in the study has built the ability to protect their digital devices and use strategies such as the use of antivirus or paswords to reduce threats by locating in intermediate advanced level they also protect your personal data and identity digital in this last point the university has caried out campaign on treatment of data which has alowed us to obtain these results although the vast majority understand the health risks asociated with the use of technology and take into acount aspects ergonomics and their adiction there is percentage of administrative workers contractors teachers graduate students and undergraduate students undergraduate who do not take measures regarding use regarding the problem solving area of competence as wel as the previous point it is highlighted that the majority of the participants in the study show an interest in bu scar and resolve non complex technical isues related to devices and environments usual digital services plant administrators were rated beter in relation to resolution of technical problems and identification of neds in responses technological on the other hand there is lower percentage of undergraduate students graduate students teachers contractors and administrators who require suport and asistance when technologies do not work and it is important improve the level so that they understand how to solve problems at given moment acording to the results in general it can be said that this study was proposed ending the year and the aplication of the instrument was caried out in may by therefore the manizales headquarters had ben in the context of the covid pandemic for more than year which gave it digital bost and the activities stoped being face to face to move to virtual environment it is thus that the university comunity autonomously had to learn and obtain knowledge to face digital technologies and this it is evident in the results of the study where the vast majority of the indices analyzed they were valued at an intermediate level now this qualification is only reference and does not indicate the quality of competencies that the university comunity has since the instrument was designed to generaly evaluate each of the areas raised by the digcomp digital competence framework therefore in order to improve the levels of digital competence at the manizales headquarters it is recomended to go deper into training in the five areas of competence analyzed information and information literacy comunication and colaboration creation and digital content security and finaly resolution of problems in order for those who are at basic level to alow them to strengthen their capabilities and can reach an intermediate level where they can aply the knowledge and those at higher levels manage to improve their abilities digital alows them to propose strategies and participate in practice acording to iorio afirms that the digital transformation scenario imposes changes that do not alow anything static whether they are companies people or societies everything must change and especialy people and institutions must be open to unlearning and relearning constant chapter development of the proposal situation to transform recognizing the digital resources and capabilities that an institution has is esential to achieve its development growth and sustainability have mastery of competencies alows people to have the ability to create and exchange digital content comunicate and colaborate as wel as provide solutions to problems with view to achieving efective and creative development in life work and activity social services in general unesco in adition are esential to aces range of oportunities in the st century digital capabilities must be updated periodicaly to respond to the introduction of new technologies and their impact on the digital economy and digital society itu academy acording to the study caried out by gan andi the low qualification of workers colombians becomes structural problem in times of economic crisis since they present low level of adaptability to changes in the work environment on al that generated by the covid pandemic this restructuring of labor demand has increased the search for people with strengths in digital skils as wel as in advanced socioemotional and cognitive skils fedesarolo within the profiles required by companies include soft skils such as conflict resolution self learning teamwork among others which have gained greater relevance by increasing the ability to adapt to new environments labor by the workers gan andi the national university of colombia in its digital transformation proces has had to adapt to changes caused by the global public health crisis with the pandemic covid in the particular case the manizales headquarters has ben forced to restructure an acelerated way the development of teaching research extension as wel as its administrative proceses which gave digital bost and as mentioned in the report of the previous chapter the changes that the university comunity to learn about the management of digital technologies were sen reflected in the results of the study where the vast majority of the analyzed indices are evaluated at an intermediate level with the digcomp model however being the pionering university in education it is important that the university comunity and in especialy teachers and students improve their skils to higher level in such way so that they are not only involved in the aplication intermediate level but that they can have the ability to propose be critical and participate in practices at an advanced level it should be noted that the instrument used generaly evaluated the areas of digital capabilities therefore it canot be said that the analysis has ben developed in profound way and aspects such as the capabilities advanced socioemotional and cognitive skils that have become more relevant during the pandemic the university in its digital transformation project has identified thirty five change factors which are listed in six dimensions when refering to factors of change refers to phenomena that can influence to generate changes significant in the future national university of colombia when reviewing the facts of changes it is detected that the areas of competence analyzed are directly related with these factors se table and wil be fundamental element within the proces of digital transformation projected for the university likewise at the manizales headquarters the transformation program project is curently being developed organization which is carying out diagnosis of the curent functioning of the institution in order to guide the implementation of strategies to generate proposal prospective to the year the present study has alowed us to know the digital capabilities headquarters and wil be reference for the organization transformation project which contemplates the begining of the aplication of digital transformation at headquarters table digcomp

aspects to improve this wil alow have starting point for the strategies to be developed with the project digital transformation un and respond to the intended change factors front facing likewise training plan is proposed that indicates roadmap to continue to strengthen the digital capabilities of the university comunity headquarters manizales it is concluded that the theoretical proposal and methodology proposed by the competence framework digcomp its aplication in higher education institutions is valid in this case university of colombia and it is considered that the aplication of data colection and analysis instruments levels of measurement of results it was made based on version of the digcomp framework therefore the basic level was worked on intermediate and advanced as the result cronbach alpha aplied to the instrument obtained very close to it can be concluded that in general it is highly reliable furthermore it is highly favorable result to cary out factor analysis to reduce dimension of the variance of the empirical scores is due to the result of covariation betwen al the questions on the form the remaining is due to the eror variance this alows the confidence interval to be used as excelent parameter for statistical credibility recomendations the present investigation has potential since from this it can be undertaken studies in other headquarters

necesary for organizations that claim to be leaders of change and highly competitive in their domain furthermore today societies face chalenges and complex changes that can only be adresed and resolved only by grouping the expert knowledge and finding responsible solutions stolze et al several authors have defined digital transformation from the field of busines among them hes et al who expres that digital transformation is concerned with changes that digital technologies can cause in company busines model and resulting in modified products or organizational structures or automation of proceses from the vision of higher education institutions the transformation digital is the proces of technological and organizational change induced in them by the development of digital technologies almaraz et al consequently the higher education institutions face disruptive scenario that is establishes new busines models transforming the way they evolve in over time actively linking internal and external clients increasing your comitment and strengthening their experience in the organization this change is caled digital transformation arango serna et al on the other hand higher education institutions are also influenced and conditioned by the policies of the nation state by the global trends of the system capitalist world due to events such as the one that ocured due to the covid pandemic which are much more powerful than the changes and transformations that the institutions of higher education can produce within themselves and in the society where they reside lópez segrera acording to wrana maría pazini cited by barcos for her transformation the university must met global demands increase the number digital transformation in heis deployment model of quotas improve quality promote research optimize extension promote leadership provide lifelong educational services focus on learning and skils training redefining its mision and above al the dynamics of relationships and the sped of information they must have management structures and systems of information to make transparent agile and efective decisions and for proces continuous and careful evaluation capable of measuring the objectives that are achieved for its part kuzu expreses that digital transformation ocurs to determine the neds and behaviors of stakeholders and provide education research and social services in acordance with the demands of users beneficiaries who take advantage of the services in competition in an environment changing this means digitization of basic services academics students with advanced digital capabilities and decision suport systems that can adapt to circumstances it is crucial that each university develops its own digital transformation strategy to achieve this goal they must evaluate the potential of digital teaching and learning oferings for their institutions and take them decisions about which ones to use based on your individual profiles budgets and specific objectives furthermore this wil require partners and close coperation with the government the busines sector and civil society dräger et al however even though the concept of digital transformation has gained importance within the academic comunity there is stil lack of consensus on the implementation around digital transformation in educational institutions higher on which components are relevant which architectures are the most apropriate to develop digital transformation in educational institutions superior this interest has ben increasing since the begining of the pandemic as garner describes in the heis rapidly promoted proceses of digital transformation then in they were forced to venture into blended learning learning methodologies and in the interest in improve and or sustain these changes over time garner at the end of the road no there is an implementation model that facilitates the understanding of the transformation digital in higher education institutions in colombia aded to the above it has ben posible to identify that the basis of the literature of the digital transformation in latin american universities is stil limited with respect to introduction to empirical studies idc infodoc ara ngo serna et al castro benavides et al ramírez montoya rodriguez abitia bribiesca corea aditional eforts are required to gain beter understanding of how integrate and complement the dimensions involved in transformation proceses and how to improve the maturity levels of the digital transformation of institutions of higher education castro benavides et al fernández et al consequently and taking into acount the knowledge gap identified the research aims to design an implementation model that explains and guide digital transformation in public higher education institutions in colombia the novelty of this work is in proposing holistic model of digital transformation that sen as an organizational transformation relates the organizational socio cultural and technological perspectives within the institutions of higher education reflected in their level of maturity as part of this objective wil explore the interelationships betwen the perspectives considered and their efect on the maturity levels of digital transformation in higher education institutions this phase of the study is considered original both for the creation of the instrument of measurement of digital transformation in higher education institutions as wel as for its content validation proces by experts absent in the literature the research considers the quantitative study aproach whose livelihod epistemological is positivism sampieri et al the models are implemented structural equations structural equation modeling sem as multivariate data analysis technique becket et al martínez fiero in sem modeling the aproach wil be folowed refering to the method partial least squares pls sem the scope of the study focuses on al of the public universities of colombia for which survey wil be caried out by university with specific actors rectors cio heads of administrative departments directors vice rectors researchers it leaders with respect to the empirical study as it is only aplied to public universities of colombia it is not posible to make statements about other educational levels or global contexts as wel as the analysis of information on factors digital transformation in heis deployment model potentialy influential factors such as the size of the university the date of foundation the main methodology the funds alocated to digital transformation proceses the institutional quality and the educational level of digital transformation leaders this document is made up of chapters chapter describes the design of the investigation refering to the pl aproach to the research problem adreses the problematic situation literature review knowledge gap question general research subsequently in chapter the methodology of the research specifying the sem pls phases that wil be caried out to achieve the proposed objectives in chapter the theoretical framework that wil suport the creation of the implementation model of digital transformation in healthcare institutions higher education then in chapter the description of the study design takes place empirical definition of the research hypotheses the study population dimensions variables and measurements are constructed the measurement instrument is designed and validated measure of digital transformation in higher education institutions and defines the information colection protocol next there is chapter with the results of the empirical study starting with the explanation of the foundations conceptual concepts of structural equation models the results are described and analysis of the measurement and structural models and the results are discused finaly there is chapter of conclusions which presents the main results limitations of the research as wel as some theoretical and practical implications he the chapter ends with future lines of research finaly it includes the bibliographic references and anexes that suport the research design of the investigation problematic situation organizational transformation is topic that has ben studied for some time now several decades considering it as proces through which organizations they examine what they were what they are what they wil ned to be and how to make changes necesary to face the future kilman et al this is how in the environment contemporary busines where organizations must be inovative flexible and faster due to uncertainty complexity and changing environment the complex and diverse nature of strategy makes the concept of fit each increasingly problematic hiekanen et al curently and as consequence of the fourth industrial revolution companies in almost al industries have caried out series of initiatives to explore new digital technologies and take advantage of their benefits mat et al facing organizational transformation in world digital as digital transformation which to date has ben analyzed from the perspectives technological digital transformation is based on the use of new digital technologies such as social networks mobile devices analytics or devices integrated organizational digital transformation requires change in proceses organizational or the creation of new busines models and social the digital transformation is phenomenon that is influencing al aspects of life human for example improving the customer experience reis et al this reality makes there diferent definitions and apropriations of digital transformation authors such as reis et al expres that digital transformation is the use of new digital technologies that enable significant busines improvements and influence al aspects of clients lives for schwab digital transformation is the result of organizational change where people proceses and the busines model busines they understand technology as tol to generate value among their consumers and colaborators likewise wade points out digital transformation in heis as an imperative deployment model and has led organizations to rethink how they can use technology to improve their performance or expand their busineses digital transformation is al about fundamentaly with change and involves people proceses strategies structures and competitive dynamics authors such as solis et al consider that the digital transformation involves realignment or new investment in technology and models comercials to more efectively engage digital customers at each point of contact in the life cycle of the customer experience companies should think in digital transformation as formal efort to renew the vision models and comercial investments for new digital economy for his part goble specifies it as the profound transformation of activities proceses competencies and busines and organizational models to take ful advantage of the changes and oportunities from combination of digital technologies and their acelerated impact on society in strategic and prioritized way from general perspective as can be deduced from the definitions given by the authors digital transformation is complex problem that afects many or al segments within company managers must balance simultaneously the exploration and exploitation of the resources of their companies to achieving organizational agility necesary condition for sucesful transformation of their busineses hes et al in response to the problem the institutions of higher education are not imune to this imperative change as concluded by faria nóvoa saying that this transformation pre establishes that taking advantage of eficiently al the oportunities and potential ofered by the large number of digital technologies available completely redefine busines models in the entire value chain is not simple and of course it is complex task this chalenge is more presing for organizations that are constantly trying to ensure their competitive position in global market but the same wory is becoming relevant to universities as competition to select to the best students and researchers aligned with this scenario lópez segrera states that higher education institutions are influenced and conditioned by the policies of the nation state and by the global trends of the capitalist world system it sems that these influences on the university are much more powerful than the changes and transformations that can be produced by higher education institutions within themselves and in the society where they reside chapter research design and universities compete globaly for students academics and financing funds and only those that remain relevant and take advantage of the new digital capabilities wil benefit in this digital era pwc as wel as many companies higher education institutions have responded to the impact of digitalization through multiple separate and uncordinated initiatives as consequently they run the risk of not considering important elements of the digital transformation or ignore solutions that are more favorable for situations specific which could have unintended adverse consequences hes et al in adition to the above as result of the rapid pace of technological change and the ubiquitous technologies that emerge almost daily there is no one size fits al solution everyone that suports efective digital transformation in organizations carcary et al the chalenge is exacerbated by the fact that digital transformation organizational covers the entire scope of the organization and requires rethinking completenes of skil sets and investment strategy olanrewaju et al faced with this scenario higher education institutions are caled to face digital transformation sen as an organic metamorphosis and structural that wil have to be adapted over time making use of the the institution own resources making the most of human resources and the environment that surounds it to guarante its survival arango serna et al systematic literature review to clarify the existing knowledge gap this section presents review systematic literature folowing the prisma protocol to show that it is complete objective and reliable description and not partial review of sample for convenience castro benavides et al the folowing section describes conducting systematic literature review proposal digital transformation in heis deployment model objectives of the rsl the objective of this systematic review of the literature is to determine the dimensions actors and implementations that have taken place in the proces of tr digital transformation within higher education institutions to this end the systematic review translates the research objective into the folowing main research questions rq question structure as requested in shamser et al the questions that the review wil adres with reference to pico are rq how is the digital transformation reflected in higher education institutions in literature digital transformation has become relevant within organizations without however it is desirable to explore what is meant by digital transformation its scope and implications within higher education institutions this research question has ben maped into the folowing questions mq what definitions of digital transformation are established in the literature and do they aply to higher education institutions mq who have ben the main researchers in digital transformation in higher education institutions mq how has research on digital transformation evolved in higher education institutions over time it is required taking into acount the dates the number of publications and the countries rq how has digital transformation ben aproached in educational institutions superior universities have aproached digital transformation from diferent perspectives dimensions it is required within the context to identify them highlight their characteristics relationships and contribution to the consolidation of digital transformation within the higher education institutions likewise it is important to identify who are the chapter research design main actors involved and what have ben the most comon erors that prevent the progres of digitalization proces this research question has ben maped into the folowing questions mq what are the main dimensions involved in digital transformation of higher education institutions mq how are the dimensions of the digital transformation of companies interelated higher education institutions mq how have the actors aproached the digital transformation of the institutions of higher education mq what has ben the route established by higher education institutions to cary out your digital transformation methods next the methods aplied in this research wil be described eligibility criteria the studies wil be selected acording to the criteria detailed below continuation study designs studies are included where it is posible to identify which dimensions of higher education institutions have ben permeated by digital transformation who has intervened in these proceses their methodology the technologies adopted among others taking into acount the sugestion given by kitchenham ebse using criteria pico to identify keywords and search strings defined from research questions the folowing is considered population higher education institutions their actors and interested parties intervention studies of interest to researchers on the digital transformation and its implementations components technologies etc digital transformation in heis deployment model comparison in this study no intervention of comparison results proposals asociated with the implementation of digital transformations in higher education institutions time al studies that were published betwen and april wil be selected for inclusion because the year is considered starting point that recognizes the birth of the internet as one of the foundations of digital transformation configuration there wil be restrictions by document type articles and minutes wil be analyzed of congreses language we wil include articles reported in english to avoid bias recognizing this language as the universal language sources of information the search was caried out through the electronic databases web of science and scopus since they are the most relevant scientific information platforms that aces to scientific databases and the most significant publications of the diferent areas of knowledge in particular on digital transformation isues in higher education institutions both databases alow searching for advanced structures using operators logical ones that conform to the specifications of the systematic review proposed in this investigation as wel as the filtration and bibliometric analysis tols that provide valuable information for the proposed systematic review furthermore the university national and the university of quindío have aces to these available databases for their students and researchers search strategies one of the most subtle but relevant moments of an slr is the shoting strategy structured search since it must alow the filtering of the information available in the databases so that the selected articles answer the questions raised in the investigation and consequently the declared objective is met thechapter research design search strategy should alow evaluation of the completenes of the search kitchenham et al in response to this requirement the words contained in the search strategy identify the keywords considered in the pico model and also the questions of investigation identification the structured search that was used to find the articles was digital transformation and higher education institution or universit the search string adapted to the syntax required by the institute databases of scientific information web of science is as folows subject digital transformation and subject higher education institution or universit refined by languages english and types of documents article

used to perform two tasks basicaly first it was to manage the articles resulting from the search in scientific databases and eliminate references duplicates second clasify the information of each article underlining with color diferent depending on the category on the other hand to document and manage data resulting from the folowing prisma protocol excel was used made it easy to folow the diagram flow once the selection proces is completed the work bok is composed through several tabs where each phase was documented in them al information is post to url ing and can be acesed at any time selection proces search screning inclusion exclusion criteria for the present study the folowing inclusion exclusion criteria of articles are taken into acount found chapter research design duplicate references wil be removed using the mendeley tol used for information management subsequent analysis purification and clasification of articles with this tol al duplicate references were removed so the articles totals after purging were table shows the result of the search string in section we obtained total of records after removing duplicates and sumaries incorect records were selected table number of articles without duplicates source number of articles without duplicates web os science scopus eligibility inclusion exclusion criteria the inclusion criteria exclusion folow the conditions detailed below the title and sumary of the resulting works are analyzed and the folowing are aplied inclusion criteria articles include the sequence words digital transformation in their title and the articles include in their abstract the sequence words hei or university the criterion was aplied by reading the titles and abstracts of the downloaded studies to evaluate whether the resulting works caried out research focused on the digital transformation in higher education institutions it was marked with the number if the word apeared and marked with the number if the word apeared word did not apear in cases where the title and abstract were not suficient to make decision the entire content of the article is evaluated to clasify whether document met these criteria the folowing was performed logical operation if and title abstract count if abstract abstract candidate articles no digital transformation in heis implementation model in first review quick reading of the title and sumary of the text articles completely evaluated as eligible selected records met the described inclusion criteria and were labeled as candidate articles articles ful text articles excluded with reasons one article was excluded because there was another very similar from the same author in some cases the keywords did not exactly match those described in the inclusion exclusion criteria in this case careful reading of the text was caried out to identify whether the authors had included synonyms or expresions that reflected the digital transformation in higher education institutions for example digitization digital busines model busines digital transformation digital teaching those documents were included in the folowing stages to continue their analysis inclusion included quality evaluation criteria one of the tasks described as critical by kitchenham et al is the evaluation criterion of quality and is therefore considered chalenge in systematic review furthermore an initial dificulty is that there is no agred definition of quality of study however the crd guidelines and the manual of the cochrane reviewers sugest that quality relates to the extent to which the study minimizes bias and maximizes internal and external validity researcher wieringa et al exposes some aproaches to evaluation criteria for example is the problem clearly stated are the properties causal or clearly established problem logic is the research method sound the knowledge validation is validated in other words is the conclusion suported for the document is this significant increase in knowledge of these situations in other words are the lesons learned interesting there is enough discusion on related work for this purpose kitchenham et al constructed quality questionaire based on questions that afect the quality of the study and were scored to provide general measure of its quality in this sense the questions were adapted to the study curent and the folowing questions are relevant to the extent that they define the inclusion exclusion of articles for complete reading and subsequent analysis that is instead from only considering dedicated solutions platforms or systems the document shouldchapter research design consider the evolutionary characteristics of digital transformation in educational institutions higher education the questions have ben clasified into two categories the first evaluates the study design of the article and the second the design of the system study design included are articles that demonstrate the goal and proces of digital transformation

questions how is the digital transformation reflected in higher education institutions in the literature rq digital transformation within higher education institutions has ben adresed from diferent perspectives there were articles that provide diferent aproaches and definitions related to digital transformation in institutions of chapter research design higher education researchers grab et al present the transformation digital as disruptive element that fundamentaly changes industries and entire organizations while researchers bresinsky von reusner they recognize that digitized organizations must focus both on the domain of technology as wel as in the social domain for sucesful transformation furthermore the researchers henriete et al betcho rodrigues pérez gama sandhu consider digital transformation in educational institutions higher education from an aligned renewal busines model perspective with technological trends furthermore researcher rodrigues ads elements involved in the digital transformation proces such as people proceses competitive strategies structures and dynamics on the other hand researchers sulivan staib kaminskyi et al involve social aspect that intervenes in the digital transformation proces pointing the transformation towards the life cycle of the customer experience and how digital transformation improves or replaces traditional products and services furthermore researchers faria nóvoa link digital transformation as resource to create aditional and diferentiated value and also expand the spectrum of digital transformation in educational institutions superior to interactions acros company borders with customers competitors and supliers likewise kaminskyi et al introduce an organic structure the it architecture management to structure inovation eforts in education the authors fleacă and thoring et al observe the digital transformation from the educational dimension that integrates digital technologies into teaching practices learning and organization finaly researchers stolze et al propose chalenges in the digital transformation culture of change risk taking and inovation with the suport of their leaders and training the folowing paragraphs give aditional details on the transformation dimensions digital in higher education institutions teaching dimension digital transformation sen from the teaching dimension it has several fronts of intervention like this digital platforms and content for teaching and learning the authors bozhko et al consider that it is important to use tols that satisfy the digital transformation in heis deployment model contemporary educational standards and methods such as tols based on digital technology henriete et al in line with the authors wildan zulfikar et al who consider apropriate the nature of the platform that alows users students study at their own pace complete the curiculum without being restricted for while one of the requirements to use these platforms is the digitization of the learning resources as wel as the inclusion of introductory training courses about digital transformation from diferent perspectives for example hula et consider the concept of teaching digitalization such as training sesions alternative and complementary theory and practice the training aims improve understanding of how digital technologies can improve training sesions practical training how digital technologies and strategies can be implemented in company and how value is created with busines models based on digitization imparting knowledge and skils for the industry and academics furthermore researchers panichkina et al expres the formation of the human resources management system in the conditions of digital transformation of the economy similarly stolze et al reflect on conceptualization of novel educational aproach in entrepreneurship for digital transformation inovation of pedagogical methodologies the authors bond et al emphasize that the inovations in digital teaching are not just technical inovations but inovations academic curicular organizational and structural furthermore blaschke hase emphasized that the use of the posibilities of digital technology can make the teaching and learning to be more flexible and lead to higher atendance student and lifelong learning skils therefore fleacă citing the comunication on european higher education in the world expres that the institutions higher education institutions must fulfil their function of being providers of knowledge and inovators taking advantage of new trends in digital education exploiting the potential of digital technologies developing new forms of colaboration internationaly through online teaching and learning in wide spectrum of disciplines in this regard the use of digital educational resources is perceived as new role for teachers and students creating flexible and motivating and more autonomous fleacă aditionaly teachers are encouraged to integrate colaboration tols within your courses ensuring that chapter research design students have dep understanding of the pedagogical purpose behind its use from the begining of course as wel as training on how to use the technology peterson and how to work colaboratively with others bond et al besides researchers bresinsky von reusner introduce that aproaches participatory changes the student from pasive recipient of knowledge to active co creators and participants in the generation of knowledge the digital transformation takes advantage of the emergence of new pedagogical proposals he authors pérez gama advises designing and implementing inteligent models focused on students to improve their cognitive and academic productivity by for example the authors stolze et al presenting the dep dive program that combines work on real project in the field of digital transformation with further academic education open to both undergraduate students and motivated profesionals who se the new chalenge of digital transformation as oportunity and want to educate themselves more furthermore bresinsky von reusner consider living lab as an evolution that indicates an in situ nature of research development and inovation combining multi stakeholder aproach interested parties multiple methods multiple contexts and with clear user focus on co creation another proposal by hula et al are the learning factories that they impart knowledge and skils for both industry and academics al of them integrate traditional theoretical learning with activation and colaboration towards comprehensive concept stimulating maximum results of learning bresinsky von reusner literacy and digital skils in the digital economy the ned arises for new highly profesional workforce with digital skils and competencies in the field of technology and comunication azarenko et al the digital transformation of the training proces of profesional personel consists of raising the level of abstraction in the development and use of profesional skils that alow us move from technical and low level concepts to more significant and high level concepts higher bond et al furthermore researchers bond et al citing pensel hofhues expres that in terms of teachers perspectives universities are often said to be the driving forces for implementing and develop digital teaching and learning and for this reason it is recomended digital transformation in heis deployment model technical and pedagogical guidance the introduced teaching concept ofers students participants the posibility of acquiring skils knowledge and abilities in the field of digitalization hula et al furthermore the digital transformation in higher education institutions must be thought of from global aproach the researchers bresinsky von reusner propose developing the skils described in the digital turn hfd as set of skils for digitization that is the secure handling of information and privacy isues complex problem solving analytical thinking colaborative work and self organized in heterogeneous teams agility interpersonal and social skils and intercultural furthermore researchers azarenko et al expres that the highly profesional staf should be able to interact with other people work in multicultural environments have the skils of empathy concentration and management of atention maintain information hygiene to work and manage information on modern information environments in media in social networks in marketing and in analytical environments teaching administration proces from an administrative level the authors tay low reflect that many higher education institutions have taken advantage of the use of technology to provide flexibility in learning and training just in time for students and to improve both the internal proceses of availability of courses such as educational quality provisions likewise the researcher rodrigues contemplates the evolution of teaching administration from perspective competitive where global competition for candidates takes place changes demographics restrictions on aces to financial resources new demands of the labor market and the growing expectations of students to inovate their learning teaching research and management experiences infrastructure dimension digital transformation in educational institutions top view from the infrastructure dimension has various fronts depending of the dimension it suports the folowing sections describe them digital infrastructure for teaching digital platforms and comunication platforms learning are important tols that satisfy the standards and methods contemporary educational systems bozhko et al wildan zulfikar et al bresinsky von reusner chapter research design physical infrastructure for teaching such as laboratories for example learning factory hula et al and living lab bresinsky von reusner data infrastructure and security the author rodrigues expreses that the use growing digital technologies and the growing conectivity of everything also entails major chalenges in the level of security compliance and data protection and regulations software infrastructure an agile platform is contemplated flexible architecture that could handle adaptive and emergent proceses administrative teaching and research faria nóvoa tay low fleacă thoring et al stolze et al curiculum dimension this dimension has several views depending on the development proces digital transformation that has ben caried out curiculum modernization the modernization of curicula to met the contemporary educational standards and methods developing curicula international finding new ways to deliver content through the digital learning and the increasing use of technologies bozhko et al fleacă bond et al first tols based on digital technology to increase the relevance of the skils training proces in order to provide greater oportunities for students to acquire those skils transversal and second implement curiculum aces codes outside the institution higher education kaminskyi et al finaly the result of the proceses of curiculum modernization should be administered by the department of curiculum management tay low flexible curiculum global requirements in the educational field have transcended boundaries of time and space this is expresed in azarenko et al the standards of the third generation vocational education institutions receive considerable degre of fredom in the implementation of variable part of the educational program and set of selected disciplines which alows them to adjust it oportunely taking into acount takes into acount the development of science technology culture economy and the sphere social because the main objective of updating the educational program is response digital transformation in heis deployment model flexible to the neds of the labor market for example researchers stolze et to the intend to suport real busines projects in smal groups and acording to their neds through an individualized study plan flexible rather than standard cohort curiculum and the creation of system integrated independent evaluation of qualifications in the field of ict digital curiculum author rodrigues concluded that students demand increasingly an improvement in the basics of your experience with features such as the digitization of administrative proceses unlimited hour aces to al information and services using multiple platforms or digital curiculum to raise this requirement it is necesary to digitize al study plans thoring et al pérez gama furthermore researcher sandhu states that comon learning digital education centers information centers have revolutionized teaching and learning by enabling suporting changes in pedagogy curicular and digital management dimension improve existing work and operations in in reality higher education institutions use transformation strategies digital to improve how they do their existing work aply changes to the creation of value reflect the influence of digital transformation while building new digital models in paralel or completely digitizing their curent considering the new demands of the labor market and the increasing expectations of students to inovate their learning teaching research and management experiences rodrigues faria nóvoa in that sense these structural changes are necesary to exploit new technologies and in the back ofice the area managers of the diferent units human resources acounting financial purchasing advisory units estuary legal etc to plan asign and monitor the work to be caried out faria nóvoa financial and technological aspects digital transformation requires large investments therefore many chalenges in digital transformation in educational institutions higher are related to financial aspects and technological limitations namely the ability to finance digital transformation efort given the efort required to get rid of the past and adopt new and extreme technologies rodrigues faria nóvoa pérez gama chapter research design reorganize administrative units the changes caused by transformation digital in higher education institutions are not only limited to infrastructure technological but they extend to the levels of the organizational structure of the institution depending on the digital transformation proces that wil be caried out within of higher education institutions the responsible department must asume its comitment which is consistent with their capabilities and abilities therefore the authors faria nóvoa azarenko et al thoring et al reconsider that higher education institutions and their administrative units become requirement furthermore they decide the most eficient way to provide the service to eliminate most bureaucratic proceses and paralel tasks aditional ones that fatigue rather than provide relief for this aproach to be sucesful universities must restructure their delivery model academic and administrative governance begining with change of mentality away from administrative thinking towards an entrepreneurial mentality and redesigning the administrative and busines academic model of the institution through the recognition of oportunities demonstrating the ability to act quickly and precision agilely developing new concepts and alowing an infrastructure flexible and suportive stolze et al pérez gama informed decision making digital transformation within units administrative functions wil alow staf members to manage proceses in their hands record the dates of tasks archive the documents produced and exchange mesages with other parties interested in the proceses furthermore the reports of activity and service level indicators integrated with the mechanisms of busines inteligence provides comprehensive view of busines proceses in course and critical vision for efective decision making faria nóvoa research dimension the research dimension has also ben impregnated by digital transformation research is forced to align with the digital transformation to met the requirements and expectations of actors involved in the proceses research projects rodrigues first the authors bresinsky von reusner thoring et al hula et al have shown interest in achieving the integration of research proceses with the proceses of digital transformation in heis deployment model teaching learning secondly the author pérez gama considers that the research must merge with inovation to generate intelectual asets digital finaly profesor wildan zulfikar et al contemplates that one of the drivers of change in higher education institutions is the integration of industry where students are exposed to more practical learning proceses based on the industry and on the other hand the existence of research asociations human resources dimension there is relationship betwen digital transformation in higher education institutions and human resources on the one hand the transformation digital influences and impacts human resources factors and contributes to improving the productivity betcho on the other hand the digital capabilities of the resources humans are the key facilitator of university digital transformation through competent digital workforce sandhu in that sense the dimension of human resources has diferent aproaches first authors bresinsky von reusner clair sulivan staib grab et al reflect that the domains where these organizations are inovating quickly and comprehensively are the virtual colaboration and data analysis this means avoiding old forms of leadership hierarchical and lead leadership towards more agile ways of working leadership not only to explore evaluate and plan the implementation of new technologies but also to take into acount the impact of these inovations on the members of the organization secondly the researcher betcho expreses that there must be efective cordination betwen the implementation and use of digital technologies to reap the benefits in human resource development talent and management performance thirdly the authors tay low azarenko et al consider the ned to train new staf in the use of quality asesment independent competition and in the establishment of integration links betwen superiors finaly the authors betcho azarenko et al hula et al pérez gama consider the importance of digital transformation within of public organizations and their impact on human resources factors related such as human resource development talent and performance management intelectual and creative abilities staf creativity and competences for future workforce as digital talent equiped with digital experience such to promote implement and maintain the system towards the iv industrial revolution chapter research design extension dimension another dimension permeated by the digital transformation in higher education institutions is the extension dimension the authors clair sulivan staib azarenko et al panichkina et al consider defining the use of independent certification of competence and the establishment of links of integration betwen universities specialized secondary schols large companies and public administration in the region furthermore the oportunity to improve the adaptation mechanisms of graduates in the labor market through interaction of educational organizations and companies where the qualification of workers in terms of turning them into digital apendages reducing the proportion of workers with average skils who are easier to replace by digital technologies furthermore pérez gama considers that one of the pilars of the digital transformation model is the social projection of the institution both at the internal and external for the transfer of knowledge and technologies that promote the productivity and competitivenes of the country governance dimension of digital transformation an important chalenge that organizations face today is how to adopt and take advantage of the new digital technologies since the ability to promote digital transformation is largely determined by clear digital strategy enabled by culture of change risk taking and inovation suported by their leaders stolze et al in consequently the governance dimension of digital transformation exists in higher education institutions because for highly digitalized organization it is crucial to understand and manage the change management of digital inovations such as an important factor in sucesful implementation bresinsky von reusner clair sulivan staib likewise the analysis of the neds of the institution education must be aligned and within the scope of the governance strategy and the higher education management model taking into acount the diferent scenarios normative and non normative as wel as the theory of corporate governance must corespond to the theoretical organizational and strategic aspects of the asignment resource inovator fleacă faria nóvoa azarenko et al pérez gama furthermore this implies taking into acount risk management to minimize the impact of these inovations on organizational members bresinsky von reusner grab et al digital transformation in heis deployment model information dimension the information dimension in digital transformation in higher education institutions it is very valuable aset bear therefore must be aligned and consistent with the busines architecture of educational institutions superior first to enrich the internal formulation and implementation proces strategicaly data from multiple sources can be simplified so that busines planing busines more agile and efective also with the help of data analysis and big data can be translated into comercial value while companies can stil benefit more of an open information policy that alows ideas to travel frely to the within an organization thoring et al grab et al in this sense the digital transformation requires data architecture and its public data model with exchange oportunities betwen universities faria nóvoa kaminskyi et al aditionaly it introduces managers and resource profesionals humans as key actors to guarante the efective management of the transformation of data in busines betcho secondly from the perspective of teaching in modern conditions educational materials are already created in formats digital and become the key facilitator of online education sandhu marketing dimension the marketing dimension is integrated into the transformation digital in higher education institutions as new facet of educational institutions higher education that requires digital marketing model to enter the networks social and other digital media that open education options in the markets emerging increase the apropriation of academic talent and the emergence of brands global universities wildan zulfikar et al pérez gama besides benefit from the existing and secure platforms frequented by many users while ofering broader range of products and services grab et al busines proces dimension in the context of the busines proces the digital transformation forces companies to develop change and adapt to the diferent stages of digital evolution in other words it promotes the reinvention of institution the transition from related operating procedures to the use of digital technologies to improve improve or replace traditional services with digital to simplify the proceses involved in the provision of services educational and operational complexity tay low faria nóvoa chapter research design kaminskyi et al clair sulivan staib wildan zulfikar et al bond et al thoring et al grab et al pérez gama from the student perspective they increasingly demand an improvement in the basics of their experience as users with features such as the digitalization of proceses administrative unlimited hour aces to al information and to the cycle apas of student life in the busines proces system from admision to university until graduation and services using multiple platforms or resume digital rodrigues kaminskyi et al what an architecture infers institutional with vision that integrates al eforts in productivity and quality towards the objective of the competitivenes model which consolidates the digital transformation pérez gama how has the digital transformation ben directed in educational institutions superior rq digital transformation guidelines in higher education institutions from vision macro organizational digital transformation requires wel rounded digital strategy planed that includes the digital transformation framework in which al key actors and interested parties can play an active role in shaping the university to thrive in the digital age sandhu in this sense the main chalenges of the digital transformation of higher education institution it is the definition of strategic vision for digital transformation the institutions of higher education ned strategic vision that alows the entire institution join in the implementation of digital initiatives clear vision wil make the team and stakeholders become more involved and invested in the transformation proces digital for digital strategy to be sucesful it is necesary to ensure that the higher education institutions have the necesary resources for their implementation rodrigues asuming that the general objective of digital transformations in the information system higher education is the transformation of educational services and proceses of acompanying busines there are thre diferent posible directions that ned to be analyzed transformation and redefinition of educational services to match the changes to the university busines proces system transformation of digital transformation in heis deployment model busines proceses aimed at creating new and improving busines proceses existing it based systems as the basis for further analysis and transformation of educational services combining the first and second directions to integrate the simultaneous transformation in both directions kaminskyi et al in the aspect of the transformation of products and services the folowing stages are distinguished improvement ad aditional services expansion ad new product features or existing services through digital components and redefinition creating new products or services that replace the previous ones in terms of the proceses of busines the stages are as folows creation the emergence of new busines proceses busines on the basis of it leverage the emergence of new there are oportunities for achieve greater eficiency of busines proceses and integration the combination of new and traditional busines proceses in single infrastructure in what refers to synthesis of the key digital transformation guidelines the authors faria nóvoa describe the main pilars of digital transformation develop new services based on digital improve user experience renginering of proceses strengthen technological infrastructures promoting their agility and adaptability and develop decision making suport system to analyze the curent and future university the author wildan zulfikar et al considered canvas taking into acount digital transformation from proces focused vision educational teaching learning the authors consider the folowing researchers hula et al citing levy murnane say that the fourth industrial revolution propagates the idea that personel focus on activities inovative creative and comunicative likewise citing gehrke kühn rule indicate that workers wil have to perform more complex and indirect tasks such as work with robots and colaborating machines aditionaly they must deal with the information generated in real time as wel as greater amount of data and comunicate with machines therefore teaching and learning environments would have to be consistent with these requirements and the emergence of comon learning areas centers of digital education digital learning centers information areas that have revolutionized teaching and learning the topic of digital pedagogy is presented such as the use of electronic elements to improve or change the experience of the education sandhu while others recognize the entrepreneurial mentalitychapter research design as driver of digital transformation therefore they consider the first step in the co creation proces to conduct discusion among the leaders of higher education institutions and the center for entrepreneurship and series of relevant stakeholders faculty faculty deans and industry partners and technological through individual metings and broader workshop to formulate the requirements and guidelines for future training in the field of entrepreneurship and digitization stolze et al regarding the perspectives of university teachers it is often said that they are the driving forces for implementing and developing digital teaching and learning and for this reason technical and pedagogical guidance is recomended bozhko et al depending on the teaching learning methodology and the results of the learning strategies wil be developed researchers hula et al they mention the instit inovation projects as very important infrastructure resource important where training laboratories based on studies of cases similarly the authors bozhko et al sugest guide that consists of several laboratory tasks containing theoretical information calculation task practical task laboratory guide and self test questionaire providing the conection betwen diferent disciplines finaly profesor fleacă delves into the proces based model to design digital practices of teaching and learning the proces based model begins with the variables of necesary input such as educational organization data and ofers capabilities digital teaching and learning to the organization in the atempt to define and integrate digital learning technologies in organizational practices another aproach is the living labs concept that alows coperation in al stages of development proces development ideation conceptualization testing prototyping validation development exploitation and marketing in participatory aproach to the network of real world context bridging the gap betwen exploration and exploitation and knowledge and solutions bresinsky von reusner as mentioned above from teaching perspective digital transformation of higher education institutions requires the creation of learning guides but also the learning resources that must be developed to met the requirements established by the guidelines the authors tay low digital transformation in heis deployment model describe that the proces of developing learning resources in institutions higher education involves planing and cordination among multiple groups functions of the academic faculty and administrative oficials these include internal departments as wel as external stakeholders publishers and supliers external parties involved in the creation and delivery services of course materials to higher education institutions digital transformation center authors kaminskyi et al specify as part of the implementation of digital transformation in higher education institutions that the university busines proces system requires the creation of directory administrative services for the training and internal investigation proces personel management infrastructure management and other suport services of the same likewise the authors faria nóvoa detailed how service center was created shared at the center of the digital busines strategy for digital transformation in higher education institution with the aim of improving the quality of the services provided to the academy and reducing overal costs from the point in view of teaching the authors thoring et al consider in instead of centralization of information knowledge and experience in the field of digital education teachers want digitization center at that they can contact for information and practical advice on services existing computer systems advice on digital teaching concepts and suport in the implementation of new digitalization ideas acording to sandhu the centers libraries have ofered services such as platform development and suport technological learning management systems digital asesment tols diagnostic tols plagiarism software etc suport instructional design development of new type of learning spaces digital enrichment to suport problem based colaborative competency based learning and also establishment of research data management service these centers suport pedagogicaly through quality and wel designed technological spaces that include interactive computing multimedia creation large scale visualization in visualization studio scan printing renginering proces to be sucesful digital transformation in healthcare institutions higher education requires profound renginering of al suport proceses chapter research design task that must be treated with dep sensitivity and atention to overcome the natural resistance to change of the diferent headquarters within the institutions of higher education the company taking into acount that the digital transformation promotes the reinvention of the pérez gama institution and due to the size of the university and the hundreds of proceses managed daily renginering and certification of al proceses and the dematerialization of document management while maintaining the agility of technological infrastructures is very demanding proces requiring an inovative aproach to be sucesful compilation and execution system it is required to develop system that has the agility to evolve harmonize and consolidate procedures as they emerge naturaly faria nóvoa competence center authors such as thoring et al and bozhko et al consider the center of teaching and learning as suport to the members of the faculty at the university information and practical suport including introductory courses for teaching and learning as wel as range of courses for the development profesional related to university teaching taking into acount that the university education requires the development of strategy for transformation digital and the formation of new information and comunication skils is required develop digital capabilities who are the key enabler of digital transformation university through the competent digital workforce kaminskyi et al enterprise architecture it architecture management digitalization the architecture busines and busines architecture constitute conceptual tol that helps organizations understand their own structure and the aproach with which they work pérez gama the author fleacă citing dag kjersti indicates that other scholars who have studied the chalenges induced by implementation of enterprise it architecture in educational institutions higher level evidenced key benefits of integrating it systems with educational proceses in terms of greater agility of the educational organization beter decision making and lower it related risks the digital transformation of higher education institutions must go through proces caled digitalization which is converting existing physical asets into their digital transformation in heis deployment model digital form wildan zulfikar et al this proces permeates al scenarios within it from the mision and strategic proceses to the suport proceses by for this reason higher education institutions must start loking at digital comprehensively and to transform themselves by aplying digital thinking in everything they do how internal proceses operate and how they obtain their main mision rodrigues change management shift towards digital first mindset puts al staf at the forefront of inovation and busines reinvention in the digital age sandhu this change from technological difusion to digital transformation must have efect on human resources betcho in other words eforts are made on the part of the staf to maintain quality and safety against digital disruption and more research is required to beter understand the proces clair sulivan staib if digital transformation positively impacts resources humans is likely to promote visible changes in performance production service quality talent development among others betcho this is how change management must be considered in al stages of the implementation of digital transformation before during and after understand the total picture with proper governance and analysis of the entire system is esential to acurately evaluate the digital cycle clair sulivan and staib in general digital strategy depends largely on several factors some technological and others of non technological nature rodrigues some reasons for that companies do not presure to adres digitalization proceses are evident given the chalenging nature of exercise or since the standardization of internal proceses can require lot of time and resources grab et al among these factors are the culture and internal organization organizational silos organizational resistance to change the lack of resources and budget the legal and regulatory implications the understanding customer behavior or impact lack of data to justify the value of digital transformation lack of skils and digital literacy and the security rodrigues chapter research design knowledge gap in response to the demands of the fourth industrial revolution the institutions of higher education have ben forced to transform to coexist in world digital however this digital transformation not only implies technological progres it is more transcendental and generates changes so significant that they afect the culture and dynamics university in al its contexts from pedagogical aproaches teaching and learning to administrative proceses research extension infrastructure budget among others in this context digital transformation in educational institutions higher education requires rethinking restructuring reinventing the institutions of higher education from its multipurpose multiproces multidisciplinary nature multi state and multi user it is colective efort that puts the person at the center of the proces of development transformation and its impact on society from the systematic literature review the prevalence of case studies is evident conceptual and ilustrative as clear indication of the lack of maturity of this phenomenon therefore future research should focus more on establishing the theoretical foundations of the field based on existing theories or developing others new ones reis et al which alow higher education institutions adres digital transformation oportunities and chalenges objective system general objective explain the influence relationships betwen digital transformation practices and implementation of digital transformation in public universities in colombia by designing an implementation model specific objectives ob

quantitative study aproach of the investigation whose epistemological suport is positivism paradigm whose the objective is to verify hypotheses using statistical techniques or determine the diferent parameters of variable through numerical expresions sampieri et al acording to the author amador rodríguez adúriz bravo the guidelines positivists consider that science is body of knowledge made up of facts and theories that are considered true in the sense of being contrasted with the data observational and whose verification is caried out through the empiricist scientific method primacy of observation acording to sampieri et al the quantitative aproach is sequential and evidentiary the order it rigorous part of an idea that is limited and once delimited are derived objectives and research questions the literature is reviewed and framework or theoretical perspective hypotheses are established from the questions and variables are determined plan is drawn up to test them design the variables are measured in certain context the measurements obtained are analyzed using statistical methods and the series of conclusions this phase is developed under the quantitative corelational aproach the investigation quantitative aims to determine how various concepts are related or linked variables or characteristics among themselves or also if they are not related sampieri et al structural equation models wil be implemented structural equation modeling sem which is data analysis technique second generation multivariate combines aspects of factor analysis and regresion multiplex that alows simultaneously examining series of interelationships of dependence and interdependence betwen observable variables and latent variables as wel as betwen latent variables becket et al martínez fiero digital transformation in heis deployment model in sem modeling the aproach wil be folowed refering to the least squares method pls sem based on the analysis of variance which implies more flexible modeling methodology by not requiring parametric asumptions rigorous mainly in the distribution of the data pls sem emerged as technique to analyze the complex relationships betwen latent variables that alow explain the observed data and being technique under causal predictive aproach of sem emphasizes prediction in the estimation of statistical models whose structures are designed to provide explanations causal this method is also useful for confirmatory research joseph hair et al aditionaly pls sem has greater statistical power meaning that pls sem is more likely to identify relationships as meaningful when in fact they are present in the population joseph hair et al pls sem is now widely aplied in many social science disciplines including organizational management educational sciences behavioral sciences international management human resources management information management systems operations management marketing management strategic management hotel management and suply chain management as wel as the publication of several textboks edited volumes and special isues of academic journals cepeda carión roldán salgueiro martínez ávila fiero moreno joseph hair et al this statistical technique for series of estimates of simultaneous equations using multiple regresions are characterized by two basic components the structural model and the measurement model the structural model is the guiding model that shows the dependency relationships betwen independent variables exogenous and variables dependent endogenous the measurement model shows the relationships betwen the constructs latent variables and indicators observable variables in this model the contribution of each item reactive to the measurement scale is evaluated that is specifies which indicators define each construct furthermore it evaluates the reliability of constructs and indicators martínez fiero below are the steps to be caried out in the research se figure chapter research methodology figure outline of the research methodology development of measurement scales indicators data colection instrument information expert asesment based on the literature review the constructs their characteristics and the relationships betwen them the proposed digital transformation implementation model for universities then to measure the theoretical constructs the scale is considered likert an information colection instrument wil be created which represents the proposed model survey wil be developed as it is the most useful tol suitable for obtaining specific information finaly there wil be reviews of the instrument by experts to evaluate its validity content aplying the delphi method delimitation of the population the defined unit of analysis is the universities public of colombia acording to the men there are public universities in colombia the functional area that is mainly related to the proceses of digital transformation are the systems technologies inovation or research systems enginering carers and related in this sense they are the leaders or heads of these areas or departments those responsible and knowledgeable digital transformation in heis deployment model of the dynamics of digital transformation that has ben caried out within the universities survey wil be aplied per university to specific actors cio it leaders heads of administrative departments managers for other on the other hand pls sem can certainly be used with smal samples but the the nature of the population determines the situations in which population sizes smal samples are aceptable hair et al thus the size of the recomended sample in pls sem is for statistical power of with significance level of minimum of and number of two of arows pointing to the construct aplication of information colection instruments the survey wil be aplied to actors in self administered maner using software existing to guarante internal validity the same instrument wil be administered to al actors likewise to validate the external validity the instrument wil be aplied in colombian public universities analysis and procesing of information before submiting the data to analysis multivariate statistical analysis descriptive analysis of the data wil be caried out likewise due data procesing wil be done for subsequent quantitative analysis statistical analysis of the information and reporting of results it is considered to use the multivariate statistical analysis technique using the smartpls tol to validate the measurement model and contrast the structural model using the pls sem technique the data wil be analyzed folowing the procedure sugested by hair et al first the measurement model is evaluated to establish the reliability convergent validity and discriminant validity of the scales used subsequently the fit of the structural model is evaluated and whether or not they suport the research hypotheses specificaly for the development of point hair et al established the methodology that consists of the folowing stages to aply pls sem se figure chapter research methodology figure stages for analysis and validation of the model aplying pls sem stage specification of the structural model the structural model also caled internal model in the context of pls sem represents the constructs or latent variables circles or ovals the structural model also shows the relationships paths betwen the constructs latent variables can be exogenous those constructs that explain other constructs in the model or endogenous those constructs that are explained by the model trajectory models are developed based on theory hair et al in adition to observing the latent and observable variables it is also it is important to mention two aspects that may be imersed in the model and they are the mediation and moderation martínez fiero mediation involves situation where one or more mediating variables explain the proceses through the which an exogenous construct influences an endogenous one noreña on the other hand the moderation ocurs when the efect of an exogenous latent variable on variable endogenous latent variable depends on the values that third variable caled variable moderator which moderates the relationship noreña digital transformation in heis deployment model stage development and specification of the measurement model the measurement model of the constructs also caled external models in pls sem show the relationships betwen the constructs and their observable variables or indicators rectangles in general there are two diferent ways to measure unobservable variables one aproach is known as reflective model and the other is formative model in training model the arows go from the indicators to the construct indicating causal relationship predictive in that direction while reflective model the arows go from the construct towards the indicators indicating the asumption that the construct causes the measurement more precisely co variation of the indicator variables stage design study to generate empirical results in this stage it develops the colection and examination of data the apropriate sample size is evaluated and select the mising data estimation and aproximation model to run this stage researchers wil take into acount general rules such as those provided by cohen in his statistical power analyzes for multiple regresion models provided that the measurement models have aceptable quality in terms of loads external loadings must be above the comon threshold of thus the things the recomended sample size in pls sem is for power statistic of with significance level of minimum of and number two of arows pointing to the construct stage evaluation of the measurement and structural model the stage involves eforts to test the validity and reliability of the model and its coresponding theoretical relationships hypothetical validity is evaluated that is whether what is desired is being measured measure and reliability which is measure of the degre to which set of performance indicators latent variable is internaly coherent depending on the high interelationship of the indicators among themselves the individual reliability of the item internal consistency or reliability of scale convergent validity and discriminant validity in the evaluation of the global model estimation of the measurement model godnes criteria are not established adjustment covariance based sem but and evaluate the measures separately reflective and formative martínez fiero se table

loadings significance and relevance of the crosed betwen indicators and latent variables and the ratio pesos heterotrait monotrail htmt evaluation of the reflective model determination coeficients predictive relevance size and significance of path coeficients efect sizes efect sizes prior to evaluating the measurement model it should be considered if necesary the treatment of second order constructs hcm from its acronym in english hierarchical component models second order construct ocurs when latent variable it is measured by several first order latent variables in that case researchers should aply combination of the indicators aproach repeated and the use of latent variable scores in two phase hcm analysis in the first phase the model is estimated with the indicators of the first order factors ading al the previous indicators as indicators of the factor construct of second order this method is caled hcm hierarchical component method cepeda carión roldán salgueiro hair et al in second phase of pls analysis the model is estimated using the scores calculated by the program to each of the first order constructs rather than the data the scores of the first order constructs are the average loadings of the items of each component weighted with the loads estimated in the first stage cepeda carión roldán salgueiro joseph hair et al se figure digital transformation in heis deployment model figure hcm analysis aproach in two phases vl vl vl vl vl vl vl first phase duplication of indicators in the second phase score asignment second order construct vl to second order construct vl stage evaluation of reflective measures internal consistency or scale reliability acording to becket et al the construct reliability aims to test the internal consistency of al indicators by measure the concept that is the rigor with which the variables manifest they are measuring the latent variable the reliability coeficient measure which evaluates the consistency of the entire scale is cronbach alpha the lower limit generaly agred for cronbach alpha and aditionaly cronbach alpha is only aplicable to latent variables with reflective indicators cepeda carión roldán salgueiro convergent validity it is measure that indicates that set of indicators items or reagents represent single underlying construct martínez fiero is that is it evaluates the degre to which two measures of the same concept are corelated here the researcher can lok for alternative measures of concept and then corelate them with the sumed scale the high corelations here indicate that the scale you are measuring your intended concept becket et al convergent validity is calculated with the ave which measures that the variance of the construct can be explained through chapter research methodology of its indicators martínez fiero the ave must be greater than or equal to and provides the amount of variance that construct obtains from its indicators in relationship to the amount of variance due to measurement eror this means that each construct or variable explains at least of the variance of the indicators individual item reliability reliability measures the degre to which the measurements are fre of random erors this reliability examines the simple loadings or corelations of the indicators such as the construct they aim to measure the load value must be equal to or greater than since they indicate that the construct explains more than of the variance of the indicator which provides aceptable reliability of the items hair et al discriminant validity discriminant validity refers to the extent to which construct is empiricaly distinct from other constructs within the structural model hair et al the empirical test is again the corelation betwen the measurements but this time the sumed scale corelates with similar measure but conceptualy diferent now the corelation should be low showing that the scale is suficiently diferent from the other concept becket et al in sumary convergent validity confirms that the scale is corelated with other known measures of the concept while discriminant validity ensures that the scale is suficiently diferent from other concepts to be distinct becket et al aditionaly prior to validating the structural model it is necesary to study the validity and reliability of the second order constructs that wil act as indicators in the structural model stage evaluation of formative measures convergent validity is the degre to which the formatively measured construct is positively corelated with measure alternative reflective or single item of the same construct noreña the colinearity betwen indicators which arises when two variables are highly corelated and the significance and relevance of the weights which are the result of multiple regresion of construct with its indicators the weights are the main criterion to ases the relative importance of each indicator in the formative measurement models noreña digital transformation in heis deployment model stage evaluation of the structural model once the measurement model has ben analyzed requires evaluating the structural model the final stage involves eforts to test the validity of the structural model and its coresponding hypothetical theoretical relationships the structural evaluation of the model analyzes the the predictive relevance the size and the significance of the standardized regresion coeficients or path coeficients and the efect sizes and the interpretation of results and the suport or not of the hypothesis the basic pls algorithm folows two step aproach the first concerns the iterative estimation of the latent variable scores and the second step is refers to the final estimation of the weights loads and path coeficients through the estimation of ordinary least squares multiple and simple and in the analysis of main components martínez fiero stage advanced analysis once the structural model latent variables and observable it is also important to mention two aspects that may be involved in the model and they are mediation and moderation martínez ávila fiero moreno the core of mediation analysis is that it asumes sequence of relationships in which that an independent variable afects mediating variable which then afects dependent variable se figure nitzl et al mediation and moderation are similar in that they describe situations in which the relationship betwen two constructs depends on third variable mediation hapens when third mediating variable intervenes betwen two other constructs related more precisely change in the exogenous variable causes change in the mediating variable which in turn results in change in the endogenous variable in the pls path model therefore mediating variable governs nature that is the underlying mechanism or proces of the relationship betwen two constructs hair et al for its part moderation describes situation in which the relationship betwen two constructs is not constant but depends on the values of third variable caled moderating variable the moderating variable or construct changes the strength or even the direction of relationship betwen two constructs in the model hair et al the aproach separately evaluates direct indirect and total efects chapter research methodology figure general mediation model nitzl et al in adition to the analysis of mediating variables the results obtained can be expanded report the estimated path coeficients of the standard pls sem ading dimension to the analysis more specificaly the analysis of the importance performance map importance performance map analysis ipma that compares the total efects of the model structure on specific dependent construct target with the mean of the scores of the latent antecedent variables of said construct hair et al noreña as result conclusions can be drawn about two dimensions both importance and performance which is particularly significant to prioritize the management actions that should be taken consequently it is preferable focus primarily on improving the performance of those constructs that show great importance in terms of its explanation of certain objective construct but at the same time they have relatively low performance hair et al stage interpretation of results once the monitoring results are obtained of the previous stages the stage of analysis and interpretation of results begins to which decisions wil be based on the theory described in hair et al theoretical framework this section aims to contextualize the digital transformation in educational institutions higher education as an organizational transformation where they must be taken into acount acount and align diferent perspectives to synchronize digital transformation in one holistic and evolutionary integration over time this evolution may be the result of gradual change in the behavior of individual elements in the company or can be the result of deliberate and conscious action which aims to cary out changes in company harmsen et al with the fourth industrial revolution as says schwab the transformation in its scale scope and complexity wil be diferent unlike anything humanity has experienced before it is characterized by fusion of technologies that are bluring the lines betwen the physical digital and biological spheres the response must be comprehensive involving al policy stakeholders global from the public and private sectors to academia and civil society in consequently the presure on companies to align their busines strategy with the technological changes in the environment have increased significantly with the emergence and growing importance of new digital technologies the strategic context of organizations is being profoundly transformed changing the structure of competition behavior and expectations of customers the way busines is conducted the way products are made products and services are provided the way of working and ultimately the nature of entire industries teichert from the educational field the university has known how to adapt frely to the sucesive orders is socioeconomic to radical changes in science and intelectual culture if not so it has long ben would have gone down in history this scenario has alowed the university to continue to be powerful and omnipresent institution tribute that is due not so much to its transcendent virtue as if to its incesant adaptation scot adaptation required to face great chalenges variety of academic levels that proliferate digital transformation in heis deployment model rapidly and growing political controversy over the cost and financing of the postsecondary ofering the long standing monopoly of universities on production oficial knowledge now has new competitors whether from think tanks social networks or technology firms that atract top academics with data of great capacity and generous compensations the transnational competition for prominence of students and research has only increased in recent years driven in part by global hegemony of rankings as metrics of prestige such dynamism requires and rewards coherent sociology of universities as organizations eaton stevens the objective of digital transformation is continuous optimization in such way it can detect changes in the market and respond quickly goble to orchestrate these profound changes transformation is required within the universities synchronized as paradigm shift for leadership in education change ocurs as natural manifestation of the developmental sequence in the maturity transformation proces at the execution level there is the company operational related to normal operations first order system while that at the level of transformation is the busines transformation company second order system harmsen et al next digital transformation wil be explained as transformation proces organizational and its perspectives for change wil be described digital transformation as transformation organizational acording to kilman et al cited by calderón hernández et al the transformation is proces by which organizations examine what they were what they are what they wil ned to be and how to make the necesary changes for them the transformation is characterized by being non linear proces that requires great efort of the organization as whole and not simple aproximation of its parts in adition to achieve this it is necesary to understand that organizational transformations focus in human cultural social proceses encourages colaboration betwen leaders of the organization and members in conjunction with technological and structural elements calderón hernández et al pérez valejo et al on the other hand not alchapter theoretical framework organizational changes are in the same order of magnitude acording to bartunek moch organizational transformation is the work of facilitating change in organizations sugarman since the and these changes have received names like first order single lop alpha shift or second order double lop gama shift thus authors such as amir uri cited by pérez valejo et al introduced organizational change as strategic and lasting proces in the time the first order change ocurs incrementaly and is defined as those minor improvements and adjustments that do not change the core of the system and are developed naturaly within its established paradigm and the second order change is in the core of the organization and is ireversible the change has ocured in the very esence in the kernel and nothing special neds to be done to maintain the change that has ben made reached in contrast to first order change second order change has wider reach and is more durable it is deper and involves changes in the thought not only in behavior amir uri bartunek moch furthermore it is multi layered proces that simultaneously afects diferent levels of organizations and even to the context of the organization operation ferlie et al such change is often required when organizations change their basic mision enter completely new markets or when facing crisis by failing to met competitive chalenges sugarman the importance of external presures and the role of crisis in initiating change in large organizations ilustrating the cocktail of internal and external presures that produces strategic organizational change the transformation proces implies that the system would go beyond present forms since emergent forms rarely are clear it is imposible to specify the exact nature of the transformational change except to sugest that it generaly tends to produce systems with higher level of structure that can encompas and manage the expanded system greater simplicity general that increases the eficiency of the operation higher levels of consciousnes self reflective alowing the system to se its own functioning more clearly and therefore alows for more harmonious orchestration betwen al components of the system elgin bushnel in this sense it is the incorporation of changes important organizational aspects in the strategic management proceses of the organization digital transformation in heis deployment model which led to greater emphasis on macro or holistic view of organizational change ferlie et al in other words the second order change is change multidimensional radical organizational multini vel qualitative discontinuous that involves paradigm shift amir uri it is significant to highlight that organizational transformation is defined as the work of facilitate fundamental change in organizations and promote paradigmatic change sugarman when the organization belief system no longer explains the in reality nor does it help shape policies and operations the organization goes through crisis in this situation dominant coalitions tend to adhere to the old paradigm to increase centralization and to cal for going back to basics these actions they depen the crisis until turning point is reached in that case the organization either stops functioning or sudenly jumps to higher order and new paradigm with new vision of the world new organizational philosophy beliefs values structure policies and operations amir uri as adams points out organizational transformation means change in both thought and action as more fundamental level that has ben achieved so far by most of the change agents the author lewin cited by pérez valejo et al describes organizational transformation as modification of the forces that maintain the behavior of stable system so said behavior is product of two types of forces those that help change to take place driving forces and those who resist the change from ocuring restrictive forces who want maintain the status quo they also propose the change in thre phases the first of them is the thaw the motivation for change is created or its ned is evident movement can ocur through the asimilation of new information the exposure of new concepts or the development of diferent perspective and refrezing or stabilization of change calderón hernández et al later schein aded that to the unfrezing stage thre sub proceses discusion of the expectations induction of the desire for learning which ocurs once the the validity and relevance of the facts initialy discused and provision of security psychological which converts anxiety into motivation for change calderón hernández et al finaly change ocurs through cognitive restructuring in the which words are redefined concepts are interpreted more broadly or they learn new standards of evaluation and judgment calderón hernández et al chapter theoretical framework on the other hand the authors amir uri propose evolutionary change by distinguishing five general stages stage planed organizational change and development changes in the environment and in the organization adaptation eforts by development step by step changes step into the curent belief system purpose and mision stage awarenes incremental and minor changes canot provide satisfactory solutions there is cal to go back to basics and to stick to the old mudle through crisis stage creating readines for change facilitating the new new things emerge ideas in the periphery and they spread or new leadership sugests new vision and direction dificulties for informal legitimation stage creating energy for change creating an open space the new ideas are subject to campaigns and political conflicts the eforts for formal legitimation result in suden change and aceptance of the new order paradigm stage facilitate the transition new ideas are translated into norms regulations procedures and structures development of the mechanism socialization digital transformation in institutions higher education digital transformation is the dep and acelerated transformation of the activities of the busines proceses competencies and models to make the most of the changes and oportunities provided by digital technologies and their impact on society in strategic and priority way demirkan et al aditionaly it is defined as complex organizational transformation that aligns in holistic harmonious and strategic aproach agile and flexible proceses people information suported by curent and emerging technologies castro benavides et al so likewise the author teichert defines digital transformation as proces of change disruptive or incremental it begins with the adoption and use of digital technologies then digital transformation in heis deployment model evolves towards an implicit holistic transformation of an organization by becoming in paradigm of change the digital transformation underlined by the fourth revolution industrial is surounding the universities and presuring them in turn to transform in order to comply with new social requirements therefore only change in the organizational paradigm can generate high performance furthermore each paradigm shift neds to be anticipated by change in the strategies and methods to facilitate the next level of paradigm shift like in the kuhn theory of scientific revolutions paradigms or organizational frameworks they nest inside each other each new paradigm is an extension of the old one providing broader frame of reference in which both coexist amir uri digital transformation generates changes in vision and meaning impacting culture imersed in the university the administrative and training activities its evaluations pedagogical aproaches teaching research extension and administration as wel as the people imersed in it it not just about what universities invest in technology it about how they use this investment and how new leadership makes digital transformation sucesful the transformation digital not only atempts to measure the extent to which an organization is able to benefit of the use of technologies but is also sen as an evolutionary proces through which technologies become fundamental element of their daily lives afecting al dimensions that involve both people and the organization itself rodríguez abitia bribiesca corea that is digital transformation must be comprehensive and holistic transformation and must be aproached from perspective technological organizational and social castro benavides et al in this context the changes that have ocured within universities are evident in diferent scenarios such as teaching infrastructure curiculum administration research and extension busines proceses resources humans governance of digital transformation information and digital marketing castro benavides et al this diversity makes it understandable as castro sumarizes benavides et al that within higher education institutions the digital transformation has ben aproached from diferent perspectives organizational socio cultural and technological the importance of perspective is notablechapter theoretical framework organizational because companies that wish to progres in the transformation must start from the top gurbaxani dunkle as wel as link four main subdimensions busines proceses administration information and governance of digital transformation sumarizes castro benavides et al for another side from the socio cultural perspective the worldview culture and competencies digital technologies of students teachers administrators stakeholders are vital in the proces of digital transformation because organizational change is related to people proceses strategies structures and competitive dynamics is where they reside most of the chalenges and oportunities wade becoming task that it must be faced with dep sensitivity and atention to overcome the natural resistance to change of the diferent dependencies or departments faria nóvoa finaly from the technological perspective where digital technologies exist cros border technologies iot devices printing and big data analysis drive transformations that go far beyond the optimizations of internal proceses since that can induce drastic changes in busines models organizational culture and corporate and industry wide structures nadkarni prügl as consequently the university must provide flexible technologies new platforms busines and an operational backbone is solid and scalable as part of agile digital infrastructure nadkarni prügl to suport the busines model human resources misionary proceses teaching extension and research as wel as inovation administrative proceses aces to information new markets always focusing on the user as the center of development castro benavides et al maturity levels of transformation digital the dynamic and evolutionary nature of digital transformation takes place in the universities while they are impacted by technology this proces of evolution is defined by proposals of digital maturity understanding it as the state of the digital transformation of company and the description of what company has already achieved in terms of carying out transformation eforts although there is no aproach standard to describe digital maturity levels teichert the author idc infodoc defines that transformation proces must incorporate several states of digital transformation in heis deployment model maturity these eforts could include changes that are achieved from point of view operational as wel as acquired meta skils regarding the mastery of the change chanias hes from content perspective the dimensions typical covers the strategic aspects of transformation management the core of the busines that includes the ofer of digital products and services the digitalization of internal proceses and operations digital interaction with the customer as wel as the use and it development chanias hes from an organizational context it refers to the meta rules that shape the organization rules and actions and give them meaning new directions and options must be created for the organization amir uri these models are particularly relevant when both metacapabilities in terms transformation management as technology driven changes in products proceses or busines models must be considered from perspective holistic chanias hes table describes the maturity levels of the diferent model proposals most relevant digital transformation found in the literature table maturity levels of diferent transformation model proposals digital found in the literature digital maturity

individual and the first resources to but do not use or exploit the intention to develop benefits obtained cary out activities oportunities ofered by the digitalization strategy is not always digital in adition it is advanced means on the one hand absolutely this is type that extends to the rest of the the reason for this may be that traditional organization departments and at first experiments are unaware of the posibilities it is dificult for them to cary out corporation with products and new technologies changes in digital services proceses digital are skeptical about busines management may not respect them or have be directed to administer started to use them modern organization inefective way on the other hand staf may not have company could also the necesary skils chose to be

management has type of measurable and operational leadership thinking the digital potential in that leads the organization to activities and proceses suces the organization has digital transformation in heis deployment model the necesary technical base plants are used the employes have the maximum skils and competencies necesary to work with she after analyzing the literature on diferent digital maturity models and their levels the folowing levels of digital maturity were consolidated in educational institutions superior no degre the university lacks defined objectives and transformation

administrators suport staf have the required digital skils resistance to change does not persist digital culture has ben internalized university it has the necesary technology to achieve digital transformation very high degre the university is very inovative and disruptive through the use of technology and new busines models the university flows naturaly in the new digital paradigm the university is always evaluating new technologies and its posible aplication proceses are automated and data analysis is used advanced for decision making it is an inteligent and visionary university he staf students teachers administrators are imersed in new culture digital perspectives on digital transformation digital transformation generates changes in meaning afecting the culture imersed in the administrative and training activities of the university its evaluations aproaches pedagogical teaching research extension and administration proceses as wel as the people imersed in it it does not refer only to the investment that universities do in technology but also how they use this investment and make the leadership changes necesary for sucesful digital transformation to ocur for another on the other hand digital transformation not only atempts to measure the extent to which an organization is able to benefit from the use of it but is also sen as an evolutionary proces digital transformation in heis deployment model through which it becomes fundamental element of your daily life afecting al dimensions that involve both people and the organization itself rodríguez abitia bribiesca corea the radical and rapid changes that require internaly and in the environment make the importance of managing this type of change is extremely significant for the survival and suces of the organization the author tichy argues that thre diferent perspectives coexist in organizational theory and practice representing diferent ways of explaining the organizational technical political and cultural reality the technical paradigm is greatly limited measure to organize the most efective way to get the job done the political paradigm includes theories of exchange conflict power and coalition problems and alocation of rewards and limits its scope to political aspects finaly the cultural paradigm it restricts much of its scope to cultural aspects tichy sugests integrating the thre previous perspectives in higher level organizational paradigm than encompases everything on the other hand the authors gurbaxani dunkle expres that the transformation digital requires useful framework that encompases strategic technological of human capital and organizational culture furthermore interventions that aim to facilitating paradigm shift must include changes not only in the purpose of the organization but also in its thre basic subsystems otherwise the change wil not it wil remain from this perspective second order change interventions should aim to change not only the values norms atitudes structures and technology but also the power structure gurbaxani dunkle the digital transformation in higher education institutions requires rethinking restructure and reinvent from its multipurpose multiproces nature multidisciplinary multistate and multiactor it colective efort tive that places the person at the center of the proces of development transformation and impact on society that is to say digital transformation must be comprehensive and holistic transformation of institutions of higher education and must be aproached from technological perspective organizational and social castro benavides et al in the folowing paragraphs wil describe these perspectives chapter theoretical framework organizational perspective the importance of the organizational perspective in the proces of digital transformation of higher education institutions this section consolidates the specific dimensions that the researchers have selected separately in relationship with this perspective resulting in the emergence of four subdimensions information administration busines proces and governance of the digital transformation mat et al rosing etzel castro benavides et al information dimension inf mancini law states organizations are information network systems they only work efectively when there are clear and predictable information flows within and betwen these networks today more than ever busines proceses are interconected and content information is key in an increasing number of proceses scop the dimension of information in digital transformation is very valuable aset and information is at the very center of that transformation by which must be aligned and consistent with the busines architecture of the institutions of higher education castro benavides et al the information or content or data is key suces factor in adition to human factors leadership proceses the organization etc which also require information scop with in order to enrich the internal proces of strategic formulation and implementation the data acquired from various sources can be optimized to plan the busines of more agile and efective way on the other hand under curent conditions the materials educational materials are created in digital formats and have become the key facilitator of online education sandhu thoring et al grab et al the universities should improve the use of data and information in al proceses of decision suport whether at an operational or strategic level alowing decisions to be made based on real data faria nóvoa furthermore for the sucesful implementation of digital transformation data governance must be considered as noted abdulfatah almaghthawi including security agrements and protection data and regulations rodrigues also as proposed by castro benavides et al the information must be aligned consistently with the architecture digital transformation in heis implementation model ation busines of higher education institutions to ensure the efective management of data transformation and digital adoption of the busines busines proces dimension proc digital transformation being an organizational transformation alows the university create improve and reinvent operational proceses as wel as replace traditional services with digital services that simplify proceses involved in the provision of services reducing operational complexity castro benavides et al busines proces optimization is the optimization of individual busines proceses within that holistic perspective and this is what coresponds to customer centric optimization neds the clients and stakeholders they should not se silos or internal divisions in the proceses simply interact with organizations in the context of busines proces and the result that interaction is what they want to se scop the changes which are found largely in the busines proces they induce changes in other proceses strategies and the company as whole krel gale for example university digitization of administrative proceses provides unrestricted hour aces to the entire information and services using multiple platforms or digital curicula rodrigues likewise the digital services ofered at the level of educational institutions superior facilitate comunication colaboration and co creation of value in al stakeholders castro benavides et al on the other hand proces automation busines and data digitization can increase agility in busines institutions higher education but also significantly increase the risks of cybersecurity and threat levels rodrigues from the point of view of the teaching the modernization of study plans is promoted to satisfy the contemporary educational standards and methods which sek to update the program educational without the bariers of time and space as wel as the development of international studies the search for new ways of delivering content through digital learning and the expansion of the use of ict technologies alowing flexible response to the neds of the labor market castro benavides et al over time for universities the ir stem curiculum wil ned to focus on emerging technologies robotics ai iot nanomaterials genomics and biotechnology to provide workforce not only capable of developing new aplications andchapter theoretical framework products but also capable of interpreting the efects of these technologies on the society and use their training to provide sustainable and ethical uses of science and technology penprase dimension administration admn there are strategies that change the content and thus improve the curent situation by on the other hand there are strategies that change the context creating new trajectories and options for the organization amir uri transformation strategies digital acquire the second perspective they focus on the transformation of products proceses and organizational aspects due to new technologies mat et al digital transformation understands that structural changes must be caried out therefore leadership and suport from top management are required the source of change is within the organization the decision making proces begins with the emergence of asumptions from new perspective this change is trigered by management behavior decision making proceses decision making and strategic planing management in digital world requires rethinking strategies of the company busines models and key busines drivers for suces gurbaxani dunkle requires method that changes the entire context of the problem and open new projections for the organization amir uri to aply digital transformation in higher education institutions it is required that the rectorate is aware that digital transformation is promoted through decisions and strategies at the busines level sandhu and that recognizes the heterogeneity of proceses and practices that wil improve the overal eficiency of the university as whole faria nóvoa the authors amir uri citing to meyer advised that structure which is initialy an acomodation to environment eventualy becomes an impediment to change and must be altered fundamentaly this means that organizational hierarchies are wil flaten as employes gain more autonomy and participate in decision making organizational decisions schwarzmüler et al on the other hand it is necesary for it busines leaders to direct the proceses of busines renginering retrain people transform services implementing digital initiatives in an integrated maner and managing the implementation of digital transformation in heis deployment model digital transformation related to changes in it infrastructure and its services castro benavides et al dolganova aditionaly the leaders of the entire company must know and stay up to date with digital trends implications of those trends and how to take advantage of new technologies harvard busines review analytic services in this sense the executive team must have the ability to define and lead digital transformation strategy with team of strong specialized leadership who can confidently explain and implement the transformation digital in the institution castro benavides et al strategic planing dimension plan the strategic choices made by leaders are esential to understanding how organizations adapt to the environment amir uri with respect to digital transformation requires wel planed digital strategy roadmap clear including the digital transformation framework in which al key actors and stakeholders can play an active role in shaping university that thrives in the digital age goble sandhu for example in world digital companies must continualy align their busines structures with the new technologies to benefit from standardization and automation fischer et al the importance of strategic alignment and governance is evident in the ned to establish digital strategy and ensure agility colaboration and digital experience fischer et al among the most important tasks to do operational the roadmap is alignment with the leadership team the digital director cdo as wel as misionary operational leaders and the implementation of resources necesary to comply with it mckinsey company in transformation proces digital alignment and colaboration must flow betwen management and purchasing teams digital and busines units fischer et al on the other hand changes are costly therefore the development of proceses that alow minimizing the cost of change tece et al some authors mention the importance of having budget reserved for digital transformation bendor that is digital transformation requires large investments to get rid of the past and adopt new and disruptive technologies as wel as the suport of adequate resources it infrastructure financing and personel castro benavides et al chapter theoretical framework socio cultural perspective cult the worldview culture and digital skils of the comunity university students teachers administrative staf and stakeholders are vital in the digital transformation proces in al organizations including universities since organizational change is related to people proceses strategies structures and competitive dynamics is where the most of the chalenges and oportunities wade to understand the transformation of systems perhaps first conceptual transformation is neded that alows people se the proces of social change diferently if the systemic evolution were sen as dynamic proces it would be easier to se the objective of the change of the social systems not as the creation of static final state but as proces continuous of human and social growth this means that instead of trying to stop the growth of social system at particular stage people would strive to participate openly and fuly in the natural and inevitable proces of the evolution of the social systems elgin bushnel consequently it is important to consider the change management as necesary strategy for the suces of digital transformation in higher education institutions castro benavides et al this is one task that must be aproached with dep sensitivity and atention to overcome resistance natural to change faria nóvoa to the extent that something is highly institutionalized wil have strong cultural persistence lawrence furthermore the ability to adapt quickly to change is also highlighted as important capacity experts have said that agility is more important than technological skils the st century is about agility adjustment adaptation and creation of new oportunities bondar et al to ensure the sustainability of the transformation companies rely on an open culture that facilitates creativity and risk taking fischer et al the human capacity for creative thinking creative behavior and inovation is an important source of change organizational this perspective is the most compatible with the choice perspective strategic or management the source of change is in the system and capabilities unique abilities of people to be inovative and creative amir uri an organizational transformation wil be sucesful with competent people who realy understand the meaning and complexity of digitalization and the talent available in the digital transformation in heis deployment model company to suport it gurbaxani dunkle at the university the capabilities digital hr are the key enabler of digital transformation university through the competent digital workforce and are the capabilities that enable someone to live learn and work in digital society sandhu that is highly profesional workforce with digital skils

schwarzmüler et al emphasizing that inovations in digital teaching are not only technical inovations but also academic curicular organizational and structural inovations in this sense it is perceived that the use of digital educational resources alows new roles for teachers and students creating flexible and motivating ways of learning and being more autonomous and colaborative fleacă this is how the teacher training unit becomes an important player in the digital transformation proces due to the important chalenge of digital literacy among al actors that requires them update your skils in the field globaly the principles of education in the areas of customization flexible design and integration of various trajectories educational and labor castro benavides et al technological and physical infrastructure perspective tec the fourth industrial revolution is often described as the result of integration and the combined efects of multiple exponential technologies such as inteligence artificial inteligence ai biotechnologies and nanomaterials penprase the transformations that ocured within the busineses were focused mainly on the introduction of internal management information systems such as planing enterprise resources erp or customer relationship management crm today in day in adition to these transformations the university must provide flexible it new busines platforms

properly aligning the objectives organizational with the implementation and use of it rodríguez abitia bribiesca corea on the other hand the university must have physical infrastructure to met contemporary educational standards and methods institutes of inovation teaching laboratories digital training units buildings laboratories for teaching in acordance with digital and inovation scenarios castro benavides et al an example is presented by hula et al when raising the creation of inovation institutes as very important infrastructure resource where case study based training laboratories can operate empirical study design this chapter adreses the aspects related to the design of the empirical study starting with the description of the theoretical model and hypotheses also it is described the proces that was caried out to validate the content of the measuring instrument of digital transformation in higher education institutions absent in the literature and leveraged on the theoretical arc and analysis caried out in chapter the proces of submision to content validation caried out by experts also detailed in this chapter this measuring instrument wil be aplied to obtain the information and subsequent evaluation of the relationships betwen the diferent perspectives organizational socio cultural and technological and the maturity of digital transformation in

higher education institutions implementation model design and validation of content transformation measuring instrument digital in education institutions superior validity comonly acepted definition of the validity of an instrument is the extent to which the instrument measures what it purports to measure slocumb cole it is also considered vital factor in the selection or aplication of an instrument zamanzadeh et al and serves as guide to determine the apropriate implications of the study findings slocumb cole specificaly validity is determined by examining concepts related to construct criterion and content validity devon block moyle wright et al construct validity refers to how wel an instrument identifies measures corect operationalizations for the theoretical concepts under study sampieri et al yin the criterion validity of measurement instrument is established by comparing its results with those of certain external criterion that tries to measure the same sampieri digital transformation in heis implementation model et al and finding statisticaly significant relationship betwen measure and criterion rubio et al and content validity refers to the degre to which the items of an instrument are representative sample of the content domain being measured escura devon block moyle wright et al magdalena et al zamanzadeh et al content validity content validity reveals ful range of the atribute under study devon block moyle wright et al in terms of clarity coherence relevance and suficiency of the dimension item with respect to content domain carbajal tamari to develop set of scale items researcher first defines the construct of interest and its dimensions searching the literature through opinions of experts carying out population sampling or through qualitative research devon block moyle wright et al on the other hand content validity can be characterize as face validity or logical validity face validity indicates that the measure apears to be valid at first glance logical validity indicates more proces rigorous focused on an evaluation provided by expert judges so that information can be provided about the representativenes and clarity of the elements and ofer concrete sugestions to improve the quality of the instrument rubio et al zamanzadeh et al if experts in the field are perceived as true experts it is unlikely that there is higher authority that questions the asumption validity of the test content lawshe in sumary escobar pérez cuervo martínez sugests the folowing categories to evaluate the validity of content of measuring instrument suficiency clarity coherence relevance and the rating scale does not met criteria low level moderate level high level finaly numerous analytical techniques have ben proposed to quantify the degre of agrement of experts on the relevance of the content of an instrument among the most used are aiken coeficient aiken the validity index of lawshe content cvi lawshe the content validity index cvr and the content validity coeficient cvc hernandez nieto and pedrosa et al detail other techniques the main ones are described below chapter design of the empirical study of aiken aiken coeficient is considered the most relevant statistic to evaluate validity of content escura evaluate the relevance of each item with respect to its construct but also considers not only the number of categories ofered to the judges but the number of participating experts aditionaly the ratings asigned they can be dichotomous values of or or polychotomous values of to pedrosa et al the statistic is calculated using equation where represents the median of the judges ratings represents the value lowest posible and represents the range of posible values within the scale of measurement used the statistic provides an index that goes from to we obtain value of equal to when al judges select the lowest posible score and value of equal to when al judges select the highest score posible penfield giacobi furthermore the result can be evaluated statisticaly using the table in the right tail of asociated probabilities and acepting as valid only the elements which are statisticaly significant at as shown in table if there are nine judges and four scale levels an aiken of should be obtained for statistical significance level of and for the item to be considered valid escura table right tailed probabilities for validity coeficient values adapted from aiken number of rating categories no items or qualifications digital transformation in heis deployment model furthermore the calculation of the confidence intervals for this coeficient alows us contrast whether the magnitude obtained from the coeficient is greater than that established as minimaly aceptable to conclude the content validity of the items juárez hernández tobón the confidence interval for aiken can be calculated with equations and where refers to the lower limit and to the uper limit of score confidence interval for 𝑛𝑘𝑉 𝑛𝑘𝑉 𝑛𝑘 𝑛𝑘𝑉 𝑛𝑘𝑉 𝑛𝑘 in equations and coresponds to the standard value of the normal distribution such that the of the distribution area is betwen and for example for an interval of confidence penfield giacobi lawshe content validity index cvi lawshe content validity index cvi determines quantitative index for measure the content validity of an instrument the index requires that expert judges evaluate whether the skil or knowledge measured by the item is esential useful but not esential or not necesary for the performance of their job lawshe the cvi is the average of the values of the items retained by aplying the validity relationship of the content cvr proposed by lawshe the formula to calculate the cvr is 𝐶𝑉𝑅 𝑛𝑒 when the number of expert judges who agre with the category esential and the total number of expert judges lawshe presents this expresion to be interpreted as corelation since he takes values from to then cvr wil be negative if les than half of the judges are agre cvr is nul if exactly half of the participants agre and cvr is positive if more than half agre magdalena et al chapter empirical study design aditionaly table explained by lawshe presents the values cvr minimums with single tailed test as content validity coeficient cvc the content validity coeficient cvc is an index that measures the validity of content based on agrement betwen judges the author hernandez nieto recomends the participation of thre to five expert judges and the use of likert scale of five alternatives it is calculated with the average of one of the items betwen the maximum score that could obtain the item consequently the eror asigned to each element is calculated pe the formula to calculate cvc is yo cvc cvc pe likewise it recomends keping only those items with coeficient greater than while balbinoti in juárez hernández tobón sugests keping those items with coeficient greater than the cvc evaluation scale is presented in table table cvc evaluation scale values interpretation to not aceptable to very low to low to moderately low to god to excelent in the content validity of the instrument the agrement of the judges must be in the uper range of the scale hernandez nieto zamanzadeh et al consensus betwen the judges an equivalent phrase for consensus general agrement might be the colective opinion of group considering that certain degre of variation is posible betwen individuals wiliam tastle wierman on the other hand disent is defined as diference of opinion so that conflict ocurs within the group involved in making decision wiliam tastle wierman digital transformation in heis deployment model within the context of content validation if revisions are required important to the measurement of the instrument the researcher can repeat the proces rubio et al when the result of the agrement measure is high it indicates that there is consensus in the proces of clasification or asignment of scores among evaluators equaly nte acounts for the interchangeability of measuring instruments and reproducibility of the measure escobar pérez cuervo martínez there are several techniques to determine this agrement including kapa statistics bernal garcía et al escobar pérez cuervo martínez hernandez nieto kendal escobar pérez cuervo martínez zamora de ortiz et al and wierman tastle wierman kapa statistician this statistic generates measure of agrement it is only used in nominal data without however there is generalization to include ordinal data caled coeficient weighted escobar pérez cuervo martínez the statistic has range betwen and but generaly lies betwen and if the coeficient is it indicates perfect agrement betwen the evaluators if it is it indicates that the agrement is not greater than that expected by the random and if the value of the coeficient is negative the level of agrement is lower than expected by randomnes escobar pérez cuervo martínez kapa values greater than indicate excelent agrement those betwen and are defined as aceptable agrement and values below are they consider agrement por or unaceptable hernandez nieto for him on the contrary cortés reyes et al sugest another interpretation por or weak for kapa values below moderate for values betwen and god betwen and and very god for higher kapa values up to kendal kendal is non parametric rank test that indicates the degre of asociation level of agrement betwen the average ranges of the evaluations made by judges experts acording to an ordinal scale zamora de ortiz et al an interpretation of kendal is presented in table chapter design of the empirical study table interpretation of kendal taken from schmidt kendal interpretation clasification very weak consensus none low weak consensus moderate consensus moderate strong high consensus exceptionaly strong consensus very high tastle wierman consensus the tastle wierman consensus is measure of dispersion used to determine the consensus and disent the measure is aplied to likert scale or any scale ordinal with this measure data on ordinal scales can be given value of dispersion that is logicaly and theoreticaly sound tastle wierman vilaverde kosheleva the minimum value that the coeficient asumes is and the maximum es the authors wiliam tastle wierman have not defined parameters for interpret this index therefore they are interpreted in the same way as kendal the average ratings for each item are also used to calculate the ranking end of ful round okoli pawlows ki the practical aplications of this index can be consulted in studies such as vilaverde kosheleva tastle wierman expert judgment the first objective of content validity is to obtain the opinion of expert judges who suport or reject the apropriate operational definition of the variables within the universe of conceptual content and reach consensus to achieve this goal they have proposed various consensus methods such as group methods or by unique expert methods you can folow among others the agregate method individual the delphi method the nominal group technique and the group consensus method coral among the individual techniques is the agregate method individual and the delphi method both require interaction with experts but in the later higher level of agrement is required escobar pérez cuervo martínez likewise if used systematicaly and rigorously this method can contribute significantly to expand knowledge hason et al this study folows the delphi method detailed below digital transformation in heis deployment model delphi method the prospective delphi method consists of technique for obtaining information based in consulting experts in an area in order to obtain consensus opinion and reliable lópez vidal africa calvo although in the literature exact number of judges it is recomended to have group of at least five people to have suficient control over the agrement each judge caries out the evaluation of the quantitative and qualitative opinions on the items after analyzing their answers the research team sends the resulting median to each judge requesting that reconsider validate your judgment until you reach consensus escobar pérez cuervo martínez zamanzadeh et al to verify the consensus reached in the responses the use of the coeficient is sugested of tastle wierman consensus when consensus there is god agrement and the round ends expert competence coeficient one way to select experts is through the analysis of their relevance as experts by calculating the expert competence coeficient mengual andrés et al using formula is the knowledge or information coeficient that represents measure of the level of knowledge on the subject the judge self asesment is required on discrete scale from to and then multiplied by is the argumentation

non experimental descriptive study during the proces colected the qualitative and quantitative points of view of expert judges regarding the research topic folowing the methodology proposed by hason et al study design web based delphi proces was developed to involve expert judges and validate the content of the measurement instrument with respect to the implementation of the digital transformation in higher education institutions the steps were folowed preparation of instructions and spreadshets comitment with experts delphi method and colection and analysis of results preparation of instructions and spreadshets prior to developing the instrument review of the literature was caried out that alowed identify twenty nine items grouped mainly into four dimensions twelve of them belonging to the organizational perspective seven belonging to the socio cultural perspective five that represent the technological perspective and five related to the maturity of the digital transformation in higher education institutions se anex digital transformation in heis deployment model subsequently so that the information was colected in an operable form the items were adjusted and organized in an apropriate format and sequence zamanzadeh et al furthermore the instructions to the judges about the dimensions and the indicator that measures each item or group of items were explained in detail through video cover leter and writen documents sugested by escobar pérez cuervo martínez finaly the study respected ethical considerations such as aceptance permision to use and safeguard the information provided by the judges experts selection of experts delphi method the sample selection was non probabilistic purposeful and critical taherdost et al acording to the interest in participating in the study knowledge about the topic of digital transformation in higher education institutions experience and availability some experts were contacted through emails electronic available in the diferent scientific articles on digital transformation and others recognized experts in diferent countries initialy list of thirty five was designed two potential judges each of whom received cover leter and invitation to take part in the evaluation trial eleven judges acepted it was requested to the expert judges who responded to the self asesment that mets the requirements described in section to calculate the expert competence coeficient finaly the nine experts with rating greater than preparation the proces was created with criterion of seking the participation of expert judges from diferent geographical regions and with heterogeneous experience the delphi method consisted of total of nine judges four doctors five systems enginers or electricians who serve as profesors deans or directors of inovation in higher education institutions the group of experts also reflected diversity of opinions with varied geographical representation of the countries from colombia spain portugal guatemala and germany chapter design of the empirical study the role of the expert judges was to review these indicators and establish the level of agrement on the relevance coherence clarity and suficiency of each item with respect to the construct to which it belongs data colection the survey was conducted through the surveymonkey web aplication the delphi method is tok place betwen october and november it began with the formal invitation to be part of the group of expert judges while the information about the design of the study and the link to enter the website was sent to them by email he asked the judges who acepted the invitation to respond within thre weks after receiving the email it is worth mentioning that comunication and evaluation by the experts ocured asynchronously up to two were sent reminders to participants who did not complete the survey within the specified time frame and finaly the survey was closed after two months with very significant contributions complete and detailed information provided by the nine judges the survey included four sections the first contained information about the study and the self asesment required to calculate the coeficient the second concerned data identification of the future evaluator the third described the main characteristics and dimensions of the university with their respective items along with the details of the characteristics of each construct scientific relevance and indicators to rate each item finaly the fourth section colected information from the judges self asesment to calculate the argumentation coeficient furthermore each the section ofered fields to fre text for observations that the judges would like to expres in this round and for each indicator the experts had to indicate their agrement or disagrement on level likert type scale not compliant low level moderate level high level acording to suficiency clarity coherence and relevance the analysis was caried

provided by the judges specificaly aiken escura and the tastle consensus coeficient wierman tastle wierman consensus betwen judges tastle wierman consensus tastle wierman consensus value greater than or equal to would indicate that strong consensus and the expert round would be finalized however if the value is les the survey must be sent again to the expert judges starting new iteration in each iteration the folowing information would be returned for each item the average item rating for judges the qualification that the judge gave him to the item in the previous round an indication of the curent level of consensus based on the tastle wierman consensus coeficient value and paragraph sumarizing the coments from other participants about why they evaluated that item with base in this participants review and or adjust their ratings for each item with their respective observations okoli pawlowski or aiken the modifications made to the items by the researchers are made based on the observations of the expert judges and the results of aiken considering that the item is maintained if the value of aiken is greater than or equal to otherwise it is modified or deleted the desired result is trend towards and new rounds can be caried out if in the first round the minimum value of is not reached in the judges agrement nor value greater than in aiken coeficient with statistical

dimensions coherence relevance clarity suficiency al dimensions ci ci ci ci ci organizational socio cultural technological dt maturity in response to fedback provided by experts changes were made qualitative in the wording of the questions and some of the context was modified to finalize the design of the questionaire in conclusion the study of the validity of an instrument is costly proces that it requires time to plan and execute in that order the first critical step to caried out must be the study of content validity because this analysis verifies that the instruments used for the studies are apropriate for the onstruct the population being investigated and the socio cultural context in which the study is imersed since content validity is prerequisite for other types of validity it must have top priority during the development of the instrument in content validity studies researchers can receive information invaluable from expert judges who provide constructive fedback on the quality of the newly developed measures and the objective criteria with which they must evaluate each element rubio et al consequently the analysis of the consolidated results of the instrument through the aiken and consensus coeficients indicates that the instrument has content validity and that there is strong consensus among the judges therefore second round was not required on the contrary values that do not exhibited statistical significance in their content validity and or had values lower than in the consensus coeficient were carefuly reviewed by the chapter design of the empirical study researchers and reflecting the observations provided by the expert judges the wording and context to facilitate understanding of the item acepting the sugestion of the expert judges items and of the technological dimension were merged into single item consequently the evaluation of the instrument described in this work facilitates obtaining of scientificaly valid and reliable results to validate the relationships betwen the constructs organizational socio cultural and technological that impact the transformation digital in higher education institutions castro

redundant which reduces construct validity al latent variable measures indicate reliability of internal consistency in the measurement model se table convergent validity the metric used to evaluate the convergent validity of construct is the average variance extracted ave for al items of each construct an aceptable ave is or higher which establishes that more than of the chapter results of the

coeficient of determination which represents the predictive power of the sample because it is the squared corelation of the actual and predictive values likewise must calculate the redundancy and comunality index using stone cros validation gleiser this measure is an indicator of predictive power that measures how wel they are reconstructed the values by the model and its estimated parameters and the significance and relief statistical analysis of the path coeficients hair et al that analyzes the relationships betwen the constructs through the values obtained from the coeficients standardized paths aditionaly researchers should evaluate the predictive power outside chapter results of the empirical study of their model sample using the plspredict procedure described in shmueli et al before evaluating the structural relationships of the model colinearity must be examined this verification makes it posible to ensure that there are no biases in the results of the regresion hair et al although colinearity is evaluated betwen formative indicators in reflective models they are used to check if there are critical levels of colinearity betwen the sets of predictor variables therefore the values of the variance inflation factor vif hair et al colinearity vif values above are indicative of posible problems of colinearity betwen the predictor constructs joseph hair et al al

of cult is explained by org and tec of the tec variability is explained by org specificaly of the variability in dt_madurez is given by cult tec and org se table from this criterion it can be said that the cult construct has substantial explanatory power and the proposed tec and dt_maturity constructs they have moderate explanatory power digital transformation in heis deployment model table coeficient of determination adjusted observation cult predictive power substantial dt_maturity predictive power moderate tec predictive power moderate predictive power another means of evaluating the predictive acuracy of the path pls model is calculate the value of this measure is based on the blindfolding technique which uses subset of the available data to estimate the model parameters and then predict mising data examines whether model acurately predicts data not used in estimating the model parameters noreña the smal ones diferences betwen predicted and original values results translate

conclusions firstly one of the main contributions of this work lies in confirming that digital transformation in higher education institutions must be adresed as an organizational transformation and in that sense be considered and aligned from thre diferent perspectives organizational socio cultural and technological to achieve synchronize digital transformation in holistic and evolutionary integration over the course weather secondly research aplied to public universities in colombia through the implementation model it shows that the digital transformation is presented progresively through maturity levels none low moderate high very high evidencing how this transformation generates changes in vision and meaning within higher education institutions impacting their culture policies administrative and training activities evaluation proceses pedagogical aproaches teaching research and extension proceses as wel as people imersed in she it is profound change that goes beyond the fact of introducing information technologies indus tria is paradigm shift thirdly from the descriptive analysis caried out it can be said that the majority of colombia public universities are located at level of maturity moderate which implies that for universities the digital transformation begins to be latent concern where they are analyzing their vision and considering making an internal change as wel as change in their university objectives in the medium term by on the other hand they are incorporating digitalization automation initiatives and digital user modifying some governance procedures curicula and or teaching pedagogies however stil do not focus on the disruptive potential digital transformation in heis deployment model of the transformation consequently the investment and use of new technologies becomes with precaution likewise it can be said that its staf students teachers administrative has moderate digital skils and there is stil evidence of resistance to change in the face of digital transformation proceses fourthly it is clear that without adequate conceptual development science could not proced beyond certain stage lewin as the motivation for this research some theoretical and practical implications are derived se figure figure implementation model of digital transformation in institutions of higher education from the analysis of the structural model in conclusion the organizational decisions directly impact the socio cultural and technological aspects and indirectly impact the maturity of digital transformation on the other hand they exhibit an impact positive from the technological perspective in the maturity levels of the transformation digital mediated by the socio cultural perspective likewise the organizational perspective influences the socio cultural and technological dimensions and only the socio cultural aspects they directly influence the maturity levels of digital transformation in this sense the present study makes contribution to the theory by providing evidence empirical evidence of the importance of integrating the organizational socio cultural and technology in order to improve the level of maturity of the digital transformation in the higher education institutions likewise it is confirmed that the decisions and organizational comitments information misionary proceses conclusions administration management and suport administration strategic planing from the high levels of university management have concrete impact on promotion within the maturity levels of digital transformation within the institutions of higher education aditionaly the results sugest that universities should consider injecting their digital transformation eforts into improving socio cultural strategies in place to maximize technology fifthly it is considered pertinent to highlight that this research achieved survey of the public universities in colombia that is universities that are dispersed throughout the national teritory result that alows you to have holistic view of the maturity of digital transformation in public universities in colombia finaly based on the previous reasoning we consider that the model of implementation created is relevant reference framework for universities since contributes to improving the understanding and management of digital transformation proceses that take place inside likewise it is worth highlighting the importance of the instrument of digital transformation proposed as diagnostic and planing tol posible projects for the development of digital transformation strategy as schematic visualization figure consolidates the most important elements important things that heis must take into acount to increase maturity levels in digital transformation proceses linking organizational perspectives socio cultural and technological as whole digital transformation in heis deployment model figure holistic view of digital transformation in heis future lines of research future refinements of the measurement instrument are sugested by aplying new variables moderators that have not ben considered in this study and that could help the understanding of complex resulting relationships for example geographic area date founding of the educational institution cultural context among others new research should focus on an update and analysis of the model of digital transformation of universities in the face of the new scenarios deployed in the period of the pandemic and post pandemic because this research focused its analysis in transition time that is before and during similarly at begining of the investigation it was established as the main basis for the identification of the void of knowledge and construction of the theoretical framework the systematic review of literature in scientific databases future research could integrate new perspectives from other sources of information such as reports from prestigious consulting firms international and or documented experiences of td proceses as wel as an analysisconclusions longitudinal transregional international evolution and prospective vision of the university framed in the context of digital transformation likewise based on the implementation model created it is sugested to generate new models that link the relationship of the third fourth and fifth helix through the digital transformation in universities it is proposed to cary out future studies that include the aplication of mixed methods of research that facilitate adresing broader research questions that provide beter understanding of digital transformation in heis research that measure for example the impact of digital transformation on the competitivenes of companies universities in the reduction of student dropout levels in the universities among others include private universities in the study and or expand its aplication to other countries which which would alow greater number of samples to contrast the results aplying cb sem leading to beter understanding of how these dimensions integrate and complement to guide digital transformation in educational institutions superior it would be very useful if each perspective organizational socio cultural and technological analyzed in this research became research unit so such that it can be depened in its theorization as wel as in concrete strategies for its evaluation and aplication limitations of the study proces instrument of measurement there are some limitations that ned to be noted first the instrument to measure digital transformation focused on higher education institutions being first instrument created new studies variables and or relationships could emerge particular to the contexts of each region country that have not ben considered and that may eventualy modify the relationships proposed in the model secondly the absence of previous studies that adres the isue of creation of instruments for measuring digital transformation in higher education institutions digital transformation in heis deployment model limits its comparative evaluation therefore there is ned to cary out aditional research to be improved later thirdly the creation of the model is directed to the context of the heis and the population the study only included public universities in colombia finaly it is important to clarify that the completion of the thesis work had diferent moments that included the analysis of literature until date on which publishes the article that is considered to date bibliographical reference in similar digital transformation work the creation of the aplied instrument later and which gave rise to the analysis of the context under study ies was created in the year and its aplication dates back to the year with conclusive data regarding the state of the art of digital transformation proceses in heis in reason to this our study and contribution to the knowledge

situation of closure of the rectory it is important to highlight significant results in terms of information management which were obtained from the implementation of two investment projects since and whose results per they aim to reflect clear contrast to the previous situation experienced inside our university as in many organizations information and data management in one it developed in silos that is in fragmented and cyclical absent from holistic and systemic perspective the above this was evident in the fact that technological solutions for the management of data and information as wel as its suporting guidelines and standards they emerged as responses to particular neds and problems without transversal government guidelines that would guarante its function nality and integration with other types of technological solutions after the implementation of the two investment projects rela related to phases and of data and information management so with general guidelines in the long medium and short term that have alowed us to gain maturity in the consolidation of data management and integrated information these guidelines are reflected in the policy ethics and the information management model regulatory documents constructed colectively among the relevant actors of the uni versity based on the joint work betwen the management ofice of information from the dned the

performance is related to the actual results of company or organization measured against planed goals or objectives businesdictionary acording to richard deviney yip johnson the performance organizational comprises thre specific result areas financial performance profits return on asets return on investment etc product market performance sales market share etc shareholder return total shareholder return value aded economic etc financial performance refers to measurements of operations and policies of an organization in monetary terms for example return on asets return on investment aded value among others market performance measures the performance of company or product in the market that is if market share has increased or if updates to product alow increased sales shareholder profitability establishes how much an organization enriches its shareholders also it can refer to the market capitalization of an organization in this way organizational performance involves its development strategic planers operations managers financial directors advisors legal businesmen owners of the organization among others in turn whiten keneth zelbst take as definition of performance organizational the average market share or share the average volume of sales and average sales growth indicators that reflect the degre to which digital transformation and organizational performance in companies in the healthcare sector electric power the organization performs beter than its competitors ashrafi keleher kuilboer whiten et al in cha cha to evaluate the organizational performance of company consider the folowing indicators that determine organizational performance value for money customer retention rate sales growth rate profitability of the company and general competitive position for its part in sklyar kowalkowski tronvol sörhamar the folowing criteria to measure organizational performance average return on investment average profit average return on sales average growth of market share average sales volume growth and growth average sales in dolars furthermore richard et al highlights organizational performance as one of the most important constructs in research management and management research related to stakeholders the heterogeneous circumstances of the products and time however this review shows that subjective perceptions related to the definition and various ways are used to its measurement these measures include various financial operation indices such as net earnings after taxes and capital returns and also measures of results in sucesful experiences it is concluded that there is lack of clarity of the theoretical definition of organizational performance and lack of consistency methodological in the formulation of constructs making scientific comparison dificult efective however organizational performance is not unidimensional theoretical construct nor is it likely that it can be characterized by single operational measure therefore the measures of organizational performance can vary acording to the domain of research and thus adopt its specific measures by discipline furthermore jenatabadi clasify organizational performance into six categories he initialy mentions etzioni concept penley gould which is based on the evaluation of compliance or not with the established objectives other researchers as chandler maintain that the final criterion of organizational performance is its long term growth and survival the improvement is established as primary objective continum of organizational performance and it is highlighted that the comon definitions are chapter theoretical framework the efectivenes or achievement of the objective in contrast it is sugested to measure performance organizational based on two factors that are adequately adjust the organization and their environments and god fit betwen the organization and its individual contributors by therefore the dimension of relevance or customer satisfaction is included in the definition jenatabadi aditionaly in jenatabadi the definition focused on means and ends is presented of the organization as social system with resources that can met the objectives laid out without incapacitating resources and compromising the wel being of employes where you can increase the productivity rates satisfaction levels and motivation of your employes colaborators maintaining low turnover rates costs and labor disturbances finaly the dimensions of efectivenes in the objectives of the organization eficiency in organizational resources and relevance in stakeholder satisfaction in the definition of organizational performance in adition some activities for performance measurement pm are mentioned which they alow busines management to excel through improving motivation monitoring performance improving comunication and diagnosing problems furthermore it alows you to identify and formulate improvements in management strategy next some proposed measurements are listed jenatabadi monitoring busines progres observe the progres of company with regarding the achievement of its established objectives through the supervision of the results monitoring the efect of the strategies and the plan through the results tests the impact and posibility of strategies and plans diagnosis based on the analysis of the results where these can show the failure symptoms and encourage the identification of its probable causes suport decision making pm alows an organization to search and identify the causes that have led to its suces and the potential posibilities that the company can use for further development pm ensures that decisions are made on facts rather than asumptions facilitation of motivation and comunication pm indicates the rate of progres of company and highlights its curent and future state of performance the motivation and pm clarity provide the company with an increase in the overal rate of operation including comunication betwen its staf and managers digital transformation and organizational performance in companies in the healthcare sector electric power structural equations model structural equation modeling in byrne the structural equation model is defined as methodology statistics that adopts the evaluation of hypothesis for the analysis of theory structural related to some phenomenon typicaly this theory represents proceses causals that generate observations in multiple variables in anderson gerbing highlights the potential of structural equation models for development of theories and the validation of constructs in areas such as psychology and social sciences for its part fornel larcker mentions that researchers have begun to demonstrate the advantages of these models with unobserved constructs for estimation of parameters and hypothesis testing in causal models bagozi yi defines structural equation models as procedures statistics for the measurement of functional predictive and causal tests and hypotheses gunasekaran et al focuses their research on the rbv management comitment and the difusion of inovation folowing the adoption of bda initiatives to develop and test model that explains the impact of bdpa big data and predictive analytics on the suply chain performance and organizational performance they consider the bdpa proces structured in thre stages aceptance routinization and asimilation aceptance refers to the perception of bdpa by the stakeholders of the organization routinization about how wel systems fit of governance of an organization to acomodate bdpa and asimilation to how wel has spread bdpa through the organizational proces acording to the proposed model they consider that conectivity resources and information exchange mediated by the efect of top management comitment tmc top management comitment help the asimilation of bdpa which impacts on suply chain performance and organizational performance for the achievement of competitive advantage se figure chapter theoretical framework figure model proposed in gunasekaran et al on the other hand merendino et al develop conceptual model using the theory based on knowledge to evaluate the value of bda this research model proves empiricaly propositions the study evaluates the value chain and begins to se how bda can leverage diferent forms of knowledge to create agility organizational bda technologies can provide agility organizational through the use of efective knowledge management determining that companies that poses organizational agility can achieve competitive advantage directly ha or indirectly through busines proceses hb the results obtained through the use of busines proceses wil afect the organization in general aditionaly they indicate that agility can also mediate the relationship betwen knowledge asets and performance ha ha as shown in figure digital transformation and organizational performance in companies in the healthcare sector electric power figure model proposed by côrte real et al in adrian abdulah atan jusoh model of the evaluation of implementation of big data analytics and the efect on decision making the model was developed based on thre dimensions the organization focused on carying out data strategy people through colaborative knowledge workers which refers to the skils of the analytical staf the organizational relationship and the culture analytics and the technological dimension for the execution of data analysis which includes the it infrastructures information procesing data governance and data quality management the efect of bdaia big data analytics implementation asesment influences the efectivenes of decision making as wel as the indirect efect of realizing the bda strategy the colaborative knowledge worker and the execution of data analysis factors as shown in figure another study of interest is the one presented by mishra luo hazen hasini foropon which proposes model to examine how it implementation the strategic flexibility of it the partnership betwen companies and big data and predictive analytics bdpa and alignment betwen companies and bdpa and resource capabilities humans afect organizational performance through bdpa based on the theory of resource based view chapter theoretical framework figure conceptual model for the evaluation of big busines analytics implementation data bdaia taken from adrian et al in the literature bdpa is proposed as dynamic capability and is put into consideration that the difusion of bdpa has implications for value creation organizational mishra et al the proposed model takes advantage of the capabilities of information technologies it and human resources to develop the capacity of bdpa which directly afects organizational performance organization performance op as shown in figure figure conceptual model proposed in mishra et al in conclusion structural equation modeling sem as form of modeling causal variables are comonly used to evaluate unobservable constructs variables latent through measurement model that defines constructs and establishes relationships betwen them it is frequently used in the social sciences due to its ability to impute relationships betwen unobservable constructs digital transformation and organizational performance in companies in the healthcare sector electric power these models develop hypothesis and implement measurement instruments with questions designed to measure the relationships betwen constructs acording to the initial hypothesis raised resource based theory view rbv the rbv maintains that organizations gain competitive advantage by creating sets of resources or strategic capabilities rbv focuses on internal resources of the company to identify asets capabilities and competencies with the potential to ofer competitive advantages jay barney ketchen wright rbv is considered compeling theory in it to theoreticaly and empiricaly evaluate the strategic value of organizational resources and establish relationships with busines variables this alows you to identify and categorize it resources establish suitable ways to unite and combine various resources and measure the efect of these resources gupta george wade huland in organizations it is important to ensure that resources are tangible within rbv in general resources can be clasified into tangible human abilities and types intangibles tangible resources are financial and physical resources in skils humans bring together knowledge and skils and intangibles are culture organizational and organizational learning gunasekaran et al gupta george merendino et al financial resources include debt equity retained earnings etc the resources physical include machines

management system of knowledge with an open aproach to foster knowledge flows this improves the development of internal knowledge management capacity and increases the inovation capacity of the company santoro vrontis thrasou dezi this capacity refers to the ability of an organization to explore and retain the internal and external knowledge within its own ecosystem with focus on open inovation that alows the creation of new products and proceses the management of knowledge identifies and leverages knowledge to foster proceses of inovation where functional and motivational factors are relevant to its suces santoro fiano bertoldi ciampi theory of dynamic capabilities dynamic capability theory dc the concept of dynamic capabilities was originaly used by tece pisano and shuen in which they defined as organization ability to integrate build and reconfigure internal and external competencies to quickly adres environments changing pisano tece shuen tece gary shuen amy for their part eisenhardt martin they relate the importance of capabilities dynamics in the adequate and timely adaptation to the changing environment through reconfiguration of proceses and resources both internal and external reconfiguration given from existing competencies considering data as an aset the capabilities in big data routines proceses and analysis and knowledge management from these data rialti et al this reconfiguration of proceses and resources is can ocur in planed maner through change management proceses based on the existing knowledge to generate competitive advantage rialti et al chapter theoretical framework makadok defines capabilities as subsets of company resources that they are not transfered the objective of which is to improve the productivity of other resources are capacities depend on the operating conditions of each organization the theory of dynamic capabilities arises from the perspective based on rbv and kbv as an efective theory for the field of strategic management for busines and management of ict this theory maintains that dynamic capabilities alow companies modify your resources to adapt quickly to changing conditions and maintain its competitive advantage rialti et al dc is made up of the ability to detect and configure oportunities and threats and maintain competitivenes through improvement combination protection and reconfiguration of tangible and intangible asets tece proposes dc to face new chalenges such as the ability ity of employes to learn and build new asets integrate strategic asets including capacity technology and customer requirements in proceses and the transformation or reuse of existing asets furthermore it is defined agility as dynamic capability where companies can identify and respond to threats and oportunities and quickly adjust their behaviors côrte real et al in mihardjo sasmoko alamsyah elidjen the dynamic ability sen by helfat peteraf and schoemaker as an improvement in vision resource based adresing problems with the routine proces in terms of resources proceses products and services that the organization neds to adapt in conclusion in this chapter the conceptual framework of the themes was developed related to digital transformation and organizational performance in order to have starting point for building the model in this review of concepts evidences close relationship betwen data the life cycle asociated with transformation digital and the proces of converting big data into information therefore it is considered the big data theory as one of the fundamental elements of digital transformation organizational transformation is presented under the ideas of fundamental change productivity discontinuous changes broad changes in the organizational entity and unexpected transitions proposals related to performance are presented organizational structure of companies through real and measured results regarding planed goals and objectives digital transformation and organizational performance in companies in the healthcare sector electric power in mes cases from the literature are presented that serve as input for the construction of the proposed model it is evident that the models found analyze simple relationships betwen few variables and the ned to formulate model that includes more variables which in turn integrate more elements inside in order to generate more complex model than those studied in the literature review the most recurent definitions of resource based theories are presented knowledge and dynamic capabilities alowing us to highlight that the models considered integrate these theories into their conceptual proposals furthermore you can conclude that the proposed model must be heterogeneous and include elements that asociate the thre theories and methodologies chapter systematic review of literature rsl this chapter aims to systematize the literature on digital transformation and organizational performance as methodology bibliometric analysis was caried out and review of the literature in articles extracted from the databases scopus web of science wos and ie xplore digital library search

information technologies management systems and impact cluster includes publications related to technology performance science of data information and knowledge management cluster groups publications on the specific aspects of organizations such as competitive advantages and analysis of data that makes posible the conection with the other clusters as wel as the inclusion of methodologies such as dynamic capabilities and resource based vision lastly the cluster integrates the management systems that generate an impact on the performance of the organization in figure emphasis is placed on organizational performance of which its direct relationship with big data and its articulation with the cluster of systems information technologies and management figure clusters by keywords emphasis on the relationship betwen big data and performance organizational grouped by year finaly figure presents the clusters discriminated by year of publication where it is posible to identify that the majority of the publications were made in in topics on data analytics competitive advantages and busines inteligence folowed digital transformation and organizational performance in companies in the healthcare sector electric power by those on dynamic capabilities technologies and their performance betwen and it is evident that the oldest publications year are related to the impact on organizations asociated with the use of information technologies and big data theories the systematic review of the literature includes the description and advances in thre theories diferent related to organizational performance and its relationship with transformation digital these include dynamic capabilities dc in order to find competitive advantages dc such as organizational agility is considered esential in gunasekaran et al conceptual model is proposed based on perspective based on knowledge and capability theories dynamics the model evaluates the value chain through prepositions bda used to leverage diferent forms of knowledge in order to create organizational agility bda to provide organizational agility to the company through the use of efective knowledge management companies that have this type of capacity dynamics can achieve competitive advantage directly ha or indirectly through busines proceses hb the results obtained through the use of busines proceses wil

the organization resource management through establishing proces archetype comercial for big data initiatives directing atention to creating capacity dynamics with such initiatives and identifying the drawbacks of rbt theory in the big data context the thre aproaches related to the theory based on resources the knowledge based vision of organizations and the capabilities dynamics the later sen as the ways in which organizations shape andchapter systematic literature review continualy reconfigure proceses to achieve beneficial results braganza et al dynamic capabilities sugest ways in which organizations that wish to exploit big data they reconfigure resources to make these initiatives events repeated ible and sustainable rather than isolated events reconfiguration and transformation efective require an ability to detect relevant changes constant monitoring of markets and technologies readines to adopt best practices and evaluation comparative the more frequently an organization reconfigures and transforms its capabilities the the greater the probability of achieving competitive advantages braganza et al for their part eisenhardt and martin sugest that in organizations dynamic capabilities are simple experimental and iterative in contrast to more stable markets where they are complex analytical and linear eisenhardt martin argote concludes that organizations face dificulties when leaders use existing knowledge to generalize from past experiences in this sense zolo winter on page propose the capabilities dynamics arise from the coevolution of proceses of acumulation of tacit experience with explicit activities of articulation and codification of knowledge the development of dynamic capabilities invoke mechanisms that go beyond the tacit acumulation of experience implicit knowledge is articulated through colective discusion sesions information and performance evaluation proceses braganza et al hil jones mentions that some dynamic capabilities include proceses of product development resource alocation and knowledge creation proceses these proceses alow the creation of colaboration networks betwen internal and external relationships that generate combinations of resources to met or exced customer expectations stakeholders hil jones organizations combine skils data technologies and experience to create products and services that generate income greater eficiency and generaly greater competitive advantages braganza et al in braganza et al it is shown that big data proceses must change dynamicaly in response to external and internal influences of organizations presenting in their study bases to map the ways in which organizations digital transformation and organizational performance in companies in the information sector electric power adapt and transform their capabilities based on the strategic knowledge they obtained from big data initiatives aditionaly braganza et al concludes that the relationship betwen big data and dynamic capabilities are important because big data proceses must transform over time as organizations reconfigure or develop new capabilities to achieve results from the knowledge acquired in big data dynamic capabilities can be considered to represent an apropriate aproach to study the efect of information systems and big data the bda can be used in diferent places uations and can provide competitive advantage over the market changing and high global competitivenes bda capabilities are set of capabilities that can help an organization adapt resource base existing to adres diferent information neds that suport decision making decision rialti et al bda progresively influences the competitivenes of organizations their performance organizational and financial from generating organizational capacity to identify and take advantage of new oportunities sek colaborations and strategic partners improve the knowledge flow and facilitate knowledge sharing mcafe brynjolfson merendino et al rialti et al however these positive efects of big data are derived from the organizational decision to implement them establish strategies change management and dynamic capabilities to leverage data in the organization managers have the ability to make decisions apropriate strategies acording with the available information on internal proceses and operations suply performance of profesionals and behavioral paterns of users rialti et al therefore bda is resource with multiple use potential to solve various isues to achieve these solutions routines proceses and capabilities are required to convert said data into meaningful information côrte real et al where the experience of analysts and managers can increase their analysis eficiency this analysis big data can generate enormous flows of knowledge that must be chaneled into data management proces rialti et al based on the knowledge generated with bigchapter systematic literature review data it is important to pay atention to the impact of data on decision making proceses decisions and organizational performance rialti et al in conclusion bda can generate knowledge and change the way managers they think and act based on an adequate information management system this requires ensure that managers receive the corect information when making decisions to improve performance respond to suden changes or identify new models busines emerging oportunity and consequently decide the best path to folow for the organization rialti et al resource based view rbv in gunasekaran et al the asimilation of big data and

the proces of extracting information and the use of consumer knowledge to improve dynamic and adaptive capabilities of the organization ereveles et al in braganza et al some limitations are identified in the theory based on resources in the context of big data initiatives given that the implementation was caried out thinking about the management of organizational resources and it is argued that big data nulifies digital transformation and organizational performance in companies in the information sector electric power many of the asumptions of resource based theory to achieve an advantage competitive such as for example open aces to data so that consent can be proven or questioned poper data that is often not posible to aces due to confidentiality isues data is considered one of the critical resources in big data and theory based on resources introduced in _wos provides framework caled vrin value rarity imperfect imitability and non substitutability including property of the resources and their atributes to consider strategic resources in order to provide deper understanding of the strategic actions of organizations barney sugests that strategic resources have four atributes value rarity imperfect imitability and non substitutability and identifies that they generate sources of competitive advantage thus coner sugests that the degre of heterogeneity of resources influences the potential for competitive advantage proposing that the atributes of value and rarity confers competitive advantage while inimitability and non substitutability along with the other two confer sustainability coner for other part citing hofer and schendel and grant the folowing clasification is sugested of types of resources grant hofer schendel financial resources physical resources human resources re organizational courses quality control systems corporate culture relations technological capabilities intangible resources reputation brand recognition godwil wilpower in the realm of big data physical capital resources include platforms for colecting and store large amounts volume of truthful data that continuously flows into real time velocity from many diferent sources variety and big data analytics human capital resources include information from data scientists and strategies to capture valid data manage and extract information capital resources include an organizational structure that alows the company to transform data into knowledge and being able to use it in decision making and concrete actions ereveles etchapter systematic review of the literature

valentin therefore to generate competitive advantage with resources it is required that leaders develop capabilities structure resources to use in proceses methodologies of acquiring and implementing big data analytics in the busines gunasekaran et al capabilities are necesity for the organization and depend on its context because these are subset of the resources that are not transferable and have as objective to improve the productivity of other resources ereveles et al gunasekaran et al acording to the above in digital organization leaders must ensure their strategic priorities cultural values organizational norms and ensure transmit them to your colaborators thus human aspects such as charisma motivation adaptation and the ability to be facilitators become the most important characteristics in leaders of digital organizations ciani mary and steven steckler these responsive leaders must facilitate the design execution of actions and be open to employe initiatives alowing criticism and fedback are tols that strengthen them dery sebastian van der meulen in conclusion sustainable leadership focused on the employe experience with systemic learning mechanisms and strategies linked to the vision of the organization simplify work life and instil inovative behaviors based on leadership shared dery et al on the other hand the organizational culture is based on the

atention to the factors that promote or hinder the digital transformation in organizations it is identified that the greatest amount of documents about the study topics were made starting in thus it is evident that the topic under study betwen digital transformation and performance organizational is curent however there are no authorships that remain with time which sugests varied productivity and is not to specific on the topic under study the oldest publications year are related to the impact on the organizations asociated with the use of information technologies and big data regarding the relationship betwen the variables of the equation maps link is evident direct betwen big data and organizational performance aditionaly it presents recurently the formation of clusters around big data changes organizational and performance strategy and busines inteligence systems and technology and information management chapter methodology the methodologies used to evaluate conceptual models are described below that relate the constructs and hypotheses proposed in the model to evaluate the efect on organizational performance due to the implementation and use of digital technologies methodologies in gunasekaran et al the resource based vision theory is used to conceptualize bdpa asimilation as capacity that impacts the suply chain suply and organizational performance with the help of conectivity resources and exchange of information under the mediation of senior management comitment the method used is through five point likert scale survey aproach from strongly disagre to strongly agre which were put tested by group of experienced researchers later nte taking into acount taking into acount the sugested adjustments the questionaire was sent via email to consultants and suply chain managers to review structure readability ambiguity and integrity to have modified final instrument based on coments as result the asimilation of bdpa is conceptualized as proces that involves aceptance routinization and asimilation considering the impact of resources conectivity and exchange of information and capabilities ability to asimilate big data in scp and op this suports the argument that if the resources are mediated by the comitment of senior management it is posible to achieve aceptance of bdpa first step to achieve asimilation with this study it is considered that the rbv theory is important to understand asimilation of bdpa as capability that depends on the poling of resources conectivity and exchange of information and with which positive impacts are obtained in the chain of suply organizational performance and thereby achieve competitive advantage busines chapter systematic literature review for its part the model proposed in côrte real et al and the validation of the hypotheses that evaluate the entire suply chain are tested through survey in several countries of european organizations the study uses survey instrument based on review of the literature and validation of the content scope and purpose of the made by academic researchers and language experts subsequently pilot study with executives from diferent companies to the aplication group of the main survey in order to make modifications to the final instrument eliminating ambiguities and simplifying interpretation experiments and validation within the proposed models validations are presented in côrte real et al empirical through surveys directed at european companies and their executives it busineses where it is evident that bda can provide comercial value in various stages of the companies value chain creating organizational agility through through knowledge management and its impact on proceses and benefits competitive demonstrating in turn that agility can partialy mediate the efect betwen knowledge asets and performance proces level and advantage competitive for its part in order to prove that data driven companies would have beter results in terms of busines

improvement cycle to develop measures that satisfy al requirementschapter systematic literature review of reliability validity and unidimensionality chen paulraj they used so much alpha composite reliability scr as the cronbach scale fornel larcker henseler ringle sinkovics the comonly used method fornel larcker was used to calculate the validity convergent and discriminant with criteria of shared average variance les than and values of the square rot of the average variance extracted ave for each construct realized greater than any corelation estimate aditionaly they were considered several fit indices for each construct from the analysis unidimensionality was obtained of the general fit of the model and discriminant validity chapter design and practice implementation experimental next the proposal for an experimental practice to evaluate the taking is presented of decisions by profesionals from companies in the electric energy sector in order to determine the influence of the information provided for decision making as suport for the organizational performance of companies the implementation of the experiment aims to establish the relationship betwen information and decision making to subsequently link digital transformation with organizational performance through of model of structured equations that alows the direct relationships to be demonstrated and indirect betwen the asociated variables the design of the experiment is proposed contemplating scenario with information and another without this is for decision making alowing you to evaluate the contribution of digital transformation in companies through information and data based evidence for making of decisions in the execution of energy projects the experiment is caried out using as foundation the theory of experimental economics which aplies methods to study the interaction of human beings in social contexts governed by rules explicit or implicit fatás juberías roig cotanda design and implementation the design of the experiment is based on the folowing hypothesis which we wish to validate does having more information actualy help us make beter decisions wanted provide solution to the hypothesis raised by fulfiling the folowing objectives when runing the experiment establish the relationship betwen intuition versus evidence obtained through real data from organizational proceses in decision making chapter design and implementation of experimental practice identify the importance of data around decision making taking into acount realize that technology provides enormous amounts of data in information that it may be function of decision making the design was developed acording to the flow diagram presented in the digital transformation and organizational performance in companies in the healthcare sector electric power figure flowchart of the design and aplication of the experiment for him the experiment tok into acount considerations in

profesionals with some decision making power in the organizations to which they belong the above given that it seks to establish the relationship betwen decision making and intuition versus decision making with evidence given by the information of the organization proceses in relation to the nature of the payments of the experiment box was delivered of chocolates valued at usd to each participant delivered at the end of the execution of the activity experiment design surveys were conducted aimed at organizations in the electricity sector in colombia for through the participation of its busines executives with tactical decision making power and strategic the surveys were designed on the gogle forms online platform and were aplied in the aforementioned events during the sesion context presentation of the experiment is made indicating the objective and establishing the basic rules for the aplication of the experiment it was used an execution time of minutes for each of the two days besides the survey specified instructions specifying the aplication procedure aditionaly each sesion was acompanied by suport profesionals for the resolution of concerns digital transformation and organizational performance in companies in the healthcare sector electric power in the instrument survey scenarios were presented so that acording to the given conditions the decision making of each profesional wil be caried out tending to analyze subsequently whether or not the participant used the information provided for each scenery the context coresponds to daily situation in the electrical sector that requires the taking of decision the first scenario considers the context given without information that is that the context is presented and the participant is sought to make the decision based on the interaction of your intuition your prior knowledge experience emotions and sensations product of working under presure for its part the second scenario includes relevant information about the organization and inputs that come from asumed data in order to obtain decision making based on the use of the information present before aplying the final survey validation pilot aplication is caried out with the in order to make modifications to the final instrument eliminating ambiguities and simplifying interpretation validating content scope and purpose the pilot is aplied to master students from the faculty of sciences of the national university of colombia which provided fedback on the design of the proposed instrument giving as result of the survey finaly aplied the experiment alows the participants to be divided into thre groups and in order to deliver diferent criteria and statements for decision making of the folowing way group the decision making context is provided and no criteria or statements aditional group the decision making context and suporting criteria are provided related to economic aspects of the solution group the decision making context and suporting criteria are provided related to social experimental economic regulatory and technological at the begining of the experiment each participant is asigned group for analysis purposes resulting information the survey is divided into sections the first includes information general related to personal educational and employment data the second with the content of the decision context and the suporting criteria statements for each group chapter design and implementation of experimental practice the last one compiles al the criteria and suporting statements for decision making and is asks al participants regardles of the group to which they have ben linked to select those that were taken into acount when making the decision execution or not of the project the detail of the aplied instrument and its sections is presented in anex analysis of results the pr procedures for executing the experiment which are standardized with the proposed environment included the definition of step by step explanation of the experiment data colection this was done online storage data and results were saved online aditional information generated automaticaly by the online gogle forms tol data treatment through tables and graphs that best represent way the results obtained debuging eroneous data and responses to decision making are excluded without justification payments were made once the sesion ended data verification considered the most important part of the proces for the refined data is then graphed so that the experimenter can visualy detect points that may indicate eroneous data if these data are distorted in some way the experimenter reviews the method used to the analysis of the cleaned data or cites the findings faithfuly below are the results obtained for each group of the experiment asigned group the group asignment was done so that there was an equal proportion for each group therefore it was achieved that the distribution was on average the distribution is presented in figure figure asignment of groups to participants digital transformation and organizational performance in companies in the healthcare sector electric power where group coresponds to the participants who did not have information or specific criteria for project decision making group for those who had some type of partial information and group to those who had the totality of information provided for decision making the project decision making for each group is presented in figure can show that al participants in group who did not have information opted for the execution of the project which alows us to conclude that the decision was made based on the previous conceptions of each participant now for groups and which had information the participants had an aproximate percentage of non aproval of the execution of the project in question this may be related to the specific information they tok into acount with criteria that do not justify the viability of the project and this shows the use of information provided for decision making figure decision making for each group of the experimentchapter design and implementation of experimental practice decision making criteria this section provided al the criteria provided to group plus some aditional ones in order for al the participants in the experiment to select the criteria or statements that were taken into acount when making the decision on the execution or not of the pr proposed project from the responses obtained it can be concluded that the criteria and statements that were taken into acount by the participants when making the decision making in greater proportion are economic aspect cost benefit analysis for the city of implementation with regulatory aspect law of with aspects asociated with technology autonomy of electric vehicles evs vs average end user journeys with the criteria that had participation betwen and are the folowing economic aspects of the technology decrease in batery cost regulatory aspect decre of tarif levy economic aspects time to return on investment economic aspects operating cost of an electric vehicle technological economic aspect optimal management system reduction investment cost technological aspect technology maturity finaly the criteria that had the least participation betwen and for decision making are impresion of technology technology not mature enough with others participants aded other criteria asociated with their choice these are the project presents positive financial indicators for the company aditionaly it can become flagship project for the promotion of electric mobility contributing to the masification of the technology contributing to the environment among others digital transformation and organizational performance in companies in the healthcare sector electric power corporate image and the company being in the electrical sector must give example to folow on how to aply this technology perception of competitors competing company did not achieve results expected environmental aspects insuficient final disposal of bateries regulatory aspects incipient regulation and regulations economic aspects investment cost it should be taken into acount that participants could select more than one criterion and or afirmation therefore the sum of the individual percentages does not corespond to figure presents the criteria that the participants tok into acount when making the decision about whether or not to execute the context project figure selected criteria for decision making it is posible to identify that the aspects that were least taken into acount at the time of the decision making were those related to the impresion of the technology maturity insuficient the perception of competitors competitor company did not reach the projected results environmental aspects refering to the final disposal of insuficient bateries emerging regulatory and policy isues and the cost of capital chapter design and implementation of experimental practice the investment this shows that the participants do not use the information to large extent of asumptions stories and perceptions without true and confirmed information on the other hand participants largely selected the criteria asociated with the technology with information on the autonomy of electric vehicles evs vs average routes of the organization the regulatory aspect of law of which promotes the use of both public and private evs and the aspect related to the cost benefit analysis this is posibly because with acurate and reliable information technological context suported by previous tests and results alows us to have guarante and generates confidence when making decisions in medium proportion the economic and technological aspects tok precedence over the moment of decision making the economic aspects focused on the decrease of the cost of the batery the payback time and the cost of operating electric vehicle and technological ones in the maturity of technology and systems optimal management have greater weight because it is information usualy found in media of general interest of public knowledge masive and easily acesible finaly it is evident that the criteria and statements provided had direct consequence in the decision to execute or not the silver project so it is infers that information has an implicit relationship in decision making given this panorama it is necesary to formulate hypotheses that alow establishing relationship existing betwen information and organizational performance having as reference the implicit relationship with decision making information suported by the initiatives of digital transformation acording to the review presented in the previous chapters and taking as reference decision making as suport for generation of competitive advantages within the organization that in turn provide an improvement in organizational performance chapter model structural equations in the previous chapters conceptual isues related to the themes of digital transformation and organizational performance establishing in the search equation maps from the systematic literature review the link direct betwen big data and digital transformation initiatives the proposed model is based on establishing the relationship betwen big data as relevant part of the transformation digital and the organizational performance of companies subsequently after reviewing the theories of dc rbv and kbv it is determined to propose heterogeneous structural equation model that includes the contribution of the thre methodologies taking as starting point experiments and validations analyzed in the reference articles aditionaly it is decided to cary out an experimental practice in order to check if the information is used for decision making to suport performance organizational based on the evidence that the information provided has an impact on the decision making link with organizational performance can be asumed in acordance with the above this chapter proposes an equation model structural that relates betwen digital transformation with central axis of big data and organizational performance constructs related to transformation are presented digital and organizational performance used in the formulation of the equation model proposed structural this model presents the relationship that exists betwen resources transformation elements digital focused on big data and organizational performance where the participation of decision making in the generation of competitive advantages such as mediator of the implementation of bda chapter design and implementation of experimental practice finaly an instrument is aplied in order to validate the proposed model and establish the preponderant relationships of the model constructs of the organization that take advantage of digital transformation constructs for the construction of the structural equations model the constructs asociated with digital transformation and with elements of the organization with in order to develop constructs hypotheses that relate to each of the elements of the structural equation model each construct is considered as an element of the proposed model and subsequently the relationships present betwen each element are analyzed through constructs to then cary out the coresponding asesment using an instrument completed by experts from the electrical sector in order to validate the model the constructs that relate to each other to give rise to the proposed constructs for the development of the model they are clasified as folows constructs asociated with digital transformation to big data bd big data can be created from large colection of sensors databases emails websites

to figure analysis of the validation information of the conceptual model of the relationship betwen digital transformation and organizational performancechapter design and implementation of experimental practice figure validated conceptual model of the relationship betwen digital transformation and organizational performance in this validated model the relationships given by constructs and were eliminated bd alows the creation of information exchange is conectivity is positively related to bda aceptance without the construct it becomes evident that the information to be exchanged is not required must be exclusively of large volumes of information giving rise to the existence the exchange of information of any amount of data whether or not they are part of initiatives of big data by eliminating the relationship given by conectivity is presented as mediator betwen technology and infrastructure and the exchange of information giving meaning to the flow of information to bda through the link that alows conectivity therefore the final proposed conceptual model obtained in the present study after the validation is presented in figure digital transformation and organizational performance in companies in the healthcare sector electric power figure proposed final conceptual model obtained after validation in the final model formulated it is evident that the digital transformation strategy influences directly in the asociated constructs to the management of resources both physical technologies and infrastructure as wel as those asociated with human resources establishing its direct relationship with these through the construct furthermore the strategy of organization is responsible for ensuring strategic it flexibility enabling bda busines partnership and alignment through senior management comitment and its management responsibility this partnership and alignment of busineses asociated with bda makes posible the direct relationship with bda through construct technology and infrastructure resources include it deployment capabilities infrastructure flexibility integration and standardization capabilities proceses integration of computer systems the efective use of data agregation data analysis tols and their interpretation this alows us to display the relationships with bd construct and with conectivity construct for its part human resources group together the analysis capabilities of personel asociated with td initiatives the organizational relationship staf skils analytics culture and the organizational relationship for the development of functions asigned elements that alow developing the analytics present in bda construct and generate the dynamic capacity of organizational agility construct chapter design and implementation of experimental practice after the elimination of constructs and relationship was generated betwen technology and infrastructure and bda through the mediation of conectivity and exchange of information where data are considered asets of organizations that at the same time generating the apropriate flow of information can provide competitive advantages to the take this information into acount when making decisions acording to the validation caried out figure shows strong aceptance of the direct relationship betwen bd and bda construct with median of taking as the foundation of the preceding relationship of the construct betwen technology and infrastructure and big data from bda the relationship with bda capabilities is validated with measure of that is suported by the construct which establishes that the difusion of bda positively influences the creation of bda capabilities these capabilities corespond to the transformation and analysis of data and is based on the adaptation of existing resources suport decision making and management talent and technology consequently from of bda capabilities the implementation of bda is proposed in construct with the management of the generated capacities the management of bda resources and guaranteing the quality of data analytics as consequence of the capabilities of bda and its implementation the relationships with knowledge management through the constructs and respectively where this management coresponds to the creation storage transfer and aplication of knowledge with eficient management functionalities data and proper delivery to end users knowledge sharing knowledge management establishes positive influence on dynamic capacity organizational agility which alows detecting and responding to changes in the environment simplifying ways of working and acelerating proceses this agility positively impacts performance at the proces level providing improvements in suply chain performance scp in production and operations increasing labor productivity and the ofer of products and services for its part decision making mediated by the implementation of bda construct generates sustainable competitive advantages in organizations this alows infer that using information from big data initiatives has an influence on decision making of decisions and agres with the conclusion of the experimental economics experiment digital transformation and organizational performance in companies in the information sector electric power where criteria and statements as information provision influenced decision making final decision now decision making is considered as link and suport for the generation of sustainable competitive advantages an element that becomes focus important part of the model as it is mediated by the direct influence of the management of the knowledge organizational agility performance at the proces level and decision making itself therefore competitive advantages group together the related to the improvement of financial performance with indicators such as reducing suply chain costs and generating eficient operations and economic policies that generate value for the organization furthermore they are asociated with strategic performance with the strengthening of relationships with supliers the planing improvement and the strategic advantages generated on the competitors the influence of performance at the proces financial and strategic levels contribute positively to organizational performance which provides value in busines strategy involves planers managers directors advisors businesmen among others likewise it alows gathering indicators for measuring performance against competitors such as quotas or participation of average market average sales volume and average sales growth organizational performance is transversaly impacted by the elements technological and infrastructure asociated with digital transformation human resources and their skils data analytics capabilities and their impact on the proceses at hand proces level and finaly about the organization strategy which integrates builds reorganizes and reconfigures internal and external competencies to adapt to the environments of change as posed by the dynamic capabilities presented previously in conclusion we can highlight the proposed model that shows the articulation of the resource based theories managed by td strategy vision based knowledge through the integration of knowledge management with bda capabilities and their implementation in adition the bost in dynamic capacity of organizational agility through knowledge management by providing bd tols and their direct influence with human resources to generate the chapter design and implementation of experimental practice competitive advantages that drive improved organizational performance contextualized and determined by the dimensions of organization personel and technological conclusions below are the conclusions of this research which they highlight the fulfilment of the stated objectives and purposes conclusions in the development of the conceptual framework close relationship betwen the life cycle asociated with digital transformation and the big conversion proces data in information and knowledge therefore the theory of big data was considered as one of the foundations of digital transformation the maps from the rsl search equation repeatedly present the formation of clusters around big data organizational changes and performance strategy and busines inteligence systems and management technologies and information furthermore direct link was evident betwen big data and organizational performance the proces of the experimental economics experiment and the validation of the model proposed alows us to identify that the proceses of the organizations work as phenomena that have objective and diverse realities which can be expresed in causal relationships and measured through data in many ocasions in real time and that produce knowledge as key element in the generation of value in organizations in the decision making experiment it is shown that truthful and reliable information technological context suported by previous tests and results alows us to have guarante and generates confidence when making decisions this is suported by the fact that participants largely selected the criteria asociated with the technology with information on ev autonomy vs average trips of the organization the regulatory aspect regarding law of which promotes the use of both public and private evs and the aspect related to cost benefit analysis the proposed structural equations model establishes relationship betwen digital transformation focused on big data and organization performance nizacional from of rsl in dc theory and the contribution of some methodologies experiments and analyzed validations of rbv and kbv theories in the proposed structural equations model that establishes the relationship betwen digital transformation and organizational performance shows that the strategy of digital transformation must group together the constructs asociated with the management of physical resources technologies and infrastructure and human resources besides the the organization strategy must be in charge of guaranteing flexibility strategic it enable bda busines partnership and alignment through of the management comitment and in this way makes posible the direct relationship with bda technology and infrastructure resources include in the capabilities of it deployment infrastructure flexibility capabilities integration and standardization of proceses integration of computer systems the efective use of data agregation tols data analysis tols and its interpretation alowing relationships to be established with bd and with the conectivity human resources group the analysis capabilities of asociated personel to td initiatives the organizational relationship the skils of the staf the analytics culture and the organizational relationship for the development of functions asigned which alow developing the analytics present in bda and generating agility organizational as dynamic capability positive influence of knowledge management is established with the ability organizational agility dynamics this alows you to detect and respond to changes of the environment simplifying ways of working and acelerating proceses besides this agility positively impacts performance at the proces level providing improvements in suply chain performance in the production and operations increasing labor productivity and the suply of products and services digital transformation and organizational performance in companies in the sector electrical energy decision making mediated by the implementation of bda generates advantages sustainable competitivenes in organizations therefore it is infered that using the information from big data initiatives has an influence on decision making decisions and agres with the results of the economics experiment experimental where criteria and statements as information provision influenced the final decision making the generation of sustainable competitive advantages becomes focus importance of the proposed model and is mediated by the influence of the management of the knowledge organizational agility proces level performance and decision making of decisions the influence of performance at the proces financial and strategic levels contribute positively to organizational performance which provides value in the strategy of the companies involving planers managers directors advisors businesmen among others organizational performance is influenced transversaly by the elements technological and infrastructure asociated with digital transformation the resources humans and their skils data analytics capabilities and their impact about the proceses at the proces level and finaly by the strategy of the organization the proposed model articulates the theory based on resources managed by the td strategy the vision based on knowledge through the integration of knowledge management with bda capabilities and its implementation and union with the dynamic capacity of organizational agility through management of knowledge by providing tols for db initiatives the proposed model alows representing the relationships betwen the concepts independent and dependent organizations that interact in efect of digital transformation on organizational performance and it is posible to evaluate the contribution and reliability of each established construct and hypothesis besides this model shows the importance of digitalization in organizations to generate value in busines and in decision making as long as the companies define changes in proceses functions organizational culture and profesional capabilities of the organization to be able to adapt to the schemes decision making operation based on real time information and finaly improve your performance recomendations the present study provides the bases that demonstrate the existing relationships betwen digital transformation and organizational performance with input so that researchers can examine the causal relationships betwen the findings of the constructs of digital transformation and the changes required in organizations at the level of performance therefore based on the research caried out it is recomended to undertake research similar or continue with research on the folowing topics

organizations from diferent sectors have caried out series of initiatives to explore new digital technologies and harnes their benefits mat et al amorim melao with the aim of facing competition in the midst of globalized world amorim melao these initiatives have involved transformations mainly in the comercial area afecting products and proceses as wel as organizational and management structures this is known as transformation digital mat et al this has become an important part of human life and necesary in almost al companies seking growth expansion quality and sustainability amorim melao

higher education institutions ies rodrigues educase the later have the chalenge of transforming themselves to adres social changes cultural and technological that are being presented furthermore they face the ned to provide adequate responses to the expectations of students teachers researchers administrative staf and society in general tic fits mention that education is considered main factor of development factors that influence digital transformation in education institutions higher education national university of colombia bogotá headquarters socioeconomic therefore the ned arises to implement digital transformation in the education sector akhmetshin et al this is in view of the fact that digital technologies alow transforming the educational proces and transfer it to qualitatively new and user friendly level safiulin akhmetshin for this reason and to guarante the competitivenes of educational institutions higher education ies the digitalization of its services wil be necesary as part of its proces of digital transformation safiulin akhmetshin however the introduction of digital technologies in their activities wil not be enough they wil also be necesary cultural and organizational changes safiulin akhmetshin in that in this sense the digital transformation in university wil imply changes in al its proceses taking into acount its characteristics and specificity safiulin akhmetshin on the other hand research on digital transformation has ben oriented especialy to analyze the efects in the context of busines organizations and busines proceses wilms et al jackson while the research on the higher education sector has ben incipient in the practice it has ben identified that some universities in the world have developed digital initiatives and strategies to adres this transformation proces no however these have lacked vision capacity or comitment for efective implementation within their institutions mcusker babington by this requires research on how heis should understand give hapines digital transformation and the requirements asociated with it mar et al this is the starting point that suports this research which wil be developed in the folowing way from the review of the literature the factors that influence digital transformation and are subsequently contrasted with the opinion of experts in digital transformation proceses in ies for this it is taken as case study the national university of colombia headquarters bogotá these factors wil serve as basis for those responsible for digital transformation proces in

research factors that influence digital transformation in information institutions higher education national university of colombia bogotá headquarters general context of the research in this first chapter the context of the transformation is presented in general way digital in higher education institutions the aproach to the problem with respective research question objectives justification and methodology proposal for research context in recent years digital transformation has become one of the main trends both in industry and in the public sector kaminskyi et al this it is considered an organic and structural transformation that makes use of resources of the organization especialy human resources in adition to this it suports in technology in order to improve organizational performance rodrigues ventures however these are not the only elements they are also relevant organizational culture and strategic planing heavin power likewise digital transformation makes organizations search in way permanently secure its competitive position in order to achieve this the organization suports technology which is the main cause of change and tol fundamental to achieve this purpose shoham pery this becomes relevant to higher education institutions through gives that increases the competition mainly to select the best students and researchers faria nóvoa however most of those responsible for this transformation lack clarity about the diferent options and elements that must be considered as consequence run the risk of not taking into acount important elements or ignoring solutions that they are more favorable for specific situation of the organization hes et al furthermore managers have dificulties in starting the proces of digital transformation related to the prioritization of activities within the organization berghaus back this transformation chalenges managers to rethink their busines models promote digital inovation adapt their strategy structure and organizational culture to the requirements that this demands it the same thing hapens in higher education institutions they have started this transformation proces but stil ned to determine the requirements asociated with it mar et al transforming company into digital company is dificult however many companies have ben sucesful and there are few that have not completed this transformation there is no single formula nor is there guide bok or checklist that managers can folow for the implementation of this proces economic forum world cup even so this transformation has begun and is having profound impact on al sectors and the educational sector is no exception educase problem statement the digital transformation in higher education institutions ies has begun but there is stil lack of research on how to understand this proces the requirements necesary to start and those in charge of the proces do not have the clarity regarding the elements to consider taking into acount the above the present investigation its objective is to contribute with the identification of the factors that influence this transformation in colombian heis as the first step within this great proces factors that influence digital transformation in higher education institutions higher education national university of colombia bogotá headquarters for the development of this research the national university of colombia bogotá headquarters given its position in the educational sector seniority and presence at the national level aditionaly because it is university that has begun its digital transformation proces as outlined in its global plan development research question what are the factors that influence digital transformation in education institutions higher education objectives general objective identify the factors that influence the digital transformation in the institutions of higher education specific objectives identify in the literature the facts ores related to digital transformation characterize each of the identified factors that influence the digital transformation in higher education institutions contrast with experts the factors previously characterized in the national university of colombia bogotá headquarters methodology methodology is structured set of guidelines or activities to help people to cary out research or interventions generaly methodology is develops implicitly or explicitly within particular paradigm and embodies the asumptions and philosophical principles of the paradigm mingers brocklesby for this research the multimethodology of mingers was proposed which is refers to the use of plurality of methods or techniques qualitative and quantitative in real world intervention the above because this methodology it is complex and multidimensional which alows closer view of reality while the use of single method would be limited vision by combining methodologies or parts of it alows us to build an efective combination to try to comprehensively particular intervention mingers brocklesby this is suported by the paradigm of critical realism which suports the idea of combining diferent research methods what is caled mixed methods research or multimethodology mingers et al critical realism directs atention toward the real problems and their underlying causes mingers et al acording to bhaskar the critical realism goes against the empiricist vision of science embodied in the positivism and the idealist social vision of science embodied in constructivism or interpretivism mingers et al due to the above and to answer the research question the multimethodology of mingers brocklesby based on four phases apreciation asesment of the problem situation expresed by any actor of the situation literature and previous theories mingers analysis wil involve methods of analysis of the methodologies and data obtained in the apreciation stage mingers factors that influence digital transformation in information institutions higher education national university of colombia bogotá headquarters evaluation evaluation of the postulated explanations and propositions afirmed within the research taking into acount the objective of visualizing diferentialy the problem situation mingers action for this investigation it coresponds to the presentation and socialization of the results obtained during the research case study component that is part of multimethodology is the case study this is used as research tol aplied to organizational studies and of administration among others that contributes to the knowledge iment of phenomena individual organizational social and political yin case study can be particular organization project or procedure and there may be multiple cases within research project mingers furthermore the study of case often includes methods such as interviews and questionaires mingers of in this way it alows the researcher to obtain holistic view and capture the significant features of real life events proceses organizational and management international relations and industry evolution yin taking into acount the above the national university was taken as case study of colombia bogotá headquarters given that among the public heis it is the oldest and representative of the country due to its coverage and presence at the national level locations besides it is curently

digital transformation also describes the trigering tactical trading movements or strategic through data driven insights and the launch of digital busines models that enable new ways to capture worth kane align strategy workforce culture technology and organization structure to met digital expectations of customers employes and partners hes et al it has to do with the changes that digital technologies can cause in the busines model of company resulting in modified products or organizational structures or in the proces automation these changes can be observed in the increasing demand for internet based media which has led to changes of entire busines models in the industry of the music horlacher et al use of new digital technologies such as social networks devices mobile analytics

segments of it over time hes et al kane the suces of these initiatives depends on how senior management cordinates them as they are executed at the same time oswald kleinemeier as wel as the management of the investment that these demand muge et al likewise digital transformation can be oriented towards diferent results for example in the case of manufacturing company the digital transformation proces can mean the automation of proceses to deliver beter quality products to the customer at faster pace while for the service industry this can mean digitizing and improving comunication and customer touchpoints gebayew et al digital transformation digitization and digitization through the literature review the terms digital transformation apeared digitization and digitization which are used synonymously yes although it is not apropriate since each term is diferent legner et al bockshecker et al cerstin mahlow hediger digitization refers to the integration of it with existing tasks verhoef et al for example reading online texts as pdfs not as paper textboks cerstin mahlow hediger digitalization for its part is transformation proces induced by technology which improves the flexibility agility and responsivenes of organization by simultaneously aligning its operations strategies proceses busines organizational and it structures imgrund et al this refers for for example the creation of new comunication chanels with online customers or mobile through the use of digital forms in order proceses the use of digital surveys or the use of digital aplications which implies transforming the internal and external documentation proceses but does not change the activities of value creation verhoef et al another example worth highlighting is the realization of anotations in pdf document and that these anotations can be viewed with other people cerstin mahlow hediger bockshecker et al sugests that digitization and digitization triger digital phenomena that alow organizations to operationalize the proces of digital transformation for agarwal et al digital transformation is phenomenon that encompases the entire organization and that seks inovation of the core busines model through the use of digital technology for example in the health sector there is widespread use of it enabling fundamental change in the provision of health services and interaction with supliers customers and competitors another example in the sector automotive is volvo cars this one is hiring digital executives and dedicates part important part of your investment in or digital initiatives to cary out projects digital such as automated driving verhoef et al chalenges of digital transformation regarding the chalenges that digital transformation proces entails oliver kohnke presents study caried out by consulting firms where mention the most important chalenges that organizations face when they start this proces se table factors that influence the digital transformation in the institutions of higher education national university of colombia bogotá headquarters table main chalenges of digital transformation studio studio mit sloan management review and consulting mckinsey company bughin capgemini fitzgerald et al capgemini consulting bughin et al there is no urgency to start proces for lack of internal leadership or talent for digital transformation digital projects no budget available lack of data and purchase ension of how digital trends afect the competitivenes limitations of it systems inability to adopt mindset of experimentation roles and responsibilities are not lack of specific funding for clear digital initiatives lack of vision misaligned or competing interests betwen digital projects and busineses traditional unclear busines lack of participation or desire change curent practices by of senior management culture not susceptible to change the organizational structure is not apropriately designed for digital aspect lack of leadership skils inflexible busines proceses for take advantage of new oportunities source oliver kohnke fre translation by the author percentage of respondents study executives and managers study executives he italicized text indicates chalenges related to people and the organization oliver kohnke acording to table in the first study half of the chalenges are related to people and the available budget folowed by the lack of leadership and the lack of digital talent both functional and technical other chalenges are the lack of senior management involvement or desire to change curent practices asociated with an organizational structure designed inapropriately for the proces of transformation in the second study the lack of leadership and skils stands out in digital projects together with the lack of mentality open to experimentation and low participation of top management to change curent practices both studies demonstrate the importance of people and organizational aspects for digital transformation proces oliver kohnke faced with this the profesor rafi amit of wharton mentions that it is not technology that is the obstacle to digital transformation it is the people cited in bonet in colombia with the digital transformation survey caried out by the national asociation of entrepreneurs of colombia andi in the folowing bariers were identified and chalenges that companies face to achieve sucesful digital transformation se figure lack of human capital lack of leadership lack of clear busines model lack of mentality budget lack of knowledge lack of culture figure bariers and chalenges that companies face to achieve digital transformation sucesful own elaboration with data from the andi digital transformation survey it can be concluded that the chalenges and bariers evidenced in oliver article kohnke and the andi survey have aspects in comon such as the lack of culture and leadership the lack of mentality open to change the lack of budget and the lack of clear busines model factors that influence the digital transformation in the institutions of higher education national university of colombia bogotá headquarters impacts of digital transformation the impacts of digital transformation focus on the customer and the organization morakanyane et al the impact on the organization ocurs in thre areas customer experience operational proceses and busines models westerman et al through the customer experience on the one hand the inovation of the services within the organization and on the other hand customer retention and loyalty with this westerman et al regarding operational proceses these can generate efects in improving the eficiency of the organization save costs for both the organization as wel as the customer resulting in the creation of value morakanyane et al regarding busines models the reinvention of this is proces of digital transformation that sometimes involves radicaly changing products or services it ofers and the means it uses for sales this reinvention can lead change the nature of competition in your industry or reconfigure your suply chain value to ofer an eficiency advantage over its competitors westerman et al digital transformation in colombia for the digital transformation proces in colombia the national policy council economic and social conpes defined the document conpes caled national policy for digital transformation and artificial inteligence which aims to aim enhance the generation of social and economic value in the country through the strategic use of digital technologies in the public sector and the private sector to bost productivity and promote the wel being of citizens as wel as generate transversal enablers for the sectoral digital transformation so that colombia can take advantage of the oportunities and face the chalenges related to the fourth industrial revolution ir sic the topic of digital transformation is transversal to al sectors of the country mintic including the educational sector digital transformation in educational institutions higher education educase highlights that traditional higher education is reluctant to change and to risks being slow to act aditionaly idc mentions that the most higher education institutions sem oblivious to the changes in the society and prefer to continue working with teaching and learning proceses of last century making marginal use of information technologies without however it must be considered that if heis want to persist over time and not disapear it is necesary that they evolve integraly and begin proces of digital transformation mar et al on the other hand some heis have sen digital transformation as an oportunity to recontextualize learning cerstin mahlow hediger thus the heis have started to introduce technologies that alow creating learning contexts caled anytime and anywhere tay low authors as safiulin akhmetshin cal it open university which is the implementation of afordable distance education programs for people of everyone regardles of location through the use of platforms web colaborative cloud environments masive online courses fliped clasrom colective inteligence etc mareca bordel distance education programs under mocs masive open online courses sem to be one of the main drivers of change faced by higher education institutions mar amescua now at an organizational level in universities the existence of internal fragmentation of proceses and diversity of data given that these the later are dispersed in various information repositories including found duplicates being dificult to compare due to diferences in the format metadata conventions and terminology used safiulin akhmetshin this situation generates an oportunity within the digital transformation proces factors that influence digital transformation in information institutions higher education national university of colombia bogotá headquarters an example of digital transformation in an hei is the case presented by faria nóvoa from the university of porto in portugal which consisted of the creation of new shared services center with the aim of improving the quality of services delivered to the comunity which reduces overal costs and generates easy aces to its users this center colected al the services that were provided in each of schols and centralized them which required renginering proces of the entire university new work management system and an organizational culture that responded to these changes digital evolution at the national

proces provide point starting point to create sucesful transformations in organizations heavin power oliver kohnke these factors must be identified for their implementation in organizations from diferent sectors pihir et al by conducting literature review of the factors that influence the transformation digital it was found that authors such as morakanyane et al highlight that the digital technologies culture strategy and capital to the human with knowledge digital ones are what enable the digital transformation proces bonet nandan and george westerman et al highlight that organizational change is one of the critical factors for any digital transformation proces furthermore they define this change as the aplication of specific interventions to suport the transition of

organizational expertise digital flexibility organizational colaboration orientation towards the client own elaboration based on fischer et al imgrund et al pihir et al and rodrigues below is description of the factors identified in the review of literature digital strategy the digital strategy is multifunctional strategy which adreses al functions proceses and procedures of the organization fehér et al bienhaus hadud strategy is the strongest diferentiating aspect of organizations that they have digital maturity this is not limited to technological problems such as the use of mobile devices or migration to the cloud but shows how the organization can and should do busines diferently in the market kane for this reason the digital strategy must include objectives an action plan and comunication imgrund et al asignment of clear and apropriate responsibilities for their implementation mat et al likewise it must be led from senior management westerman bonet hes et al horlacher et al dremel et al pihir et al under the responsibility of director who must align with al strategies that can afect the entire organization mat et al including them it strategy and

proceses and procedures of the organization fehér et al bienhaus hadud in the proceses it is necesary to define methods that involve the workers in al the changes that the digital transformation entails since can generate resistance to these changes westerman bonet financial aspects asociated with the ability to finance the efort of the digital transformation hes et al provision of funds is required suficient since unforesen developments can afect the initiatives of said transformation imgrund et al in the case of heis technologies emerging markets tend to be expensive which combined with financial constraints that they face can make said transformation dificult therefore it is necesary ensure that the necesary resources are available for its implementation rodrigues factors that influence digital transformation in information institutions higher education national university of colombia bogotá headquarters interest groups stakeholders students graduates faculty administration industries society among others rodrigues regarding the projection of digital strategy it is highlighted that it is years kane organizational culture organizational culture in the digital transformation proces is perceived as valuable strategic aset which has the potential to suport such transformation and the implementation of digital technologies westerman et al downes et al this transformation generates the development of new products and proceses that require of an organizational culture with an open digital inovative mentality and with change orientation kane et al westerman et al fitzgerald et al organizational culture is formed from shared values and beliefs of employes members of an organization about what is considered desirable deal barney also defines it as complex set of values beliefs asumptions and symbols that define the way company conducts its busines in turn hartl hes highlight the folowing organizational values for the suces of digital transformation table table organizational values for the suces of digital transformation value description the organization openes to new ideas and its wilingnes to acept opening towards implement and promote change change the orientation of al the activities of the organization to satisfy the customer neds products and proceses are designed with focus customer focused based on customer neds and continualy adapted to their changes the organization pursuit of improvement and growth through the development of inovation inovations the organization wilingnes to work act restructure be flexible

for open non hierarchical discusion and the participation democratization of decision making proceses the organization positive atitude toward teamwork colaboration cros functional coperation and readines for coperation with external partners customers own elaboration based on hartl hes regarding the value of tolerance for failure those responsible for digital transformation they must foster an organizational culture based on evidence for decision making decisions learning from failure and motivation to introduce employes to inovate through cros functional teams dremel et al authors like fischer et al and dasgupta gupta regarding the value of risk afinity propose that organizations must have an open minded culture that facilitates creativity and risk taking on the other hand kane et al regarding the value of the agility mention that an organization suported by this value could facilitate the restructuring or the adoption of new management concepts regarding the value factors that influence the digital transformation in the institutions of higher education national university of colombia bogotá headquarters wilingnes to learn jöhnk et al highlight that organizations can encourage learning through smal incremental and iterative changes another important aspect that must be taken into acount within the proces of digital transformation is the promotion of data driven culture heavin power fischer et al muge et al the data must be perceived as valuable resource that can help an organization become digital and thus achieve competitive advantage for this reason it is necesary to establish culture of data exchange that alows for example busines functions take advantage of this data for decision making dremel et al leadership another important aspect within digital transformation proces is leadership this is subfactor asociated with the organizational culture factor where the managers and leaders are responsible for providing guidance throughout everything the proces comunicate the vision to the entire organization and try to reduce resistance from employes which frequently ocurs in organizations muge et al these leaders directly impact employe performance and failure or the suces of digital transformation kane et al maedche and bienhaus hadud mention that these managers must be inspiring people who drive the digital transformation proces throughout the company organization likewise new forms of leadership skils and organizational capabilities which have the potential to evolve the culture of an organization towards culture more open to inovation driven by technology kane et al within organizational capabilities the efort and teamwork is esential it is about articulating functional areas working very closely with the area and with the diferent lines of busines maedche resistance to change another subfactor that is part of the organizational culture factor is resistance to change authors such as hartl hes and rodrigues point out that culture organizational can be the main source of inertia that prevents the change in one organization disagrements and conflicts in organizations are sen as expresions of resistance to change but if handled properly the disagrements can also fuel inovation and learning hansen et al however resistance to change is defined as the main operational risk of company organization organizations have learned that erors in adaptation and digital economy can be lethal for example blockbuster once controled the largest part of the movie rental busines but was unable to adapt its busines model to new digital platforms such as netflix thus blockbuster declared bankruptcy in muge et al digital expertise another factor identified within digital transformation proces is expertise digital related to the capabilities skils and training of personel on topics digital aligned with the digital strategy fischer et al for this it is required of clearly defined roles and responsibilities within this proces that suport top management dremel et al curently digital transformation moves in highly dynamic markets presing employes to continualy adapt to new situations increasing their ned for agility and thus demanding greater ned for lifelong learning brosi et al at the organizational level managers must carefuly evaluate existing technological capabilities hes et al morakanyane et al and identify in the staf the new competencies and factors that influence the digital transformation in the institutions of higher education national university of colombia bogotá headquarters required skils colbert et al morakanyane et al fehér et al pucihar et al educase to develop these skils and competencies the organization must provide training for employes colbert et al bienhaus hadud muge et al another option is the subcontracting of personel for the implementation of the digital transformation proces which can have advantages in terms of fewer initial investments and spreading risks more widely however the disadvantage of this option is that it increases the risk of both losing competition required as of becoming dependent on third party therefore it must be maintained training proceses for internal employes to obtain competitive advantage hes et al an option proposed by dremel et al compared to the begining of digital transformation proces is to have an external consultancy at the same time develop technical skils and internal competencies in the organization now faced with the responsibility of senior management it begins with the definition of digital strategy which is often delegated to manager higher entity that could be the manager of the digital area or of busines unit afected by said proces of transformation hes et al this person wil be fuly responsible and would ad authority to strategy authors such as heavin power raise the ned to hire digital director chief digital oficer cdo who is focused on change organizational and customer other authors such as mat et al mention that even there is no clear answer as to which top manager should be in charge of the digital transformation posible candidates can be cio chief information oficer chief information oficer the ceo or the relatively new role of the chief digital oficer cdo however some organizations have created the position cdo chief digital oficer digital director who has key responsibility for defining the strategy and digital transformation activities as wel as managing new technologies digital and drive change in the organization becoming focal leader singh et al pereira et al among the competencies that cdo must poses are they find it competencies and resilience it competencies to formulate the it requirements and cordination of digital products and the resilience to cope to the problems that arise in the face of digital transformation pereira et al apart from the roles mentioned above new roles apear such as the bos data oficer data scientist or data analyst in the field of marketing new functions apear such as the person in charge of the marketing study oriented to web and social networks comunity manager henriete et al organizational flexibility the organizational flexibility factor apears as relevant factor within the digital transformation given that it requires flexible organizational structures and line with rapidly and continualy changing market conditions dremel et al fischer et al therefore agile organizations are required oliver kohnke fetig et al imgrund et al scalable and adaptable to respond to changes in the environment imgrund et al vial defines organizational agility as the ability of an organization to detect inovation oportunities and take advantage of them quickly in the market gathering the necesary asets knowledge and relationships pihir et al complement by highlighting that these resources must be implemented or redirected eficient and efective way to create value for the organization therefore structure flexible organizational structure includes flat hierarchies independent work and fredom of decision for employes major chalenge for most organizations today is that have traditional hierarchy based decision making proceses uias multiple levels of management and area based thinking which often leads to proceses that are to slow to deal with the interfunctional technological and factors that influence digital transformation in information institutions higher education national university of colombia bogotá headquarters rapid digital transformation oliver kohnke verhoef et al are rigid hierarchical corporate structures are losing importance in proces of digital transformation fetig et al colaboration regarding colaboration within digital transformation proces oswald kleinemeier and fischer et al propose that organizations must prepare your organizational proceses ensure adequate comunication by using technology to conect and colaborate with your stakeholders internal and external since digital transformation seks to improve the customer experience client amorim melao the it area must have very close colaboration with the comercial area to satisfy real neds of its clients dremel et al in the case of higher education institutions kaminskyi et al highlight that corporate it architecture is the basis for digital transformation showing that digital technologies improve the provision of educational services and the student experience customer orientation the digital transformation must be focused on the customer monitoring their experiences and predicting their neds pihir et al schwaferts baldi to the understanding their behavior and its impact on the organization rodrigues in this sense digital transformation opens up posibilities of targeting new customers and new customer segments schwaferts baldi acording to westerman et al customer experience must be the center of the digital transformation designed from the outside in customer participation must be given through new digital chanels and data and analytics are the vital elements of the reinvention of this experience in the case of heis they have diferent clients students graduates teachers administration parents industries society among others who have diferent behaviors towards technology that is where the digital strategy must contemplate how these wil adapt and make eficient use of them rodrigues in the case of students they demand an improvement in their experience with university for example in terms of administrative proceses the aces available hours day to al information and services through digital platforms rodrigues another important aspect is the information chanels schwaferts baldi highlight that using an inapropriate or obsolete chanel with the client can mean the los of busines oportunity and represent threat to the digital transformation factors that influence the digital transformation in the institutions of higher education national university of colombia bogotá headquarters evaluation of factors characterized by experts aplication of the delphi method once the factors have ben identified and characterized based on the literature review we proced with the evaluation of these through the experts who are part of the case study national university of colombia bogotá campus for this we used the delphi method acording to zapata ebrero this method is prospective that is based on the superiority of forecasting and diagnosis of group with respect to the results that are obtained from an individual the quality of the subjective group opinion is superior to the individual this method involves the selection of experts varela ruiz et al who are sends series of questionaires zapata ebrero in anonymous comunication with fedback zartha sosa et al and in diferent rounds they are asked for their opinion zapata ebrero for this investigation two rounds were aplied considered apropriate by zapata ebrero to obtain information from experts and achieve consensus and stability in their responses the number of rounds to be caried out it is comon to cary out cary out thre rounds and set them in advance of the study however the limitations temporal budgetary and the dificulty of maintaining the comitment of experts they mean that in few cases third round is caried out zapata ebrero the delphi method has thre characteristics the anonymity of the participants fedback or controled fedback and group statistical response zapata ebrero regarding the anonymity of the participants or experts it must be ensured that no participant can know the answers given by the other participants so as their identity zapata ebrero regarding fedback this consists of the transmision of information to the experts before each round in order to know the results obtained in the previous round or stage zapata ebrero the statistical group response arises from the answers given by the experts to the questionaires whose information is treated statisticaly to know the degre of agrement that has ben obtained on the topic analyzed zapata ebrero experts may reflect and reconsider their position due to new aproaches landaeta in this way the delphi method ends when there is consensus in the opinions and these stabilize during the rounds or stages caried out zapata ebrero selection of experts an expert is that individual whose situation and personal resources enable him contribute positively to the achievement of the goal that motivated the initiation of the work delphi landaeta cited in zapata ebrero an expert asumes the responsibility to isue judgments and opinions varela ruiz et al as for the the number of experts must be minimum of and maximum of experts varela ruiz et al for this research two types of experts defined by álvarez torado thus the first type caled afected are key experts who regardles of their titles or hierarchical position they have participated in proceses diagnoses or involved in similar

the expert with each of them completely disagre in disagre neither agre nor disagre agre totaly agre agrement each qualification had to be justified factors that influence the digital transformation in the institutions of higher education national university of colombia bogotá headquarters aplication of the questionaire for the first round of the delphi method experts were contacted via email electronic which met the criteria mentioned above for this they were sent an invitation in which the title of the research was mentioned which is why which they were invited as experts and in general the delphi method in adition they were asked to confirm their wilingnes and availability to participate in the research the questionaire was also atached which had parts namely title of the

analyzed through central tendency statistics such as the median and position statistics such as quartiles and zapata ebrero these data alowed us to observe the information about the distribution of the responses of the group of experts it wil also be used measures of dispersion such as the interquartile range ri and the standard deviation table the interquartile range ir was defined as consensus measure zapata ebrero this reveals the degre of dispersion of the experts responses and is determined like this rir median the degre of consensus is presented with range low interquartile zapata ebrero rir it is considered to exist consensus the consensus levels were established as folows high consensus when rir aceptable consensus for rir and rir and low consensus for rir table degre of

leadership subfactor and the resistance to change subfactor thus with the values of the median and the standard deviation it is confirmed that the organizational culture factor is the factor that most influences the digital transformation proces aditionaly in the questionaire of this first round the experts were asked if they in their opinion they considered that there were other factors other than those mentioned they could include them the experts included factors table factors that influence the digital transformation in the institutions of higher education national university of colombia bogotá headquarters table factors that were evaluated in the first round and factors included by the experts factors evaluated factors included by the by expert experts digital strategy context organizational culture change management resistance to change busines architecture lead zgo inovation digital expertise technological infrastructure organizational flexibility colaboration customer orientation qualitative analysis of the first round once the experts responses have ben consolidated the justification given by the experts against each factor they evaluated organizational culture factor this factor obtained the highest consensus and the lowest dispersion of responses among experts folowed by its two subfactors resistance to change and leadership this shows that experts fuly agre that this factor influences digital transformation proces one expert highlighted that digital transformation is not mater of technology it is organizational isue that involves the culture of the organization another expert in turn pointed out that public higher education institutions are very traditional who live in contact with the most recent advances in science culture and art which generates tension betwen traditional and change requiring an efort to change organizational also in general experts asociate organizational culture with the people and their behavior in the organization one expert indicated that the values and staf beliefs can facilitate or hinder the digital transformation of the company organization and more so in the case of public heis where the staf

people are the main axis of the digital transformation as one expert pointed out every digital transformation proces in an hei you must kep in mind natural element in people and that is resistance to the change this management must be caried out by an interdisciplinary team leadership subfactor the experts considered the leadership subfactor important and influential within digital transformation proces one expert mentioned that without leadership it is dificult said proces regarding the responsibility of leading the proces of transformation an expert indicated it must be led from the rectorship of the ies furthermore the experts highlighted that leadership must be focused on people and their transformation which is not something easy or imediate it must be led by team factors that

institution superior the available technologies and the subsystems that make up the organization this with the aim of meting its proposed objectives optimizing its performance and its competitive advantage is maintained so that it is sustainable in the future time on the other hand another expert highlighted that digital strategy is not enough as factor of influence digital strategy is insuficient beyond strategy it must there is digital transformation policy within the ies as vital input and guide to begin this transformation proces another expert pointed out that the digital strategy is an articulating element the digital strategy positively influences in digital transformation if it is thought of in an integral and holistic way within the ies and subsequently this strategy responds to the mision and vision of an ies digitaly transformed digital expertise among the factors that were evaluated this factor obtained the lowest consensus and high dispersion in responses which indicates that it is not an influential factor within digital transformation proces one expert highlighted that digital expertise is valuable for adequate construction and direction of the digital transformation helps to avoid making the mistakes that other institutions have experienced however if it is not available it can be acquire on the other hand another expert focused on the atitude with which the digital transformation expertise helps face cultural change with confidence its importance is not so much or in the ease of implementing digital solutions but in the atitude with which the proces is aproached regarding the capabilities and skils of the staf one expert mentioned that the diferent roles involved in digital transformation in an hei require an analysis thorough analysis of the capabilities skils and knowledge they must have and in this measure training and guiding human resources to reach the required level other expert emphasized the isue of training within transformation proces training may be neded on the use and apropriation of the new technologies although it is not determining factor for the transformation in complement another expert pointed out if the personel has capabilities and skils they can be create transformations from the botom up however les aligned and eficient in cost but somehow efective organizational flexibility this factor like the previous one is among the factors with the least consensus among the experts which indicates that it is not an influential factor within proces of digital

generate comunications and responses agile which is what is realy important colaboration this factor among the factors that were evaluated obtained an aceptable level of consensus and the greatest dispersion of the answers given the aproach that each of the experts adopted this consensus may indicate that this factor has litle influence within proces of digital transformation among the justifications given by the experts one of them mentioned that the colaboration is not factor but an institutional value this factor should be institutional value which must be given in al areas of the heis for this they must break the bariers that exist in the dependencies so that the proces of digital transformation can ocur on the other hand an expert highlighted that the colaboration must be focused and articulated to the digital strategy to satisfy the neds of its users another expert focused on the it area el it department must transition from being suport proces and become one strategic more than colaboration we must talk about an integration and holistic view of the organization customer orientation this factor obtains high level of consensus which indicates that it is factor that influences in digital transformation regarding this factor an expert considered that it is not factor that influences the digital transformation he highlights that the public university market is captive so they do not ned to compete as hard and therefore do not consider that it has an influence without however there is also market in other lines such as extension and research which are becomes more demanding and wil put presure on the transformation and even the internal client who expects beter service from the university itself on the other hand some experts indicated their opinions regarding the types of client expert mentioned in public hei it is necesary to define who the client is and what independent of what is considered the customer in digital transformation proces the stakeholders of the institution and the members must be put first of the university comunity another expert highlighted that when talking about clients these are of two types internal and external the first are the same colaborators and workers the later it is important to ad value to them and for them to perceive the improvements in proceses procedures and provision of services along

ebrero on the factors that influence the digital transformation of public education institutions superior to do this second questionaire was developed which was presented to each expert the response he reported against each factor that was evaluated in the first round and was asked to confirm or modify that answer also know provided the analysis that was caried out based on the justification of the responses of the experts for each factor evaluated likewise al factors were evaluated again in the second gives round although in the first round would have obtained high level of consensus such is the case of the factors organizational culture resistance to change leadership customer orientation and digital strategy table aditionaly the new factors were included proposed by the experts in that first round context change management technological infrastructure busines architecture and inovation with their respective description the experts who responded to the first round questionaire were sent email where they were requested to participate in the completion of the second round questionaire the aces link to it was included there through from the gogle forms aplication these experts

fluctuate betwen and which places the responses in total agrement acording to the opinions of the experts of the factors and subfactors that were identified in the first round and were re evaluated in the second round al obtained high level of consensus among the experts minus the colaboration factor which may indicate that these factors influence notoriously in digital transformation proces in public hei the factor colaboration in the two rounds obtained an aceptable level of consensus which indicates of factors that influence the digital transformation in the institutions of higher education national university of colombia bogotá headquarters acording to experts it is factor that has litle influence on transformation proces digital in an hei regarding the justification of the new factors that were identified in the first round the experts mentioned the folowing context factor this factor obtained an aceptable consensus among the experts and high dispersion of its results responses some experts mentioned that it is factor that can lead to influence the digital transformation but not be relevant and that the context can motivate the ned to adopt or develop new technologies within said transformation in this sense several experts highlighted that this factor influences the transformation digital which mention public heis present very diverse contexts in where cultures and diferent ways of thinking come together which influences the digital transformation and the university as an organization is not an isolated entity and requires interaction with its environment as established by the general theory of systems and the theory of organizational ecology the sector generates synergy with the organization an expert pointed out that this factor influences digital transformation the context has high influence on the digital transformation of heis because the later they must respond almost imediately to met your requirements otherwise it is exposed to non compliance and latent risk of disapearing he you can se how the pandemic forced heis to rethink themselves imediately and find solutions albeit temporary through technology to provide coverage of his service to the comunity on the other hand another expert highlighted that the characteristics of the sector can make it dificult to digital transformation the university as it belongs to the public sector the dynamics of this sector are often not articulated and are far from the dynamics typical of some of organizations in the sector that dispersed and isolated vision along with the lack of integrated and interoperable mechanisms can make it dificult to cary out efective the digital transformation proces in the description of this factor it was mentioned aspects such as the acreditation of the cna or public sector regulations are obstacles to overcome in proces of digital transformation regarding this several experts considered that this factor litle influences the digital transformation and they highlighted the folowing the proceses of quality have indicators other than those of eficiency and efectivenes inherent to the digital transformation god practices are not obstacles to carying out digital transformation proces this would help in methods and procedures to adopt beter digital strategy change management factor this factor obtained an aceptable consensus among the experts and the greatest dispersion of the responses among al the factors that were evaluated this was evident in the justifications given by the experts who focused mainly on aspects how to handle transformation that of people the it area and the use of technologies thus two experts mentioned that the change management factor is not factor but tol since resistance to change was already included as factor consider which is not an independent factor but tol to resolve the influence negative that resistance can bring and change management plan alows facilitate asimilation within the organization and thus generate beter adaptation simple another expert highlighted that this factor is closely asociated with it management this factor afects the it management proceses of organizations because it relates the importance of analyzing the risks those responsible and the impacts of change at the it level however at the university this proces is not so strict because the it changes without the planing and analysis that should compromise strict proces factors that influence digital transformation in it institutions higher education national university of colombia bogotá headquarters change management another expert highlighted that the change management factor involves people and proceses change management not only involves modifying or adapt the use of technologies within the organization also involves the people and proceses which wil be impacted during the adoption of said technologies which is why it is necesary to aply adequate management of that stage of transition involving al interested parties faced with this factor and the implementation of technologies an expert pointed out that although digital transformation is an organizational transformation its suces is based on the implementation of corectly managed technologies also another expert highlighted that our heis are conservative and the majority of its members are formed in period where others had to adjust to the demands of the one who has the control for this reason without change management towards service and colaboration digital transformation may be afected technological infrastructure factor this factor obtained an aceptable consensus among the experts and high dispersion of the responses among al the factors that were evaluated this was evident in the justifications given by experts one expert mentioned that technological infrastructure is not relevant factor in the digital transformation he considers that it is an important but not suficient condition infrastructure is important for the institution however the transformation digital is more of culture of service and colaboration than of device use for him on the contrary one expert considered that inovations in infrastructure such as cloud can alone motivate transformation likewise another expert stated it is important to have the adequate resources and infrastructure that suports the pro transformation proces otherwise it wil not be posible to respond to the parties interested and involved on the other hand an expert highlighted that it must be taken into acount that infrastructure is very diverse in our country and by region there is diferent reality in the case of these heis are located in remote regions that have notable dificulties in along the same lines an expert emphasized that this factor alows establishing strategies of apropriation as wel as estimating costs enterprise architecture factor this factor which was evaluated in the second round obtained high level of consensus among the experts which is why it can be considered an influential factor in digital transformation in public heis this is how an expert mentioned regarding this factor that heis usualy have conventional organizational model that has evolved litle in the last years and that it is time to imagine new heis from scratch also another expert considered that the enterprise architecture facilitates decision making enterprise architecture gives the north and the focus in an articulated and integrated maner which facilitates decision making and the definition of apropriate strategies to cary out the changes in the diferent domains proceses information systems and technological infrastructure another expert highlighted that at the national university of colombia in particular there is no busines architecture in the university there is no defined enterprise architecture there are defined quality proceses although they are not articulated strategies that are not always aplied at the national level and the technology is dispersed which means that this busines architecture map is not defined at the level national and does not influence decisions on digital transformation at the university for his part another expert pointed out that enterprise architecture is tol enterprise architecture is tol and also necesary in proces of sucesful technological transformation but do not consider that it is the tol that influences the transformation however they also mentioned that as tol alows orchestrate the elements involved in this transformation factors that influence the digital transformation in the institutions of higher education national university of colombia bogotá headquarters on the other hand one expert indicated that even though enterprise architecture is key within the digital transformation it is not the center of it inovation factor this factor obtained an aceptable consensus rir among the experts and one of the greater dispersions of responses among al the factors that were evaluated thus an expert mentioned that inovation helps in improvement and change organizational within digital transformation proces as long as it is planed cordinated and organized another expert also highlighted that the novation is driving element of digital transformation inovation is principle potentialy presedimenting within an organization which motivates to think and do things diferently to achieve objectives that benefit it in that sense think that it clearly influences perhaps as the element that drives digital transformation likewise another expert highlighted that digital transformation must alow heis respond very quickly to the demands of changing market and in some cases unpredictable therefore it is important to consider inovation as key piece to survive in the market and contribute significantly to said transformation along the same lines an expert mentioned that culture of inovation in hei is esential to imagine services that make life easier and enable the development of the agents that comprise it on the other hand an expert points out that inovation is not factor that influences digital transformation inovation is not factor that influences the transformation digital but it is part of said transformation research results once the questionaires from the first and second round were

factors in digital transformation in institutions public higher education the factors digital expertise and organizational flexibility which in the first round obtained an aceptable level of consensus for the second round they reached level of high consensus which may indicate that these two factors can also influence the digital transformation on the other hand the colaboration factor in both rounds obtained aceptable level of consensus which may indicate acording to experts that this factor litle influence on digital transformation regarding the factors that the experts identified in the first round and that were evaluated in the second round the busines architecture factor obtained level of high consensus which indicates that it is factor that also influences the transformation digital the other factors context inovation change management and infrastructure factors that influence the digital transformation in the institutions of higher education national university of colombia bogotá headquarters technology obtained an aceptable level of consensus which indicates that they are factors which acording to experts have litle influence on the digital transformation in public heis on the other hand almost at the end of the aplication of the delphi method of this research declared the covid pandemic literature review was caried out on this aspect in heis authors such as eradze et al and morales et al state that situations such as pandemic could be factor that influences and acelerates proces of digital transformation in an hei leading to fundamental changes in the teaching evolving towards an online teaching learning scenario this new factor opens new research on digital transformation isues given the recent and new change for higher education caused by the pandemic the pandemic generated suden and forced closure of in person teaching leading to teachers and students to unknown terain due to the ned to adapt rapidly to digital learning environments caled online education of emergency this abrupt change has forced universities to evolve towards online teaching in record time implementing and adapting resources available technological resources as wel as involving teachers and researchers who they lack technological capabilities for online teaching morales et al the transition from in person education to virtual education wil have implications significant for the entire learning proces it wil not only modify the methods to evaluate learning outcomes but wil also require review of the skils and comp skils required of students in this new environment likewise there must be adequate infrastructure and technological platforms blackboard modle microsoft teams and servers that alow sustain the virtual workload morales et al for example in the most universities signed contracts with companies like microsoft that provided ofice or teams resources or technological platforms to strengthen the virtual teaching morales et al it is highlighted that in the case of public universities aditionaly they wil have to dealing with declining budgets due to reduced government funding united to the decrease in student enrolment due to the curent economic situation uncertain then some investments wil be neded to improve these capabilities techniques morales et al factors that influence the digital transformation in the institutions of higher education national university of colombia bogotá headquarters conclusions and recomendations in this chapter the results of the research are presented in sumary from the question and its objectives developed through multimethodology by mingers and the case study by yin conclusions the general objective of this research work is to identify the factors that influence the digital transformation in higher education institutions and thre specific objectives emerge from this for its development the multimethodology proposed by mingers the case study designed by yin and the method delphi for the development of objective no systematic review of the literature on the term digital transformation the databases yielded results asociated with this is mainly in the industrial sector this alowed us to identify definitions impacts chalenges and mainly the factors that influence proces of digital transformation the review of the literature in relation to institutions of higher education some universities were identified that have implemented strategies and new proceses with the introduction of technologies as part of their digital transformation proces regarding the factors that influence digital transformation six were identified organizational culture customer orientation digital strategy colaboration expertise digital and organizational flexibility and subfactors resistance to change and leadership which are part of the organizational culture factor it should be noted that in the case of institutions of higher education was not clearly evidenced in the literature the factors that can influence digital transformation proces for the specific objective no the factors that were identified in the objective were taken no and the characterization of each of them was caried out for this was taken into acount the features and specifications mentioned by the authors in each article analyzed finaly for objective no the factors that were identified and characterized in the previous objectives through experts who are part of the national university of colombia bogotá headquarters in order to achieve the objective developed questionaire that is part of the first round of the delphi method which it contained the factors and subfactors identified and which were subjected to evaluation by the selected experts as result of this first round the experts included new factors context busines architecture inovation product management change and technological infrastructure table factors that were identified in the rsl and those proposed by the experts factors identified in the rsl factors proposed by experts organizational culture context resistance to change busines architecture leadership inovation customer orientation change management digital strategy technological infrastructure colaboration digital expertise organizational flexibility once the two rounds of evaluation with experts have ben aplied the factors that obtained greater consensus and were defined as the factors that most influence the digital transformation in public institution of higher education are the folowing in order of consensus table factors that influence the digital transformation in the institutions of higher education national university of colombia bogotá headquarters table factors that influence digital transformation in an hei factor level of influence organizational culture very influential resistance to change very influential very influential leadership customer orientation very influential digital strategy very influential digital expertise very influential organizational flexibility very influential enterprise architecture very influential colaboration not very influential context not very influential inovation litle influential change management not very influential technological infrastructure litle influential the identification of these factors provides an answer to those responsible for the implementation of digital transformation as mentioned by hes et al the most of those responsible for this transformation lack clarity about the diferent options and elements that must be considered as consequence run the risk of not considering important elements or ignoring solutions that are more favorable for specific situation of the organization as result of the evaluation by experts it can be concluded that the factors identified in the research are aplicable to digital transformation proces in higher education institution in this case public hei finaly factor that can influence digital transformation proces and that can make it worse are exceptional situations like pandemic since like it hapened in in few weks changes were necesary in the sector educational especialy in heis from face to face teaching proces to one of type virtual mobilizing the entire organization to new educational and organizational proces with the suport of its technological infrastructure recomendations this research was caried out to respond to the ned of how to start digital transformation proces in higher education institution ies identifying the factors that influence this transformation although this research has as case study the national university of colombia headquarters bogotá for future studies it is proposed to aply the delphi method and the asociated questionaires for the other campuses of the university and thus confirm the factors that can influence digital transformation in public hei even count with greater participation of experts not only belonging to an hei but also external experts who are working on this topic in the educational sector this wil alow us to depen and consolidate these factors and the identification of new factors on the other hand at the end of the aplication of the delphi methodology the researcher had aces to information on the proces that is being caried out of digital transformation in the national university of colombia in which they identified factors of change described in section for this reason these factors were not taken into acount acount in the present research which provides an oportunity for future investigations that alow contrasting the factors that have ben identified in this institution and the results of this investigation and that can influence said transformation proces in the medium term it is proposed to aply the proposed questionaires under the delphi method in private and oficial higher education institutions to contrast the factors identified that influence digital transformation and thus obtain general overview in the colombian context factors that influence the digital transformation in the institutions of higher education national university of colombia bogotá headquarters also it is proposed to investigate how exceptional situations such as pandemic and in especialy the one caused by covid could influence digital transformation proces in an hei finaly in the long term it is proposed with these identified factors and other factors that identify with experts model for adopting digital transformation in heis that alows evaluating these factors anex questionaires used in the delphi method

transformation dt emerges as proces of incremental disruptive change which begins with the adoption and use of digital technologies then evolves towards deliberate holistic conversion of an organization in the pursuit of creating worth however this path of transformation is not simple so the organizations ned roadmap through which they plan and control said management emerging td maturity models as tol for said functionality under this ned study was caried out in colombian organization in which the evaluation of its td capacity is adresed identifying how this proces has ben developed from the dimensions strategy tasks culture people structure so that it reaches new stage in which digital technologies don limit yourself to separate divisions chanels or functions but are used throughout the entire organization to suport corporate strategies based on the conception that efective digital culture is an intentional and global efort suported by its human talent the

triger permutations in the value chain with oportunities for market but also with chalenges and competitive presures that require constant technological update aleksev et al gils weigand sewpersadh with positive impacts on the environment in acordance with what is indicated by eclac digital technologies can contribute significantly to promoting the thre dimensions of sustainable development stimulating growth equality and sustainability figure dimensions of digital development and its disruptive efects source adapted from eclac introduction problem statement acording to authors such as alkan cheng et al frank et al guo et al feng li peng tao salume et al shahi sinha and sousa et al romero et al at the time of launching the transformation digital in organizations does not take into acount whether they are prepared to cary out this proces of metamorphosis from strategic busines philosophy that internalize change and inovation sustainable economic situation and culture organizational aceptance of new technologies carijo et al ghobakhlo iranmanesh gils weigand heredia et al mihardjo et al venkateswaran jyotishi that is initiating this disruptive and holistic proces without clear objective beyond acquiring new technologies that improve some operation or that promote the idea of being company at the technological forefront afects the result end of this management proces minimizing it to the purchase of new technology which in in many cases it is not aligned with the reality of the company alkan cale et al frank et al ghobakhlo fathi gileva et al gils weigand guo et al leonardus et al salume et al sousa et al the digital display ofers facilities that do not go hand in hand with the actual operation of many companies which folow the precepts and paradigms from their culture organizational and static and myopic management bordeleau felden feliciano cestero et al guo et al nerima ralyté shahi sinha yamamoto and instead of geting performance and productivity improvements they end up with acquisitions high cost technological technologies to continue with the same gaps that distance the organization of competitivenes optimization and efectivenes caputo et al carijo et al cheng et al de carolis et al gils weigand hanelt et al nerima ralyté reyes et al salume et al sheng et al as digital investments increase companies face paradox of digitization and canot receive the coresponding return but companies that properly performed digital investments can achieve god returns brozi et al cheng et al feliciano cestero et al mahraz et al shahi sinha teubner due to the negative efects of digital transformation short sighted managers may delay its implementation while the efects positive results lead to excesive digital transformation cheng et al guo et al in this way managerial myopia moderates the relationship betwen digital transformation introduction and company performance aghamiri et al guo et al heredia et al sheng et al this situation is agravated by not knowing the curent organizational status or situation without be able to chart path of progres and move incrementaly towards higher degre of digital transformation maturity aghamiri et al brozi et al frank et al ismagilova et al reyes et al strutynska et al likewise this ignorance of the level of maturity of digital transformation in organizations limits its ability to progresively evolve in the development of key capabilities to be sucesful in the new digital era cheng et al christensen et al gileva et al haryanti et al ismagilova et al lorenzo ochoa saleh awny seyedghorban et al sousa zomer et al sousa et al usai et al in sumary the problem that is adresed in this final master thesis is that there is the ned for organizations to evaluate their proceses to discover how they are prepared for digital transformation and how to develop your roadmap se figure in acordance with the principle of the systemic aproach of continuous improvement where if they are not measured or they evaluate the proceses there are no fedback proceses from the various problems indicated here several research questions arise such as how the organization strategic planing should be designed for the achievement of digital transformation what is the apropriate route to folow for the transformation digital why do organizations limit digital transformation to achieving only digitize and or digitization what is the ideal situation for company to cary out the digital transformation what factors and variables triger the generation of digital companies and their sustainability over time what is the degre of maturity of the digital transformation of an organization among others however the research question adresed in this final master thesis is what is the degre of maturity of an organization digital transformation acording to riascos gonzález the proces of measurement analysis and improvement is very important given that what it canot be measured it canot be improved and acording to wiliam thomson kelvin lord kelvin physicist and mathematician british what is not defined canot be measured what is not measured can not be improved it if it is not improved it is always degraded albrecht brumet mulins komisar introduction figure causation framework and problem impact source self made in this argument of the identified problem colombia although it has made progres in consolidation of more proactive and eficient public entities which apropriate and use the information and comunications technologies ict to provide beter services to citizens and optimaly resolve their neds from the government strategy introduction online and with the deployment of the digital government policy pgd since mintic acording to the digital government index during the period national entities have only managed to gain on average points in the implementation of the pgd for their part the teritorial entities have advanced in average points in the implementation of the pgd mintic even though the public digital transformation was established as priority for the government in the plan national development pact for colombia pact for equity and in the articles and of law of dnp mintic with the update of the digital government policy through decre of mintic colombia seks to direct itself in achieving this objective with this evolution the pgd seks to make more digital state reality for this reason for the country it is public digital transformation is esential to make colombia reality modern and competitive understanding it as the proces of exploitation of technologies digital technologies that have the ability to create new ways of doing things in al sectors of public administration generating new development models proceses and the creation of products and services which in turn produce value mainly through of digitization that represents the conversion of data and analog proceses towards formats that can be understod and procesed by machine inas mintic now acording to the objective of copes to increase the generation of social value and economic through the digital transformation of the public sector and the private sector through the reduction of bariers the strengthening of human capital and the development of enabling conditions so that colombia can take advantage of the oportunities and face the chalenges related to the fourth industrial revolution dnp the organization where the digital transformation maturity model mtd was aplied as it was public in nature of regional order and the manager to secondary education in the capital in charge of promote educational oferings the quality and relevance of education guide and lead the formulation and execution of policies plans and programs to guarante the right to education recognizes this objective and aligns it with the digital government policy and the national development plan colombia world power of life dnp in this desire of the organization where the mtd was aplied to promote the use and taking advantage of information and comunications technologies to consolidate competitive proactive and inovative state and citizens that generate public valueintroduction in an environment of digital trust since its management mintic recognizes its ned to constantly evaluate your digital transformation proces to identify oportunities for improvement that wil sucesfuly lead to the achievement of this objective and the establishment of roadmap that alows the planing of the proces its execution controled and measurable the optimization of the resources that fed it and the obtaining of the best posible results goals to answer the research question the folowing objectives have ben established general objective analyze the degre of maturity of an organization digital transformation specific objectives characterize the methods models for measuring the maturity of the transformation digital from literature review aply the method or model for measuring the maturity of the digital transformation more apropriate to the organization propose recomendations to the organization to improve its level of maturity of the digital transformation based on the results of the aplication design of the investigation to achieve the proposed objectives the development of descriptive study was established since this type of study is aimed at measuring the presence characteristics or distribution of phenomenon in an organization at moment of cut over time limiting itself to describing one or several phenomena without the intention of establishing causal relationships with other factors veiga de cabo et al in turn it is considered that there was no intentional manipulation only the phenomena were observed as they were gave in their natural context the type and research design of the final work mastery was non experimental se figure introduction the research aproach used in this final master thesis was mixed se figure since quantitative and qualitative techniques were combined to obtain the information necesary to respond to the objectives of the study creswel john creswel creswel tashakori tedlie consequently for to achieve the objectives thre phases were executed namely characterization of the model of maturity of digital transformation mtd in which the methods models for measuring the degre of suces in the strategic change proces of adoption and use of digital technologies based on systematic literature review rsl and the mtd to be aplied in the organization under study was defined estimate the level of maturity of the digital transformation through the aplication of the maturity model of the digital transformation mtd most suitable for the organization and data analysis obtained and recomendations in which recomendations were generated to the organization to improve your level of digital transformation maturity based on the results of the aplication for each organizational dimension evaluated acording to the selected mtd figure research design source self made main results the main result is the analysis of the degre of maturity of the transformation digital of an organization once the selected mtd was aplied as result of study based on the characterization from an rsl of the methods and models of introduction measurement of the maturity of the digital transformation and the particularities of the entity simultaneously this characterization of the mtd in itself is result of the work final master degre by studying maturity models that provide tol for apropriation of knowledge for the field of study and aplication to finaly deliver recomendations to the organization that improve its degre of advance or development in the use and apropriation of technology and digital data in maner planed and controled in search of optimization of its performance competitivenes evolution of its functional structures and the creation of new busines models that generate products or reformed organizational structures based on results by dimensions of analysis of the aplied mtd strategy tasks culture human talent and structure likewise it is worth highlighting that the defined methodology of the mtd was enriched selected by grouping the questions from your information colection tol acording to its dimensions and ad gap analysis in which state is defined ideal and an objective state to then define oportunities for improvement this final master thesis is structured in six chapters that develop they cal theoretical and aplication foundations to provide solutions to your specific objectives of subsequently in the introductory section the problem is explained the question of research objectives research design main results and limitations along with anexes that complement its development chapter defines the state of the art defined based on review exercise of literature through which the theoretical foundation of the final work is structured in chapter an analysis and clasification of the maturity models of digital transformation mtd in order to define which is the most apropriate to aply acording to the characteristics of the organization that is the subject of the final master thesis chapter contains the adoption of the selected mtd through adjustments made to the model tols for adaptation to the singularities of the target organization study in chapter the aplication of the mtd is caried out acording to the proposed methodological design these results define the advances and gaps in the organizational path of the proces of digital transformation chapter establishes recomendations for the organization to improve its level of digital transformation maturity based on the results of the aplication for each introduction one of the study dimensions and in acordance with the gap analysis methodology raised and finaly chapter presents the conclusions that describe how the proposed objectives were met the advantage of using the design of the chosen research the contrast of the research design and the practical environment the impact of the research for the practical and study context the limitations found and future work and posible lines of research digital transformation state of art this chapter aims to describe the key concepts characteristics constructs importance and impacts of digital transformation this chapter is made up of the folowing sections first that describes the method of the systematic review of literature rsl to obtain information and its subsequent analysis in the second section the diference betwen digital transformation and digitalization from the change in strategic thinking towards organizational competitivenes the third section focuses on the relationship existing betwen digital transformation strategic planing and the value chain the digital transformation in the colombian context is shown in the fourth section and sumary of the chapter is provided in the fifth section method to achieve the proposed objective for this chapter the review method was used systematics of literature rsl proposed by kitchenham et al and expanded by galvis lista sánchez tores and sánchez tores miles in which define thre stages planing information search and structuring of the state of the art the steps for each stage are in figure planing the information search acording to galvis lista sánchez tores kitchenham et al and sánchez tores miles in the identification of search neds they established six guiding questions which are listed below what is digital transformation and digitization analysis of the degre of maturity of the digital transformation of an organization what is the diference betwen digital transformation and digitization what is the relationship betwen strategic planing and digital transformation how are the value chain and digital transformation related what are the keys to suces for digital transformation what is the panorama of digital transformation in colombia figure method for defining chapter source adapted from galvis lista sánchez tores kitchenham et al sánchez tores miles as quality criteria for the selection of studies related to transformation digital were defined level of explanation of the topic ofered by the study degre of relationship with the topics of interest and results and conclusions of the study as wel as the bibliography used for the clasification of studies related to maturity models of digital transformation the quality criteria for the selection were the degre of description of the model level of clarity and impartiality in obtaining analyzing and presentation of results if the study presents the method of aplication of the model and model validation methods chapter search for information in this stage search strategy was built iteratively with terms asociated with digital transformation digitization and maturity models that was executed in the scopus database limited betwen and se

type of analysis of the degre of maturity of the digital transformation of an organization organization and earns the maturity model score of zero not suitable and one suitable the selection criteria were aplied at two levels the first where the criterion was used and the second level of selection in which criteria and were used to obtain the mtd that is going to be aplied in the organization se figure figure selection of digital transformation maturity models source self made for the level two selection of the mtd the information contained in the shets was studied of mtd characterization which are presented in anex if you have tie it was defined that the mtds that have the same scoring based on the previous selection procedure but executed by set of experts on the subject and subsequently weighting of the total scores generated by the group of experts for each mtd that is the asesment given by each expert in the thre criteria wil be aded and then averaged based on the number of experts who participated in the qualification of each of the mtd in tie chapter the asesment of these criteria is presented in the model selection matrix digital transformation maturity mtd se table in the total score column the total values of the clasification are observed of the mtd shortlisted acording to criterion six mtds were obtained with the highest score awarded by the clasification of criteria and these maturity models also showed tie each other in this case in which tie was generated in the highest total scores awarded acording to the mtd selection criteria second round was caried out of analysis and selection of the mtd with the highest scores based on the criteria already established and jointly with the experts of this master work director and co director and the organization digital transformation representative due to his technical and profesional knowledge on the subject and the entity kep in mind that for the final selection of the mtd the grades awarded by the experts director and co director of the master degre work and the representative in td of the organization where the chosen mtd was aplied al identified with the acronym ex expert were averaged to have the total score these experts were selected for having the knowledge and expertise in the field of digital transformation both at an academic and profesional level and on the organization by meting the folowing characteristics have knowledge and training in areas related to digital transformation have expertise in the digital transformation proces planing execution control and evaluation manage knowledge regarding digital transformation have knowledge of the organization where the chosen mtd was aplied and its direction in maters of digital transformation characterization of maturity models digital transformation the maturity of topic refers to the state of being very advanced or developed for an east and is structured in set of dimensions that together describe the its entirety golhardt et al thus maturity models are analysis of the degre of maturity of the digital transformation of an organization tol used to evaluate qualitative and quantitative capabilities through series of sequential levels which together form an anticipated logical path or desired from an initial state to final state of maturity carijo et al proença borbinha the ms with their organized and systemic structure alow companies evaluate diferent aspects of the organization and compare their levels of maturity with its competitors and with those who present the best practices of the market which makes it posible to develop action guides to reach the highest levels high market maturity carijo et al proença borbinha along these lines digital transformation maturity models mtd help to understand and structure the concept of digitalization carijo et al and provide an estimate of the curent capabilities and maturity of organizations and general directions towards the desired level of maturity de carolis et al schumacher et al roy wend ler the mtd must consider the diferences of the industries and their stages of development so that their diagnosis and clasification of the maturity level are related to the reality of the organization aghamiri et al carijo et al reyes et al because the digital transformation has diferent efects in diferent industries and those with customer orientation and relationship busines to consumer bc are afected by digitalization faster and much more than those with busines to busines relationships carijo et al demlehner laumer the authors becker et al de carolis et al nerima ralyté and soares et al define that mtds can serve thre functionalities diferent descriptive those that analyze the level of maturity and the curent objective of the company prescriptive those that present guides for the company to achieve the desired level of maturity focuses on the relationships of the domain with performance and indicates how to aproach improving maturity to positively afect the value of the busines and comparative when comparing the curent level with the market benchmarking and the maturity levels of competitors model of this nature could compare similar practices betwen organizations to compare maturity within diferent industries however the mtd may be descriptive by design but may develop roadmap and present the consequences of its comparative aplication golhardt et al another clasification of mtds is provided by golhardt et al who state that in general two types of mtd can be distinguished the aproachchapter quite clasicaly specifies individual maturity in the form of fixed levels where the scale five levels is the most comon these fixed levels can be stagered or continuous and focus area maturity models on the other hand each criterion can have disparate levels of maturity in terms of quantity and distance from each other van stenbergen et al based on the rsl

with deloite developed anual survey of executives managers and busines analysts from organizations acros the world which gave way to mtd aligning the organization for its digital future by kane et al focused on carying out measurements such as digital maturity level of the organization anticipate the interuption prepare adequately the bigest threat your company faces as result of the digital trend percentage of profesionals who want to leave their organization in les than year given digital trends most important technology for the organization today analysis of the degre of maturity of the digital transformation of an organization ion the organization digital strategy is early developing or mature percentage of respondents who agre strongly agre rating of the company culture on scale of to how companies strengthen their digital inovation capabilities most important skil an organizational leader must have to be sucesful in digital workplace talent neds vs atraction capacity dimensions of digital transformation maturity to navigate the complexity of digital busines companies must adopt the that kane et al caled digital congruence culture people structure and tasks aligned with each other so that executives can efectively adres the chalenges of constantly changing digital landscape culture acept risk geting an organization to acept risk goes beyond warnings that taking risks is aceptable organizations that mature digitaly incorporate risk taking into the fabric of how they manage kane et al people depening the company skils companies that mature digitaly are more than five times more likely to provide employes with oportunities to develop digital skils necesary than early stage companies early stage companies on the contrary they depend on consultants and contractors although this may be means excelent at suporting eforts from the begining relying solely on help external should only be provisional measure kane et al the talent shortage wil continue to grow and employes and executives who do not fel those who acquire digital skils wil lok for this elsewhere therefore the digitaly maturing organizations do more than ofer training courses with the increasing presure to perform and the acelerated pace of change brought about by digital technology the most powerful way to learn is not to aces what others people already know but rather encourage the creation of new knowledge through chapter practice in the workplace itself rather than in training rom kane et al figure digital congruence digital transformation maturity dimensions source taken from kane et al structure adaptive and agile hierarchical leadership structures were designed for complex organizations in more stable times to become more agile and foster colaboration some large organizations simplify their structures and turn to cros functional teams to become more agile and let formal structures fade into background or disapear completely this is acompanied by the fact that leaders can establish high level guidelines that can then be aplied by local units and functions to adapt ideas to your problems more and neds kane et al tasks contingent workforces and customized work the complex and lengthy selection and background check proceses permanent and temporary jobs wil not be able to kep up with al the neds of talent in rapidly changing environments often the best talent is not located within the four wals of an organization and not everyone loks for fixes analysis of the degre of maturity of the digital transformation of an organization traditional employment growing field of companies are adapting to these trends and provide aces to selected independent talent who are acesed as service that conects and plays with the work of the organization and the hiring proceses kane et al the chalenge is having the right person with the right skils in the right place at the apropriate time that alows the efectivenes of the organization here they come to play factors of work organization in acordance with the capabilities of the company which met your specific neds suported by suitable human talent and eliminating unecesary activities within proceses and procedures kane et al strategy leading into the future evolving to compete in an increasingly digital world is not just about implement more and beter technologies it involves aligning the company organization with the demands of the digital environment by increasing risk apetite investing in digital oportunities for your employes optimize organizational structures to achieve agility and rethink how and by whom work is done only when these factors organizational organizations come together the company can go from being digital to being transformed digitaly however since these factors are not aligned the eforts of digitalization can do litle to improve company ability to compete in digital world even if the technology investment and implementation are corect kane et al nadler tushman spearheaded the idea of organizational congruence as main ingredient for optimal corporate performance the concept is that only when the esential components of busines its culture people structure and tasks are closely aligned the company can achieve powerful results kane et al in an ever changing digital landscape the concept of congruence takes on new meaning and relevance since many companies do not they ensure that al elements of the organization work together over time as much as posible that does not favor the integration of your digital strategy with that of the busines chapter digital transformation maturity levels kane et al defined thre levels of digital transformation maturity early developing and maturing with based on scale of rating from to in which it is evaluated that both the company is considered as ideal organization transformed by digital technologies and capabilities that improve proceses atract talent acros the organization and drive new busines models that generate value where not close means that the study company is not for nothing or very litle similar to this ideal organization and very close that the company study is very similar or equal to this ideal organization se figure in more detail about the maturity levels for this model it is considered that the digitaly maturing companies closely link their digital strategies with the overal strategy of their company and also have longer term vision of strategy compared to early stage companies kane et al regarding culture there are thre diferent mentalities that are closely related with the stages of digital maturity the first mentality is comon among early stage digital organizations and is characterized by low apetite for risk hierarchical leadership structure work done in silos and decisions based more in instinct than in data on the contrary the cultural mentalities that relate closely to companies that mature digitaly value the experimentation and sped acept risk and create leadership structures distributed aditionaly they encourage colaboration and are more likely to use data in the decision making in the midle are the cultures on the way from the first group to the third kane et al talent development is an important element of the culture in organizations that mature digitaly who place decisive emphasis on developing existing talent and recruit new talent while early stage companies are more likely to resort to contractors and consultants kane et al companies that mature digitaly are significantly more capable of atracting new talent based on their use of digital in contrast to early stage organizations which tend to rely on external parties to suport your digital eforts as result it generates talent gap for early stage companies although these companies ned digital talent to help them advance digitaly their lack of progres restricts their ability to atract that talent kane et al analysis of the degre of maturity of the digital transformation of an organization figure digital transformation maturity levels source own elaboration adapted from kane et al digitaly maturing organizations provide the resources and oportunities so your employes thrive in digital environment by developing employes for the suces in digital environments busines leaders are placing more emphasis on skils of change than in technological knowledge kane et al digitaly maturing companies also value leadership knowledge technology is not the most important skil that leaders must have the ability to leading company through busines model change is the most important and being forward thinking progresive is almost as important with clear vision solid strategy and foresight acording to kane et al structure of the maturity model questionaire digital transformation the maturity model quiz aligning the organization for its digital future by kane et al in english contains questions regarding digital transformation and questions on demographics and characterization of the organization which are designed to obtain trends by industrial sectors chapter in the mtd characterization shet in anex table there is information aditional information on the maturity model adjustment of the maturity model digital transformation aligning the organization for its digital future the questionaire described in section was adjusted in spanish language latin american and the same content questions were maintained but they reduced the demographic clasification and characterization questions to because those that aim to outline the comparison betwen types of companies and sectors likewise the terms of company by entity were changed industry by sector partners by alies busines models by busines models betwen others and the people dimension to human talent to sek more clarity and understanding for the population to be surveyed se figure figure seting the selected mtd questionaire survey source self made table in anex presents

the organization internal document analysis of the degre of maturity of the digital transformation of an organization in this outline of the organization under study the fact that stands out within the information technology management proces map is not yet found and comunications as it is in the construction stage se figure this is conflictive because the proces is not considered within the management system of the entity results of the aplication of the model digital transformation maturity the level of maturity of the digital transformation achieved by the organization targeted study is segregated with one of the respondents placing him in early five in development and six in maturing however those who consider their entity as an organization that matures digitaly they granted it the lowest score of this level that is the entity for them is just begining its maturation stage which places the organization more towards maturity of the digital transformation in development figure maturity level of digital transformation in the organization under study source self made the positioning of the organization under study in the third level of maturity of the digital transformation is suported by the remaining results achieved in the aplication of the instrument that are specified by dimension of the mtd and that are definedchapter in subsequent sections remember that participation was only obtained of of the target population which gives an idea of the phenomenon but as it is obviously it does not represent the entire organization and is not generalizable to al companies in the sector of this type results curent status of the strategy dimension nine of those surveyed consider that their digital strategy entity is relatively clear and coherent and thre of the respondents did not they have knowledge about the clarity and coherence of the digital strategy respondents do not consider or do not know that the folowing objectives make part of your entity digital strategy this way improve the experience and citizen comitment two people increase eficiency one person increase inovation two people improve decision making decisions person fundamentaly transform the proceses and or the busines model of the entity one person seven people from the oficials in charge of supervising managing the digital strategy are found at the hierarchical level only two of those surveyed consider that the leadership of the entity has suficient knowledge and capacity to lead the digital strategy only one of the respondents totaly disagres in considering that the employes have suficient knowledge and ability to execute the strategy digital of our organization thre of the participants consider that the projection period for the execution of the digital strategy in the organization must be les than or equal to two years and eight respondents think it should be betwen to years only thre of those surveyed consider that the digital strategy is part integral to the general strategy of your entity results curent status of the tasks dimension four of those surveyed do not consider that digital technologies wil change or they wil be disruptive for their sector to large extent analysis of the degre of maturity of the digital transformation of an organization the total number of respondents do not consider that their entity prepares apropriately for the disruptions expected to ocur in your sector due to digital trends among the bariers that prevent the entity from taking advantage of digital trends are you have to eight people think there are to many priorities in competence person considers it to be lack of understanding of management person considers it to be lack of organizational agility person believes there are to many digital trends trend has not landed when more and new trends are already emerging the most important specific technologies for the entity this year are agrement with thre people for analytics four people for cloud one person for social one person the internet of things iot thre people security one person the educational content the most important specific technologies for the entity in the next to years acording to six people analytics one person cloud two people security two people cognitive technologies ai and one person educational content two of the respondents consider that the demand for products or services of your entity increase or decrease due to digital trends in the next years wil remain the same eleven of those surveyed consider that it is very likely that their entity develop new core busines lines in the next to years in response to digital trends ten of the enc ustates agre that their entity has established more and or strong relationships with external alies as result of trends digital seven of the oficials surveyed consider that the work style of their entity is closer to the colaborative type and two of the oficials surveyed consider that the work style of their entity is closer to the type independent siloed chapter results curent status of the culture dimension thre of the respondents agre that their risk apetite desire organization is characterized more as daring exploratory and thre others do so considered as cautious risk averse only thre of the oficials surveyed agre that their organization is characterized as agile quick to act two of the oficials surveyed think that their organization pasion for work is working to live ten of the oficials surveyed agre that the your organization digital capabilities diferentiate you from other busines entities public character ten of those surveyed agre that their entity implements actively initiatives to change their culture to be more colaborative responsive risk fre and agile in response to digital trends results curent status of the human talent dimension only one of the respondents strongly agres that his organization gives you the resources or oportunities to develop skils to thrive in digital environment ten of those surveyed expect their organization to help them develop skils to thrive in digital environment eleven of those surveyed consider that it is important to work for organization that is digitaly enabled or is digital leader given digital trends survey participants want to work in your organization for les than year acording to one person to years acording to two people to years acording to two people to years acording to one person more than years acording to two people and four people do not know only eight of the oficials surveyed agre that their organization neds significantly new or diferent talent pol to compete efectively in the digital economy analysis of the degre of maturity of the digital transformation of an organization only one of the oficials surveyed is very sure of being able to develop the skils to thrive in more digital work environment ten of those surveyed agre that the adoption of digital by part of its entity atracts new talents results curent status of the structure dimension seven of the respondents characterize the leadership structure of their organization as hierarchical only seven of those surveyed would characterize their decision making data driven organization and four of respondents would characterize the taking your organization decision making proces betwen data driven and instinctive only six of those surveyed consider that their entity is at closer to being an ideal organization transformed by technologies and digital capabilities that improve proceses involve talent throughout the organization and promote new and value generating busines models and thre of the participants consider that their entity is at maximum of of maturity in digital transformation ten of the oficials surveyed think that their entity invests in inovation capabilities to create new products and services through digital technology ten of those surveyed consider that their entity mainly strengthens the digital inovation capabilities by developing the digital capabilities of existing employes and consultants only eight of those surveyed strongly agre that the image of your entity improves due to your digital initiatives and four of the respondents neither agre nor disagre with this chapter sumary as observed throughout the construction of chapter it is posible to aply the method or digital transformation maturity measurement model most apropriate to the organization through the adaptation and development of the maturity model of chapter digital transformation mtd selected aligning the organization for its digital future by kane et al and their final adjusted questionaire or the survey digital busines executives aligning the organization for its digital future the which consists of questions in total adapted from the original mtd questionaire selected acording to compliance with the organization under study in table anex contains the questions from the original questionaire and the changes made and it was answered by of the entity sumoned oficials the tabulation of the results is contained in anex in figure for each ask based on these results the analysis wil be executed to design recomendations for improvement and achievement of your goal in the transformation proces digital and it was defined that the level of maturity of the digital transformation of the organization object of study is under development it is remarkable to say that the questions acording to the dimension of the chosen mtd strategy tasks culture human talent and structure so that the analysis can be caried out in simpler and corect recomendations for improvement the maturity level of digital transformation of organization under study this chapter aims to propose recomendations to the organization to improve your level of digital transformation maturity based on the results of the aplication derived from this the chapter is composed of section that establishes the method folowed for the construction of the chapter section ideal state in transformation digital that was defined based on documentary analysis and interviews with the representative in td of the organization gap analysis where the improvement oportunities to reach level of digital transformation maturity high and in acordance with the organization digital strategy and recomendations by mtd dimensions designed based on the gaps found in the comparison of the curent state asis and desired state tobe of the organization in digital transformation for each dimension of the mtd method to design the recomendations and give the model the functionality of being prescriptive which was discused in section was based on the architecture of the two axis roadmap of gipuzkoa beritzen inobasque which the vertical axis reflects aspects or perspectives that are going to be analyzed and the horizontal axis determines the horizon sections that wil be considered in the reflection the sections standard are thre short medium and long term se figure chapter figure guidelines for roadmaping based on the mtd dimensions source own elaboration based on gipuzkoa beritzen inobasque with this roadmaping technique comon vision of the strategy shared by diferent stakeholders to reach the ideal state desired and develop perspective on each layer of the roadmap vertical axis focusing on the thre basic questions that we want to answer se figure the final roadmap wil reflect the path to folow from where you are today state curent or asis for its acronym in english to the long term future vision that is sought build ideal state or tobe for its acronym in english where the milestones that are they intend to achieve in each of the perspectives in horizon divided into stretches diferent in this way the design of recomendations was generated in thre stages it was established curent state of the organization in digital transformation or asis td based on the information obtained with the aplication of the

initiatives that should be put in place to eliminate the diference betwen these two states acording to the results obtained from the gap analysis se figure this gap analysis is caried out initialy for each question in the questionaire and then consolidated for each of the dimensions the mtd figure method for defining chapter source self made curent status in digital transformation by dimensions of the maturity model digital transformation the curent status of the organization in digital transformation or asis td was obtained for each dimension based on the results of the aplication of the selected mtd each one of these asis td are found in chapter in section for the dimension strategy in section for the tasks dimension in section for the culture dimension in section for the human talent dimension and in the section for the structure dimension chapter ideal state in digital transformation by dimensions of the maturity model digital transformation ideal state in digital transformation for the dimension strategy the organization wishes in acordance with strategic planing regarding digital transformation that of its colaborators and oficials know their digital strategy and take ownership of it by recognizing that through compliance from this the entity wil be able to achieve beter standards of quality inovation agility adaptability and efectivenes in its management as wel as the objectives established for fulfil it and in the strategic plan for information and comunications technologies petic defines its integration with the entity general strategy guided by the guidelines of the digital government policy that proposes model that consists of two components ict for the state and ict for society thre enablers transversal it architecture security and privacy digital citizen services to achieve the five purposes described above likewise the entity it strategic objective is to strengthen the management of information and comunications technologies ict which alows the adoption of standards and guidelines of busines architecture for inclusive development sustained participatory and transparent at each of the thre organizational levels to comunicate supervise and manage the digital strategy transversaly in the entity based on the importance of each activity caried out the other objective in this line is to enable the technology capabilities and services necesary to drive busines transformations for quality education and acording to the selected mtd companies that mature digitaly link their digital strategy with the general strategy and also have longer term vision of the strategy analysis of the degre of maturity of the digital transformation of an organization ideal state in digital transformation for the dimension tasks the entity petic is aimed at integrating and suporting the execution of the sector plan of the entity guide and acompany the entity senior management in programing of investments in technology information and comunications ologies direct actions of technology in acordance with the general strategy of the entity and its projects define the policies standards methodologies guidelines and recomendations that wil alow greater use of resources efective use of emerging technologies and use of tols alow the entity to establish neds in ict subject with this the project portfolio wil be updated acording to the neds and strategies proposed for the coming years evaluate how it is used the technology that the entity curently has and take advantage of the best practices of the diferent areas to achieve unified aproach and recognize savings oportunities and consolidation of efort the organization wishes acording to the investment projects and its goal as state entity make new social contract with equal oportunities for social inclusion productive and political inovate and modernize the technological platform for the improvement of educational quality by recognizing digital technologies as entities of change for your sector the entity considers information and comunications technologies ict as an important tol to contribute to the improvement of education its impact on the student learning is conditioned on the one hand to its use by the teachers in their teaching practices and on the other at the level of pedagogical apropriation that they have of ict therefore designing models and strategies that take advantage of the advantages of ict in the use and apropriation of ict by the educational comunity it becomes priority aspect for the entity acording to its petic likewise some of the ict guiding principles for the entity alignment with the strategy the entity busines strategy must always be the basis for interpreting curent and future neds to be resolved by ict solutions in this way the initiatives must suport the objectives strategic chapter justified acquisition it acquisitions are made for valid reasons based on apropriate and continuous analysis with clear and transparent there is an apropriate balance betwen benefits oportunities costs and risks both short and long term ict as strategic aset ict in the organization is welcomed as strategic asets and therefore those in charge of the it function must have the actors and organizational structure that are involved in the understanding of the neds and gaps at the central local and institutional by participating from the formulation of initiatives and their definition conceptual and logical and not only from the reception of requirements integrated information systems the articulation of information systems of the organization has platform integrated information which suports misionary and suport proceses for decision making strategic tactical and operational on the other hand in line with the mtd organizations that mature digitaly have more agile and adaptive operating perspective through workforces contingents personalized work adoption of digital trends organized work by modules where apropriate building stronger relationships with partners and organizing work around projects rather than functional silos ideal state in digital transformation for the dimension culture the organization wants to promote the educational ofer in the city to guarante aces and the permanence of boys girls and young people in the educational system in its diferent forms levels and modalities the quality and relevance of education with the purpose to form individuals capable of living productively creatively and responsibly in comunity one of the guiding principles of ict for the organization is justified acquisition which states that it acquisitions are made for valid reasons based on apropriate and continuous analysis with clear and transparent decisions there is balance apropriate betwen benefits oportunities costs and risks both in the short and long term term analysis of the degre of maturity of the digital transformation of an organization in the entity potential solutions were identified in alignment with the data architectures aplications and technology to consolidate the projects for the petic portfolio of the institution under the previous context for the purposes of the petic in isue the project portfolio is one of the most important results since this contains the high level conceptualization of the programs and projects whose execution and management wil materialize the petic to achieve its objective the entity integrated planing and management model mipg sets the folowing objectives strengthen leadership and human talent under the principles of integrity and legality as an engine for generating results of public administration streamline simplify and make the operation for the generation of gods and services more flexible services that efectively resolve the neds of citizens develop solid organizational culture based on information control evaluation for decision making and continuous improvement the public policy of the online government strategy in colombia that began in with presidential directive of that year and continued decisively with the isuance of decre that defined the general guidelines of the strategy online government has evolved permanently in the country both in its scope towards greater number of entities as wel as in its implementation by them because more and more information technologies and comunications have ben become tol par excelence to improve public management and state citizen relationship and under this guideline the entity acts in this dimension for the mtd organizations that mature digitaly value experimentation and sped acept risk and create leadership structures distributed aditionaly they encourage colaboration and are more likely to use data in the decision making ideal state in digital transformation for the dimension human talent the entity strategic it objective is to strengthen the management of it technologies information and comunications ict which alows the adoption of standards and busines architecture guidelines for inclusive sustained development chapter participatory and transparent at each of the thre organizational levels to supervise and manage the digital strategy transversaly in the entity based on the importance of each activity developed the other objective in this line is to enable the technology capabilities and services neded to drive transformations for quality education another objective set by the entity in its mipg is strengthen leadership and talent human under the principles of integrity and legality as the engine of the generation of public administration results and acording to the mtd the development of human talent is an important element of the culture in entities that mature digitaly with special interest in potentiating existing talent and recruit new talent the later based on their use of digital digitaly maturing entities provide the oportunities and resources so that your colaborators thrive in digital environment by developing employes for suces in digital environments emphasize change skils beyond the technological knowledge ideal state in digital transformation for the dimension structure the organization under study conceives as fundamental pilar for the chalenges that the petic proposes to have the apropriate organization which is made up of structure organization chart its functions and clearly defined proceses the map of the entity proceses alows graphicaly identifying the way in which the proceses of the entity acording to their nature as wel as the interelation betwen the themselves to obtain results to achieve its purpose the entity integrated planing and management model mipg sets the folowing objectives strengthen leadership and human talent under the principles of integrity and legality as an engine for generating results of public administration streamline simplify and make the operation for the generation of gods and services more flexible services that efectively resolve the neds of citizens analysis of the degre of maturity of the digital transformation of an organization develop solid organizational culture based on information control evaluation for decision making and continuous improvement and among its guiding principles of ict ict is conceived as strategic aset ict in the entity are considered strategic asets and therefore those in charge of the it function must have the actors and organizational structure that are involve in the very understanding of the neds and gaps at the central levels local and institutional by participating from the formulation of initiatives and their definition conceptual and logical and not only from the reception of requirements likewise for the mtd organizations that mature digitaly also value leadership the ability to lead company through busines model change is the most important skil folowed by data driven decision making these digitaly maturing entities invest in inovation capabilities to create new products and services through digital technology with style of distributed leadership in which decision making is quick agile and responsive adaptive without concentrating power in few analysis of gaps by dimensions of the digital transformation maturity model gap analysis for the strategy dimension acording to the results obtained in chapter section curent status for the strategy dimension and compared to the ideal state of the present dimension in section shows deficiency in the design of the company digital strategy entity translated into lack of clarity and coherence for its oficials this is not is explicitly defined in the strategic plan for information technologies and comunications petic defined by the redp administrative ofice only reference is made to this in section and although in section of the the document in question establishes that the entity is guided by the guidelines of the digital government policy defined by the mintic there is no adoption of it at the particularities of the organization by not having digital strategy in this way oficials colaborators do not fuly take ownership of the strategy digital of the entity and do not know how they can help it comply how it is develops and what are the benefits it brings to your organization chapter in section definition of the strategic it objectives within the strategic plan of information and comunications technologies defines the objectives for which which the knowledge of oficials in this question is evaluated however observes that the later do not have solid knowledge and apropriation of the same evidenced by the high percentages obtained in the responses agre nor agrement nor disagre disagre and totaly disagre seven of the oficials in charge of supervising managing the digital strategy are they are at the highest hierarchical level of the entity which is god when recognize the digital strategy as the main driver of inovation efectivenes and quality of the organization however this is not caried to midle management and the level operational that is there is strategic planing but it is not executed in maner transversal in the entity this is also evident in decre of july in article of functions does not talk about digital transformation ten of those surveyed consider not in their entirety or at al the directives of the entity has suficient knowledge and capacity to lead the digital strategy which manifests deficiency in the way the strategy is implemented and controled digital of the entity likewise the entity leadership is perceived as weak for this management which is suported by decre of july in article of functions there is no talk of digital transformation and therefore the profesional profiles do not take into acount acount for the skils and knowledge related to this area eleven of those surveyed consider not entirely or not at al that the oficials have suficient knowledge and capacity to execute the digital strategy of the entity this shows deficiency in the skils and knowledge of the oficials to implement the digital strategy which is suported by the decre of july article of functions does not talk about transformation digital and therefore profesional profiles do not take into acount the skils and related knowledge in this area eight of the entity oficials think that to develop the digital strategy you must project future of more than two years asociated with public planing isues that are linked to the period of the government plan which is years in this way the strategy digital is defined in the medium term but in changes of government no continuity is observed management that enhances the benefits obtained in the previous period analysis of the degre of maturity of the digital transformation of an organization only thre of those surveyed believe that the digital strategy is an integral part of the general strategy of your entity this due to ignorance of these or lack of clarity and coherence of the digital strategy evidenced in question one in the plan strategic information and comunications technologies petic does not se the harmonization betwen the digital strategy and the general strategy of the entity because the first is not clearly defined in this document and harmonization is caried out superfluously gap analysis for the tasks dimension in light of the results obtained in section curent state of the dimension tasks and compared to the ideal state of the dimension in section we have that only four of the oficials surveyed believe that technologies digital technologies wil change or be disruptive to their sector to smal or medium extent which which is worying from the perspective that the organization manages where it recognizes these technologies as fundamental for the provision of beter service and the improvement of social conditions of the sector where its management is caried out because these do not they share the perception of the organization latent risk for the entity is evident since al of the respondents considers that adequate preparation of your entity for the disruptions that are expected that ocur in your sector due to digital trends are incomplete or does not ocur or in the worst case they do not have knowledge of the situation to take position on it an oportunity for improvement is evident for the entity as it does not have the ability to define strategic and operational priorities as answered by eight of the surveyed oficials this is one of the bigest risks company faces management by not focusing on achievable goals and the eficient use of its resources by covering more than what management capacity alows and even more in digital transformation this section gives the entity the option to integrate into its strategic planing digital specific technologies for the establishment of efective management enterprise architecture and services acording to the neds and expectations of your sector as complement the petic deals with architecture of information systems information and architecture of conectivity services that can be enrichedchapter for the present results likewise busines architecture in general establishing it from the technological trends important to the entity on the other hand it must be clarified that in this dimension there was an option to place aditional technology to those stated other which is why educational content apears this is evidently not technology which reveals knowledge confused about what technology is and what can be done with it on the part of some oficials of the entity nine of the oficials surveyed believe that the demand for the products or services of your entity increase or decrease due to digital trends in the next years which determines the importance perceived from within to launch digital transformation proces that promotes inovation efectivenes improving the internal and external customer experience decision making asertivenes and busines model that can adapt to disruptions in the sector eleven of the oficials surveyed believe that it is very likely that their entity develop new core busines lines over the next years in response to digital trends which is not reflected in the petic by not defining any type of value proposition in this field that is from strategic planing digital organization this plus is not given for the evolution of the busines model of this ten of the oficials surveyed agre that the entity has established more solid relationships with external alies as result of digital trends however these are not evident in the petic nor are the strategies and policies to achieve them seven of the oficials surveyed believe that their entity work style is closer to the colaborative type because the management of the entity is proposed through proceses that develop management in transversal way but on the other hand in certain activities the hierarchical functioning established in the organizational chart where it is obtained that thre of the oficials surveyed agre with that the entity work style is intermediate betwen independent and colaborative it is also observed that the entity has two proces maps one in its petic diferent from the one published on its website this generated because the petic is not updated and does not receive the necesary folow up another oportunity for improvement analysis of the degre of maturity of the digital transformation of an organization along these lines is that the proces map published on the entity website which it is taken as reference for this final master thesis it does not contain the proces of information and comunications technology management and leaves out of the busines perspective of the entity digital transformation however in the numeral of the petic where the other proces map of the entity is presented there is proces technology ict and then in section the management proces is introduced information and comunications technologies which shows how disjointed is the documentation and therefore the management of the entity by not have coherence and clarity in its institutional guidelines now the entity develops project management based on standards international it standards such as togaf iso cobit but presents oportunities for improvement in resource optimization response agility and adaptability to change this as result of the documentary analysis of the management reports of the ofice of information and comunications technologies for the month of september and april in which non executions of scheduled activities and delays within the projects due to not having an agile governance structure in the entity and at the design level of the entity busines architecture there is way long they must travel because they are curently under construction of the work for its construction acording to the information provided by the representative in td of the organization and the document plantrabajoarquitectura gap analysis for the culture dimension acording to the results obtained in section curent state of the culture dimension and in paralel with the ideal state of the dimension in section it is observed that six of respondents believe that their organization risk apetite desire is characterized intermediate betwen daring exploratory and cautious risk averse evidenced on the principle of justified acquisition aditionaly due to the public nature of the entity it tends to be more cautious in the management of spending and its resources nine of the oficials surveyed consider that to medium or moderate extent overal its organization is characterized by being slow deliberative which means that the decision making is late and planing is non adaptive this shows the use of traditional project management methodologies which are based on strong planing throughout development and longer life cyclechapter traditional as wel as an organizational culture that is not focused on obtaining results ten of the oficials surveyed think that their organization pasion for work is living to work that is they find pasion in what they do however it would be necesary to analyze whether oficials have equity betwen their profesional and personal lives since they do not consider work as means but as an end nine of the respondents strongly agre or agre that the digital capabilities of your organization diferentiate them from other entities of nature public being leading entity and reference in the sector they are at the head of the digital transformation proces of its population of interest however other organizations have presented inovations that can be replicated in this also it is presented as latent risk that thre of the respondents do not have the suficient knowledge or criteria to take position on the premise nine of those surveyed believe fuly or partialy that their entity implements actively initiatives to change their culture to be more colaborative responsive to risk and agile in response to digital trends reflected in projects and programs that are in force although these initiatives must be clearer and more coherent for al oficials here the result is to highlight the level of participation of the respondents with exclusively the response of oficials of the to whom the survey and the extension that was given by extending the closing time of the survey due to not having suficient number of shares which leads to afi sign that although the entity is in proces of digital transformation in development it is perceived as if it were exclusively the interest and comitment of the information technology ofice information and comunications and not responsibility of the entire organization which it is also reinforced by what was reported by the td representative of the organization in regarding problems presented in the execution of ict projects gap analysis for the human talent dimension based on the results obtained in chapter section curent status for the human talent dimension and in comparison with the ideal state of the present dimension in section it is evident that eight of the oficials surveyed did not analysis of the degre of maturity of the digital transformation of an organization they are completely sure that their organization provides them with the resources or oportunities to develop skils to thrive in digital environment and even more worying is that thre people in this group do not have the tols and knowledge necesary to expres position on the same premise as sen in the ideal state or tobe the entity sets objectives to achieve however these are not are fuly articulated with the human talent development area of the entity as digital transformation is considered problem specific to the area of the ofice of information and comunications technologies nine of those surveyed agre completely or partialy that they expect their organization to help them develop skils to thrive in digital environment at this point an oportunity for improvement is evident for the entity in incorporate the digital transformation proces into your human talent area to develop competencies and skils in its oficials that alow the management of the itself and the achievement of the digital strategy and objectives in adition to their oficials present provision for this based on their responses eleven of the oficials who caried out the survey believe that it is very important to work for an organization that is digitaly enabled or is digital leader indicating the recognition of these towards digital transformation as key to suces organizational and highlights strength of the entity by having colaborators interested and wiling to adopt and use technology for the evolution of their proces of management and that of your organization five of the oficials surveyed want to work in their entity given the trends digital from to more than years which goes hand in hand with the results obtained in questions and in which the pasion for the work done is evident the perception of the value they have for their entity to the extent that they provide them with the tols to thrive and expectations for growth in training but something what is striking is the uncertainty of four of the respondents who do not know why how long do they want to work at the entity given digital trends this can be related to the results obtained in questions and in which they have doubts about whether your entity leadership has suficient knowledge and capacity to lead the organization digital strategy and whether the digital capabilities of your organization diferentiate them from other public entities chapter eight of those surveyed believe that their organization neds talent pol significantly new or diferent to compete efectively in the economy digital which is linked to the results of the previous response where oficials they may consider that their permanence in the entity wil be linked to their skils and capabilities that alow them to be sucesful in digital environment aditionaly it is it should be noted that four of the respondents do not take position on the stated ned in the statement which generates concern on the folowing points knowledge deficient of the subject the fear of being obsolete in digital medium or the indiference towards the sucesful development of your entity eight of those surveyed are sure or very sure that they can develop the skils to thrive in more digital work environment which is positive for the entity without however in the profesional profiles these knowledge and skils must be included as requirements for them on the other hand two respondents are concerned about not being able to develop the skils to thrive in an environment of more digital work in this case there is an oportunity for improvement when designing and implement training and education plan for human talent where there is take into acount the entity digital strategy nine of the oficials surveyed agre or totaly agre with which the adoption of digital by your entity atracts new talents which reafirms the ned to include knowledge and skils related to transformation digital within the profesional profiles of oficials as wel as in the training and education plans thre respondents who neither agre nor disagrement are in agrement with the four who gave the same answer in the question gap analysis for the structure dimension acording to the results obtained in chapter in section curent state of the structure dimension and in balance with the ideal state of this dimension in the section it is observed that seven of the respondents characterize the leadership structure of its organization as hierarchical and that presents the folowing oportunities for improvement technology and data must be considered strategic factor for the entity that generates value it management in the entity ad requires comprehensive cordination betwen the operational strategic and misional areas that give results the information must be analysis of the degre of maturity of the digital transformation of an organization timely reliable available and be at the service of users in acordance with the transparency and integrity criteria there is ned to socialize and implement guidelines for interoperability betwen information systems internal and external of

department responsible for it decisions from the strategic planing of the entity and definition of an organizational chart of those responsible of the it function that alows beter management of ict in the entity seven of those surveyed define their organization decision making as based in data and that has the folowing oportunities for improvement technology and data they must be considered strategic factor for the entity that generates value management it in the entity requires comprehensive cordination betwen operational areas strategic and misional that gives results the information must be timely reliable available and be at the service of users in acordance with transparency criteria and integrity thereof robust characterization for it management proceses which centralize roles

delivered by third parties have resources and formal chanels to inform about the it strategy it is pertinent to review internal and external comunications initiatives in the entity six of those surveyed consider that their entity is closer of being an ideal organization transformed by digital technologies and capabilities that they improve proceses involve talent throughout the organization and promote busines models new and value generating busineses or if the rating is weighted the entity is located on scale which does not position the entity very wel leaving it with long way to go this was confirmed in the analysis of the previous questions and in the recomendations generated leading to level of transformation maturity digital in development ten of the oficials surveyed think that their entity is investing in inovation capabilities to create new products and services through digital technology evidenced in the projects launched by the entity althoughchapter oportunities present themselves improvement it service solutions must be aligned with the proceses established in the entity proces map for beter use of the oportunities for the use of ict acording to the cost benefit strengthen the human team of the entity for the development of the ict use and apropriation capabilities for al the entity stakeholders ned for knowledge transfer protocols and repository that demonstrates al results of each it project delivered by third parties have resources and formal chanels to inform about the it strategy it is pertinent to review the internal and external comunications initiatives in the organization update permanent catalog of the entity information systems which includes its solution architecture definition of the internal model parameters and guidelines for the software development for the entity and implement solutions that use technologies in the cloud when aplicable and that respond to performance scalability and security of the information ten of those surveyed consider that their entity mainly strengthens the digital inovation capabilities by developing employes digital capabilities existing contractors and consultants which presents latent risk in the development of external relationships mergers and acquisitions when pigeonholed as an entity public that has no competition these are oportunities that are not explored by the organization eight of the oficials surveyed totaly agre or agre that your entity image is improving due to your digital initiatives however four of the respondents do not take sides on this statement which presents oportunities for improvement for the entity since they do not recognize the benefits and importance of digital transformation within your entity recomendations by dimensions of the digital transformation maturity model recomendations in the strategy dimension acording to the results of section the folowing are proposed recomendations analysis of the degre of

maturity based on the results of the aplication by runing gap analysis betwen the curent state and ideal of the organization under study these oportunities and improvement initiatives are aimed at ensuring that the level of maturity of the digital transformation of the entity improves and can go from developing maturing by atacking the critical points in each dimension of analysis of the mtd chapter among the recomendations the one that stands out the most is the design of digital strategy acording to the strategic planing of the organization under study and its subsequent socialization to ensure its apropriation by al colaborators of the entity although in the strategic plan for information and comunications technologies petic of the entity refers to it it does not define it as second key recomendation presents the design implementation and maintenance of busines architecture and in third position emphasis is placed on monitoring and update and alignment with decre of dafp conpes dnp and decre of mintic of the organization petic since based on this the organization digital transformation vision moves and they derive their guidelines regarding digital strategy conclusions the objective of this final master thesis was to analyze the degre of maturity of the digital transformation of an organization which was achieved by characterizing the methods models for measuring the maturity of digital transformation based on review of systematic literature that gave way to the description of maturity models for after the execution of the selection proces define an ideal mtd to aply in the organization under study as result of this selection the maturity model was chosen aligning the organization for its digital future by kane et al this mtd was adapted to latin american spanish and adjusted in terms of terminology and number of demographic clasification and characterization questions which resulted in survey with total of questions that received the name survey to digital busines executives aligning the organization for its digital future by aplying the method or model for measuring the maturity of the digital transformation more suitable for the organization with participation of of the target population and places to the organization at level of maturity of the digital transformation in development finding itself in the transition from traditional organizational structure to one that acepts more risk encourages colaboration is more likely to use data in decision making decisions works to closely link its digital strategies with the strategy general of his company with long term vision he strives to develop talent existing and recruit new talent based on their use of digital has begun to provide the resources and oportunities for your employes to thrive in digital environment and its institutional leaders begin to pay atention to the change skils despite this even the entity under study must make eforts to corect the existing gaps to be an ideal organization transformed by technologies and digital capabilities that improve proceses atract talent throughout the organization and promote new busines models that generate value what led to propósito analysis of the degre of maturity of the digital transformation of an organization recomendations to the organization to improve its level of transformation maturity digital based on aplication results based on curent state analysis and the ideal state for each dimension of the mtd the gap analysis the documentary analysis and the interviews caried out with the representative in td of the organization are tols used to complement the colection of information obtained from the aplication of the mtd give the model the functionality of being prescriptive and generate roadmap that helps the organization under study to improve your degre of progres in digital transformation aditionaly it was proposed improvement for the mtd in which the questions of its questionaire were grouped acording to the dimensions it proposes to facilitate the analysis of results and generation of recomendations among the key recomendations the definition of an apropriate digital strategy stands out to the strategic planing of the organization under study and its subsequent socialization to ensure its apropriation by al colaborators of the entity the design implementation and maintenance of an enterprise architecture and the monitoring and updating of the organization petic since based on this moves the organization digital transformation vision and its guidelines are derived in terms of digital strategy it is very necesary that the organization where the selected mtd was aplied conceives its digital transformation proces as an extension of your strategic planing aligned with the digital government policy through decre of mintic national development plan colombia world power of life dnp as observed in the gap analysis the lack in the rom ility and knowledge of its oficials to implement the digital strategy this exposed to risks that management faces by not focusing on achievable goals and the eficient use of its resources by covering more than what alows achieving the management capacity and even more so in digital transformation the organization also has late decision making and its planing is is not adaptive which slows down your digital transformation proces by not considering the technology and data as strategic factor for the entity that generates value in the lack of comprehensive cordination betwen operational strategic and misional areas that gives results in it management and where finaly the information is not beingconclusions timely reliable available and is not at al times at the service of the users in acordance with its transparency and integrity criteria however as great strength of the entity the interest of its talent is presented human being to learn new knowledge and acquire new skils that enable them be efective in your digital environment for the improvement of your organization on the other hand it is concluded that preparing for digital future is not an easy task means develop digital capabilities in which activities people culture and structure of company are synchronized and aligned with set of objectives organizational however most companies are limited by the lack of resources lack of talent and the pul of other priorities leaving executives in charge of managing digital initiatives that take the form of projects or are limited to activities within given division function or activity or chanel in world increasingly digital digital transformation is not just about implementing more and beter technologies implies digital congruence aligning culture people structure and tasks of the organization the scope of the proposed objectives was achieved by executing the descriptive study established since it was aimed at measuring the presence characteristics or distribution of the maturity of the digital transformation in the organization under study limiting to describe one or several phenomena without the intention of establishing causal relationships with other factors and without intentional manipulation only the phenomena were observed as they were as they ocured in their natural context with the combination of quantitative techniques and qualitative tests to obtain the required information which ofered an idea of the level of maturity of digital transformation but as is evident it is not generalizable to al entities in the sector and does not generalize the situation of the organization object of study likewise the mtd aligning the organization for its digital future by kane et al provides comprehensive overview how digital transformation ocurs within company from its strategy culture human talent structure and tasks as wel as the posibility of delimiting its objective state by defining what the conditions are of company in digital maturation analysis of the degre of maturity of the digital transformation of an organization limitations in the development of this degre work there was limitation regarding aces to the implemented methods of various digital transformation maturity models mtd to measure the maturity of organizations in terms of digital transformation although maturity measurement models were obtained in the rsl very few presented complete information for implementation only of mtd had this information aditionaly the maturity model of selected digital transformation was only aplied to one organization due to that aces to these is restricted and we worked with non probabilistic sample for convenience of single case regarding the aplication within the organization under study it was also stated lack of interest on the part of your colaborators towards the oportunity to improve their degre of suces in digital transformation having reduced participation of which does not provide the posibility of having more complete picture of what is hapening realy within the organization as wel as very long periods of time for respond to information requirements on average to months to provide solution to requirements necesary for the continuation of the study on the other hand the target population was not very familiar with administrative terminology regarding the busines model stigmatizing the concepts of busines competition customer productivity and performance only to those private companies of nature comercial for profit and competition furthermore they have the paradigm of being unique public entity of its kind in the region that does not have comparative reference that makes them take advantage of oportunities for improvement with the exception of the regulations that they must comply by law the later is clear evidence that confirms the reason for the low level of participation in this exercise contributions to the field of aplication as contribution to the field of aplication it is expected that organizations acquire structured and robust understanding of digital transformation and busines models digital transformation maturity by designing and implementing this proces based on their particular neds and aspirations conceived from holistic and continuity of the entire entity and its organizational philosophy to change in this way the conclusions misconception about digital transformation as being simple acquisition of new technology likewise it is expected that the methodology described here for selection and aplication of mtd provides tols and suport to organizations starting or are imersed in the adventure of digital transformation contributions to industrial enginering as contribution to industrial enginering we wish to deliver reference study for the measurement of the level of maturity of digital transformation in which its methodology can be replicable and its results are taken as comparative basis for other analyses jointly it seks to deliver broad and strongly constituted state of the art that alows higher level of apropriation and transfer of knowledge in transformation digital it is worth highlighting that the characterization here achieved for total of mtd from the year to has no precedents in the literature therefore it is an instrument very useful in understanding and generating new knowledge in transformation digital likewise the expansion of the mtd methodology is contribution selected with the adition of gap analysis that provides the necesary roadmap to increase the degre of maturity of the organization digital transformation as wel as such as the modification that was made to the mtd aligning colection tol the organization for its digital future by kane et al by grouping their questions acording to the dimensions it defines which facilitate the study of its results and proposed recomendations future jobs and posible lines of investigation among the posible future works and posible lines of research

the model it uses strategies to optimize its operation with the same resources generaly their strategies are geographic expansion and growth of the customer base renewal model seks to revitalize its products platforms and operations either by creating new products or services or developing new capabilities and atacking new markets an extension model seks to expand industries to monopolize new unexplored market segments functions and operations existing product lines are not changed but rather they ad new ones which means the busines model generaly becomes broader trajectory model means new busines model this drastic change is response to drastic change in the environment these changes are crucial for the survival of company over time busines models on the web busines model is method of

integrate internal and external elements of company in order to obtain economicaly favorable results the functions of busines model are to articulate the value proposition identify market segments define the value chain structure estimate the cost structure and revenue potential describe its position in value network and formulate the competitive strategy the proces to design busines model consists of defining value proposition that solves problem with defined product the way the customer would use it and how big that is problem for the client the market segment depends on the problem that the value proposition solves and they are the ones that are wiling to pay to solve that problem the value chain is extremely important because or is it enough to create value but with creating value to such point that the company manages to obtain profit margin and thus guarante its survival after having defined the previous points an income architecture must be designed which is the blueprint to folow for the flow of money in the company company that is defining how the client wil pay how the supliers wil be paid and thus having defined structure for guarante profitability finaly competitive strategy is that diferent and dificult to replicate factor that makes company more sucesful than another case study nubank fintech are companies that base their services on financial technology new technologies such as blockchain alow each more and more people trust fintech to manage something as sensitive as money with the pasage of time and the rise of technology several busines

busineses to adapt or die it is increasingly comon for traditional banks to create strategies with high technological component to maintain their clients and prevent them from migrating to fintech alternatives it is also worth highlighting that fintech they enter the market with atractive conditions for the client as in the case of nubank and fc which do not charge comisions to the client for managing their money contrary to what hapens with traditional banks another phenomenon to take into acount the main thing is that fintech makes products more acesible to al sectors of the population reducing the bariers to entry requested by traditional bank and simplifying procedures thus increasing the rate of banking of the population fc despite entering the busines recently already has recognition and large user base seks become digital bank and for this it is launching pr oducts once year future work is then the consulting proces for the development of your next product which wil be virtual walet the end the last of this is for this virtual walet to function as savings acount and thus begin to ofer the products ofered by bank finaly we can conclude that new busines models emerge from existing models in the present the new busines models that emerge have high technological component and even depend on the technology to function as is the case of uber or airbnb for this reason we can say with complete certainty that the financial sector in the not to distant future wil depend on technology as hapened with the advertising or entertainment and even the figure of cash

mno what does it tel us about the advantages and asociated to this cost is los of revenue from disadvantages in terms of the rate of which is exacerbated by covid to tune inovation aces security privacy etc of of in the uk in lost oportunities uncontroled development versus regulation consequence of the ban has many implications on which governance areas is it useful or on mnos busines in adition to slowing down even esential for government to focus if we in rol out of one impact is option limitation are to develop an efective and eficient in pol of equipment vendors which is reduced next generation ecosystem to efectively only two major ones that are ericson and nokia to met the global demand what governance areas are best adresed other negative implications are same as suply by industry organisations and initiatives and demand like any market that can increase what aspects should be left to emerge from cost and impair after sales quality of service the operation of the market and suport this restriction does not only what would an ideal digital governance impact equipment it afects mnos who have system lok like asuming global coperation equipment from hrv as wel is initialy were posible deployed as non standalone network meaning radio radio and core are neded to be deploye together however equipment what chalenges wil the rol out of from one vendor canot be easily used to and the emergence of new use cases in suport equipment from another vendor diferent vertical sectors and the both and equipment have to be from the involvement of new players create same vendor in handling interoperability and ofers thre distinct capabilities in adresing integration problems as most legacy system societal and industry curent neds and in are from huawei that means deployment of suport of range of posible future use cases first requires replacement of huawei digital industry governance and equipment with that of another vendor and smal companies to participate in global this wil further delay deployment of suply ecosystem however oran technology is networks and services ofering with huawei far from being ready for mas deployment being bared from some markets and leaving in terms of performance in capacity limited ericson and nokia as the main options to fil in environment such as in urban area curent the gap in market question is would these two oran solutions performance is by far les than vendors have suficient delivery capacity to met that of making oran when is available the market demand and whether their products only suitable for les capacity demanding are mature enough with at least similar environments such as suburban areas performance and cost as that of huawei this wil be the case until high capacity oran is developed which wil not be the case to minimise the impact of dependency on few before diversification of suply chain vendors governments and mobile network requires open and standardised interfaces to operators mno are rightly in favour of facilitate integration and interoperation of diversification of suply chain and suport open diferent sub system solutions from diferent radio aces network oran architecture vendors to be developed and integrated in where diferent companies can provide diferent complete oran architecture aspects of radio aces network this brings about huge oportunities for many more large figure oran generic architecture from ran aliance from reference digital industry governance and goran architecture is based on many open managed by mnos but network slice is interfaces as can be sen in figure compared exclusively alocated for specific enterprise with traditional closed ran however the for industrial aplications is best deployed in greater the number of open interfaces the more form of stand alone network this means architecture is prone to network security and tha they do not ned being complemented with risks of interoperability betwen diferent network stand alone network is products from diferent vendors another factor complete end to end technology consisting of that contributes to rol out delays is that for new radio gnr and core service non standalone network nsa as is curent based architecture sba core sba is option for rolout the market neds oran flexible for easy upgrades with future functions products for both ran as wel as ran and future services through virtualisation of functions and separation betwen functions in both urlc and mtc are incorporated in software and underlying hardware platform specifications by design for eficient suport stand alone in form of public wide area and of vertical sectors and industrial aplications private non public is yet to be developed for they are to suport many devices machines comercial use thus stand alone capability is and sensors of diferent capabilities as wel as one of the technical reasons for delay in the mision critical aplications where reliability adoption of in vertical industries and or low latency conectivity is required in industrial setings other reasons for delay in rol out are the fact that for industrial aplications where guaranted these capabilities can suport diferent low latency is esential for time critical use cases deployments of network namely stand alone the urlc aspect of is yet to be available and non standalone and in the form of private comercialy moreover further research and networks public networks or combination of standardisation is required for high capacity private and public networks or hybrid urlc which is subject of study in release deployment private network is strictly under of that may not be completed before ful control of vertical industry whereas public september as shown in figure network is managed by mnos for wide area mobile broadband hybrid networks are mainly figure standard roadmap for and beyond digital industry governance and for mas conectivity again the standardisation private network is deployed without celular work is in progres in the release of gp operator service provider the second scenario these are mainly technical and standardisation private is the chosen path by some isues that have contributed to deployment industries mainly because of network and data delay from non technical points of view security where company data and intelectual industrial use of is mainly busines to properties are important however as such busines model isue betwen mnos and industries do not have apropriate skils in vertical enterprises for the hybrid deployment telecom network operation and management deployment whether in form of private or the barier is to have people with such skil sets hybrid neds apreciation of network which are fundamentaly diferent from people capability as wel as compeling busines case with it skils the use of digital twins provides by vertical industries on impacts on their some insight in the network operation and cost saving and or new source of revenue identify through apropriate alarms point and enhancement in their productivity of failure or anomaly in trafic behaviour those vertical industries that have publicly digital twin solutions for vertical non telecom anounced their strategy in adopting private industries is therefore an important mising deployment justify their case by puting technology to give peace of mind to vertical high importance in the first place on their industry in embracing as conectivity requirements on stringent network security platform and reliability of operation of beter than in the scenario of celular network of time as wel as on being in control provider mno could ofer suport and of their own busines data maintenance and provide secure network slice aditionaly lack of necesary skils in network capacity to busines network slicing management and operation of private in technology is subject of standardisation and is non telecom industry is another factor that has yet to be developed by equipment vendors for hindered adoption of some of these points comercial use however for this busines are further elaborated on in the folowing model to become aceptable win win sections busines model neds to be in place betwen mobile service providers and other industry sectors so that verticals can apreciate cost what chalenges wil the rol out of savings and or increase in revenue in adopting and the emergence of new use cases in system this wil hapen over time but wil diferent vertical sectors and the take some time as verticals ned to apreciate involvement of new players create and understand importance of conectivity is diferent from previous generations of to their busines productivity and costs mobile wireles systems in the sense that its these are some god lesons to learn from the inovative capabilities are designed for use in way standardisation was conducted from industry environment to improve productivity the begining the verticals should have ben through automation reliability and low and involved with the telecom sector in identifying guaranted latency in conectivity is more their specific requirements and in development about conecting machines or internet of things of standards vertical industries examples are iot than conecting people as was the case health manufacturing automotive logistics with previous generations and so on of course al these use cases ned to for vertical industry use cases jury is stil out on have clear busines cases an important and win win busines model for stake holders in enabling factor in adoption of any new arangement or when non public or technology some of requirements from vertical digital industry governance and gindustries are security latency reliability networks are also under tight control of mobile resilience and interoperability with legacy it network operators that ensure user identity system privacy and data security global standard facilitates global market and due to this to help with faster adoption of technologies economy of scale enables fast return on and establishment of comon understating investment inovation in mobile networks are more joint technology and use case trials ned mainly in technology whereas inovation in to be conducted betwen actors from diferent internet is in aplications and contents sectors it is not to late to do so as future development of standards in release and unlike previous mobile generations with the posibly and are about industrial use purpose of conecting people is solution to societal and industrial chalenges in the to cases and its autonomous operation period it is about conecting machines of diferent sizes and capabilities integrates what are the lesons can draw from the number of services from diferent industries into rapid development and huge suces in one unified architecture whilst maintaining quality of service through advanced technical terms of usage and value creation of the solutions such as network slicing and is future internet what does it tel us about the prof for easy incorporation of yet unforesen advantages and disadvantages in terms of services and functionalities through network the rate of inovation aces security virtualisation and its service based architecture privacy etc of uncontroled development sba over the time wil become an open versus regulation fabric of conectivity tailored capacity conectivity and security and privacy wil be internet is based on simple ip internet ofered by network operators to other industries protocols that enable variety of systems to be as network as service nas platform easily integrated this simplicity in networking is through standard and open interfaces at the expense of compromising quality reliability security and privacy it is also combination of above features wil help in developing

dynamicaly regulators ned to move down and alocate or verify authorise and certify devices machines re farm suficient radio spectrum to help that belong to network or to an organisation network operators to provide cost eficient blockchain for example is posible technology coverage for this multi lateral trust algorithm however digital infrastructure must adopt open secure blockchain sufers from energy consumption and standardised interfaces so that any busines and requirements for huge amount of could outsource or develop its own services and signaling resertach therefore ned to focus on aplications open infrastructure with open and finding new algorithm an eficient trust standard interfaces wil help with diversification framework should be defined by standard in technology and the services content bodies that facilitates busines to develop its ecosystem the interfaces should be based on own trust algorithm whilst does not violating comon standard to ease interoperability at

international director of public policy and advocacy bentley systems peter el haj national digital twin programe lead centre for digital built britainforeword alexandra bolton the finance industry has long ben at the forefront of using data and technology to make beter decisions to de risk to improve return on investments and to create beter outcomes tackling the big chalenges of our day climate change and resilience energy healthcare relies on having the right technologies and data to make the right interventions at centre for digital built britain cdb we have sen how digital twins can improve decision making in the planing design build and operation of asets we have also sen the benefits of conecting digital twins acros organisations and sectors the finance comunity has huge oportunity to realise the benefits of digital twins by using them to ad value track sustainability targets atract new investments and manage risk beter however colaboration acros the industry is key when we colaborate acros boundaries acros borders we can do amazing things we can make beter busines decisions that drive beter economic social and environmental outcomes on behalf of cdb would like to thank everyone involved in this paper mark coates and bentley systems for their leadership which was key to making this paper reality and al who so generously shared their expertise experience and knowledge am excited to se how the finance comunity wil join with the wider infrastructure comunity and solution providers to use higher quality data and digital twins to improve investment returns met esg goals and create the sustainable future we al want to se how finance and digital twins can shape beter future for the planetdigital twins centre for digital built britain cdb describes digital twin as digital representation of an aset system or proces what distinguishes digital twin from any other digital model is its conection to the physical twin based on data from the physical aset or system digital twin unlocks value by suporting improved decision making which creates the oportunity for positive fedback into the physical twin digital twin can be dynamic capturing curent performance data from the physical twin or static model of system with input of long term condition data from the physical twin via corporate reporting systems and the capital investment proces how finance and digital twins can shape beter future for the planetbeter outcomes for al how the finance comunity can shape the future of digital twins at the heart of the transforming infrastructure performance programe lies the ned for step change in productivity it wil require data from al parts of the syste to inform decision making from improved information management in delivery to the creation of digital twins for aset maintenance and optimisation nick smalwod ceo infrastructure and projects authority in recent years there has ben an explosion of interest in the potential role of digital twins in the transformation of how infrastructure and the built environment are planed designed constructed and operated modern digital aproaches are at the heart of an emerging government industry change programe captured in the work of the centre for digital built britain cdb and in key documents such as the construction playbok transforming infrastructure performance road map to and the gemini papers during the five years of the cdb programe we have sen step change in the quality of the dialogue betwen industry academia and the public sector it has created greater shared understanding of the use cases and benefits of digital twins at al stages of the aset lifecycle as wel as having unlocked increased investment in digital solutions that have generated ever more economic social and environmental benefits the catalyst for this paper was to ask if the same has ben true for the dialogue betwen an increasingly tight knit industry driving the digital transformation of infrastructure and the investors insurers banks and other institutions who provide much of their funding and finance to answer this question we have spoken with wide range of investors to get beter understanding of how and why they are curently using infrastructure related data as wel as their level of knowledge and interest in the potential of digital twins our conclusion is that there is huge untaped potential for investors to influence how data is used to improve infrastructure decision making and that taking on greater role in the digital transformation of infrastructure wil provide beter outcomes for busineses people and nature there is also significant oportunity to leverage digital twins to suport key chalenges facing the finance comunity where to alocate capital screning and managing risk enhancing aset value by improving performance and reliability and complying with environmental social and governance esg requirements the key to unlocking this potential is to aply the fundamentals of the information value chain the finance comunity can colaborate with the wider industry to develop practical use cases that help them use the insights derived from data to solve their most presing problems make beter decisions and create more value the infrastructure sector neds to play its part and aproach this dialogue with openes and flexibility infrastructure profesionals ned to understand that investors generate their return on investment roi in variety of ways via diferent types of asets and at diferent stages of the infrastructure lifecycle some of their use cases overlap with those al ready developed for suply chain busineses or operators while others wil not in the remainder of this paper we set out thre steps for improving the quality of the dialogue betwen investors and other parts of the infrastructure sector re imagine the information value chain from an investor perspective explore how investors can expand their leadership role and share some use cases investors are curently pursuing finaly in the spirit of encouraging dialogue and colaboration the paper ends with series of open questions that we hope wil kick start debate that wil bring investors into the heart of the efort to digitaly transform infrastructure performance how finance and digital twins can shape beter future for the planetimproving colaboration betwen the finance comunity and the wider infrastructure sector step understanding the variety of infrastructure investors and what that means for the diferent ways that they can benefit from digital twins the first step to bringing investors into the heart of the debate on digital twin adoption is simply to recognise that they are not homogeneous undiferentiated group infrastructure investor is broad term that embraces range of institutions that invest in the debt or equity of infrastructure asets or busineses investors may fund the construction of new grenfield asets or acquire operational brownfield asets there are numerous types of infrastructure investors pursuing variety of strategies to achieve roi private equity firms and aset managers typicaly invest pols of funds on behalf of institutional investors such as pension funds insurers or sovereign wealth funds funds wil hold these stakes for diferent lengths of time depending on their investment strategy but it wil normaly be at least thre to five years fund managers use their expertise to suport aset managers to maximise performance revenues and re sale value they wil normaly receive an anual management fe based on the value of the fund and be entitled not loking to share of gros profits for grand comercial banks provide both debt and equity depending on their investment strategy debt may be in vision ned the form of the purchase of bonds isued by infrastructure aset owners or loans secured against the aset something isuers of debt wil normaly be more hands of than an equity investor and have shorter term interest in the underlying aset scalable institutional investors pension and or sovereign wealth funds may also employ their own interoperable internal teams to invest directly in the equity of infrastructure asets and busineses major players inteligible in the market include big canadian pension funds and the sovereign wealth funds of states such as abu dhabi and singapore and above development banks are national regional or financial institutions that provide debt equity and guarantes al useful for higher risk infrast ructure investments normaly in developing countries that canot be suported in their entirety by private markets development banks are typicaly set up by governments or non profit organisations and normaly operate to policy mandates seting out the social economic and environmental objectives to be suported by the bank activities examples include the european bank for reconstruction and development the new infrastructure bank has many of the characteristics of development bank and is providing gbp bilion of finance to suport climate change and leveling up objectives others key stakeholders include insurers advisors and guarante providers how finance and digital twins can shape beter future for the planetstep understanding how investors categorise infrastructure second step is to understand how digital twins are likely to relate to how the finance comunity typicaly categorises infrastructure many investors divide the sector into four categories of oportunities se figure below category description examples source of revenue rates charged to users agred energy rail road water upon with regulators and waste utilities asets esential core long term contracts with for society schols hospitals and government counterparties other social infrastructure based on availability or similar payment mechanism contracted power similar to the core generation long term contracts category but with potential core plus for greater variability of tol roads airport concesion arangement cash flows and seaports grenfield projects that new build utility wil become core asets schol or hospital long and short term post construction projects contracts value aded asets with oportunities data centres revenues from for growth expansion air or seaport expanded services or repositioning expansion asets in emerging markets contracts with les asets in financial distres merchant power reliable counterparties oportunistic generation or asets exposed to waste procesing volatile revenues high level of cost or revenue uncertainty how finance and digital twins can shape beter future for the planetstep relating digital twin use cases to diferent investor strategies third step is to link potential use cases for digital twins to how investors build investment strategies at the most basic level infrastructure is sen as an atractive investment because it ofers stable reliable returns often backed by government counterparty in times of economic uncertainty investments in real physical asets that provide esential government suported services are unsurprisingly particularly atractive behind that general rule however lies variety of aproaches to generating an aceptable roi figure below source preqin shows how the four categories of infrastructure can form the basis of strategies based on expected roi risk apetite and the balance betwen generating returns from maximising revenues or profits from the re sale of asets regulated asets and social infrastructure reimagining the information value chain for investors the use cases for digital twin wil vary for diferent types of infrastructure investors pursing diferent strategies the fundamentals of building use case for deriving value from data are however no diferent for investors than for any other organisation colecting data has no inherent value it must be used to make beter decisions that lead to improved outcomes sense making is neded to convert data into

source hm government grening finance and roadmap to sustainable investing the sustainable disclosure requirements wil create single integrated framework for decision useful disclosures on esg related isues it wil cover thre categories of disclosures corporate disclosures requirements for companies including financial services busineses to make sustainability disclosures this reporting wil adhere to agred international standards aset manager and aset owner disclosures new requirements for aset managers and aset owners including ocupational pension schemes to disclose how they take sustainability into acount in their decision making investment product disclosure new requirements for creators of investment products to report on the products sustainability impact and relevant financial risks and oportunities this information wil also form the basis of new sustainable investment labeling regime how finance and digital twins can shape beter future for the planet in adition despite brexit the eu sustainable finance disclosure regulation wil afect anyone raising money from investors inside the eu and there are signs that the is moving in similar direction in recent article on infrastructure esg revolution gordon bajnai head of global infrastructure at private equity busines campbel lutyens sumed up the curent situation sectors such as energy and transportation have measurable impact on our eforts to decarbonise the world while sectors such as digital have huge role to play in bridging divides in society esg measument reporting and benchmarking have become standard in infrastructure if you want to raise money these things are must haves and not nice to have this situation is creating big demand for proceses and technology to monitor measure and report on esg risks acros an investor portfolio it also means that esg asesments are playing greater role in due diligence proceses for lending as wel as for the buying and seling of asets by equity investors unfortunately as recent survey published by preqin demonstrates the finance comunity is being held back by lack of consistent high quality data fund manager views on the main chalenges of implementing an esg policy lack of quality consistent esg data confusion over industry terminology shortage of knowledge or expertise political or regulatory uncertainty dificulty in delivering both financial and non financial returns excesive costs lack of consensus from internal stakeholders not relvant to our strategy or mandate lack of quality investment oportunities fiduciary concerns proportion of respondents source preqin fund manager survey november the ned for step change in the quality and usefulnes of esg related data loks like one of the greatest information chalenges facing the finance comunity and perhaps the single bigest use case for digital twin that can create bridge betwen financial data physical asets and the natural environment how can investors take more active leadership role it is necesary for the infrastructure sector to improve how it engages with infrastructure investors in fact it is vital if we want those investors to play biger role in driving the rol out of digital twins of built environment asets investors themselves ned to take the initiative and use their leverage to encourage creating digital twins in ways that align to their interests talking with investors it was once again clear that diferent types of investors have diferent oportunities to take this leadership role one way to think about this is through the lens of investors diferent relationships with the organisations planing constructing and maintaining infrastructure asets how finance and digital twins can shape beter future for the planetdebt incentivising the creation of be ter quality data banks providing debt to infrastructure busineses or project based special purpose vehicles have very transactional relationship they lend money to suport the creation expansion and maintenance of asets and then receive repayment at an agred rate of interest in an agred upon time frame these loans are normaly secured against asets and lenders have first cal on their revenues or resale value if things do not go acording to plan however they wil not receive any share of the upside if the asets outperform therefore lenders oportunities to influence digitalisation are generaly shorter term and linked to their ned to de risk lending and met their reporting and regulatory requirements as eficiently as posible one public private partnership equity investor talked us through how they used spatial temporal digital twin developed for mega project to demonstrate to their banks that risks were being managed efectively during the construction and comisioning phase this technology alowed the investor to secure market leading rates from the consortia of banks providing the debt finance for the project we are also aware of cases like that of great portland estates gpe who in signed gbp milion esg linked revolving credit facility rcf as part of its plan to become net zero by this inovative facility the first to be isued by real estate investment trust incorporates thre esg linked key performance indicators kpis aligned to gpe sustainability strategy these kpis include anual pre agred targets and are based on suporting gpes target to decarbonise its existing buildings and reducing the energy intensity of its portfolio by by suporting gpes target to build net zero carbon new buildings from providing beter quality urban grening measures by increasing biodiversity acros gpes portfolio gpe lenders have agred that decrease or increase of up to basis points wil be aplied to their headline margin based on performance against the kpis in both cases the bank goals were not to drive the digital transformation of buildings and infrastructure these targets incentivise gpe to acelerate the decarbonisation of their busines and wil suport continued behavioural change acros their suply chain however it is easy to se how the existence and use of high quality up to date data linked to the physical asets increased their confidence that construction was being de risked and that esg kpis were being met these examples demonstrate that there is case for big lenders to get on the front fot and be more vocal about the digital information that they want to se alongside the physical asets that they are financing and translate it into competitive interest rates and other returns as one interviewe told us when people price big infrastructure jobs they price what they don know as the information improves they have to go lean because the risks are known equity maximising the value of asets equity investors on the other hand usualy take higher risk but share in increased revenues during the lifetime of their investment and can sel on their stakes at profit therefore their busines model typicaly already involves working closely with owners and operators on improvement plans this situation opens up many more oportunities to drive progres including through digital transformation initiatives it is particularly true for investors with larger portfolios often spread acros many counties one such investor explained to us how they sought to ensure at least base level of digitisation acros the busineses in which they had equity stakes teling us if you have two wind farms and one has some form of digital twin and one just pdf with some anual performance reporting it obvious that for the owner and their enginers the former is les risky and it is clearer where we can ad value then when it comes to re sale asets that have transparent life history are more transactionable how finance and digital twins can shape beter future for the planethis investor explained that they helped local managers to exploit the benefits of being part of the fund portfolio for example helping smaler local utility in one country work with larger busineses in the same sector to aces digital expertise and share knowledge the construction and infrastructure sectors have for decades talked about the importance of inteligent clients many of the equity investors that we spoke with talked about the importance of being an inteligent shareholder big part of which is having plans to increase the digital maturity of their asets government catalysing data sharing for the public god one final category of investor that has leadership role to play is government the public sector provides much of the finance that goes into the infrastructure many of the wider benefits from beter infrastructure data derive not solely from digital twins of individual asets but also from the ability to share data safely and securely acros organisational and sectoral boundaries to realise the systematic benefits of beter data and conected digital twins governments must play catalysing convening conecting and co ordinating role as demonstrated by such initiatives as the cdb own national digital twin programe and the national infrastructure comision data for the public god study our interviews highlighted several intriguing oportunities for government seing benefits the government of quensland in australia is sponsoring the cros river rail project to build new kilometer rail line in brisbane influenced by its conversations with the crosrail project cros river is much more rail the public company delivering the railway has invested heavily in detailed digital twin of the project important th an the potential uses of the model go beyond the delivery and operation and maintenance of the rail embracing infrastructure for example the original goal of the cros river rail project was to monitor the roadway however there are riple efects of this digital twin project the rail organization can now measure trafic in leading edge certain areas and make investments in the right infrastructure our view is that the model has the potential technology to form the basis of city wide digital twin conected ecosystem that can deliver benefits by suporting investment decision making on city wide basis this type of digital twin would deliver value greater than the sum of its parts especialy in the run up to brisbane hosting of the olympics other publicly funded mega projects have leway in their budgets to make these kind of anchor investments they can also use their influence to establish de facto norms for data management and interoperability elsewhere investors are loking to exploit public data sets that might not normaly be asociated with an infrastructure digital twin we spoke to one investor who is exploring how they could align their in house corporate data with public data sets relating to measures such as educational atainment crime and local economic development this aplication would open oportunities for investors to demonstrate how their activity was contributing to policy goals with the potential for more efective alocation of resources and the creation of new income streams for investors the quality acuracy and acesibility of these data sets remain barier to realising this vision despite the eforts of the ofice of national statistics cabinet ofice and others however our investor was convinced that if government worked to make beter quality data openly available private sector players would lean in and develop new solutions to help met national goals like net zero what kind of use cases are investors interested in in our conversations with diferent types of investors we heard about variety of curent and potential use cases here are just few examples how can use data and digital maturity to help increase the value of asets while equity investors have diferent strategies for how long they want to hold on to asets they wil lok to sel on at profit at some point several interviewes told us that they are developing strategies to ensure that asets are more digitaly mature at re sale they are confident that it provides an objective demonstration of high performance and reduced risk that wil increase re sale value enhanced performance wil also increase revenues during the period of ownership and can help crowd in further value enhancing investment how finance and digital twins can shape beter future for the planethow can use data and digital maturity to scren esg impacts and comply with regulations multinational development banks explained to us that they have fundamental ned to demonstrate the impact of their investments against variety of economic social and environmental metrics they told us that they are exploring actively how digital technologies can improve the eficiency and transparency of how impact is measured we also heard from investors in social and economic infrastructure about an oportunity to go beyond esg reporting and open up potential new revenue streams by demonstrating direct corelation betwen their investments and government policy goals such as crime reduction or educational atainment these investors are loking to work with digital specialists to blend publicly available data such as crime figures with their own in house data more broadly investors also face host of esg and safety related reporting requirements these demands are creating one of the most powerful use cases amongst investors for beter data safety the grenfel tower tragedy has ushered in renewed focus from government and regulators on the safety of higher risk buildings the buildings safety act is expected to receive royal asent in the first half of with significant changes to duties around risk management being phased in over the subsequent month period the act builds on the findings of dame judith hackit review of building regulations and fire safety dame judith recomended the introduction of robust golden thread of key information to alow al parties to use information to safely and efectively design construct and operate their buildings she stated that this data must be pased to future building owners to underpin more efective safety management the recomendations and the subsequent legislation are intended to adres the problems within the industry of vital information not being efectively managed or sometimes not even available in usable form to ensure that the right people have the information that they ned to ensure the safety of buildings the act also requires that the data be used to create safety case owned by an acountable person in practice it means acountable persons normaly the landlord or freholder wil ned to demonstrate that risks have ben identified and asesed and that credible plan is in place to reduce or control them to an apropriate level these plans must be maintained and regular reports must be submited to regulators how can optimise energy performance real estate equity investors told us that improving energy performance was the single most apealing use case for digital twins in their world suces would tick esg and carbon reduction boxes while promising to enhance roi via performance improvements and enhanced user experience these investors are actively exploring how scenario modeling and analysis can help identify the interventions with the greatest energy performance benefits how can mitigate risks created by bad data the grenfel tragedy is educating the whole built environm ent sector on the human reputational legal and financial risks created by por or incomplete data the building safety act wil be phased in over the next months introducing the requirement to maintain golden thread of aset information through the lifetime of the highest risk buildings it shows how beter data practices up to and including the creation of digital twins can mitigate the risks created by por data which is an increasingly compeling use case for many investors how finance and digital twins can shape beter future for the planethow can maximise my income from availability payments many investors have revenue streams tied to payment mechanisms based on performance standards such as lane availability on their roads or clasroms heated in their schols these investors are pursuing use cases for digital twins that help investors maximise revenue by ensuring operational teams are alerted when action is neded to head of any drop in service levels this data can also provide historic record of performance useful for proving compliance with contractual obligations over the course of the contract how can reduce my cost of capital one investor talked us through how they used spatial temporal digital twin developed for mega project to demonstrate to banks that the construction and comisioning risks were being managed efectively by the project delivery team this situation alowed them to secure market leading rates from the consortia of banks providing the debt finance for the project moving the conversation forward the goal of this white paper has ben to kick start dialogue that can bring infrastructure investors closer to the centre of eforts driving digital transformation of the infrastructure sector instead of finishing with traditional conclusion we decided to convert some of the themes explored throughout the paper into series of questions that initiate that conversation these questions are by no means an exhaustive list and we are very hapy to be told other questions are more important the key however is to start the conversation infrastructure is what changes do digital twin solution providers ned to make and how they paradoxicaly very operate to beter serve infrastructure investor interests simple from an investor point in our conversations with infrastructure investors we picked up hint of frustration that some digital twin solution providers focus on pitching the capabilities of technology rather than focusing on investors of view but also problems and how digital twins can provide solutions we were also reminded that investors are not very murky there enginers or digital specialists and ned these solutions explained to them in their language is no blomberg can digital twin solution providers change their mindset and play more proactive role in comunicating for infrastructure the benefits of digital twins to investors working with them to co create solut ions that met their contractual busines neds as first step can they pul together some existing use cases that can realy comunicate and celebrate suces relationships mean information can be can we reach consensus on the most promising use cases and realy ambiguous set some shared chalenges as we have sen there are many use cases already being explored by infrastructure investors can dialogue betwen the investor comunity and the infrastructure sector reach consensus on what are the most presing and promising can we set some shared chalenges what level of digital information wil realy be neded to serve them is visualization the requirement or can neds be met at least in the first instance by something simpler should digital maturity asesment be standard part of investors due diligence proces we heard from several investors who have developed simple metrics to ases the digital maturity of the people and organisations in which they are investing they help with risk asesment and identifying oportunities for ading value to the asets and bariers to their realisation should these steps become much more standard part of the due diligence proces is there role for non comercial players like cdb and its sucesors to help codify and standardise digital maturity the sophistication of an infrastructure owner cyber security measures wil be key metric in any digital maturity asesment one development bank told us that many of the projects that they invest in form part of developing countries critical national infrastructure suporting the digitalisation of these nations energy grid or similar projects not only delivers real economic social and environmental benefits but also increases vulnerability to cyber atacks in response the bank has taken very top down aproach to using its leverage to improve data security and standards as wel as ensuring that the maturity exists to maintain them over time how finance and digital twins can shape beter future for the planetin the comercial market we heard that fears about the aditional complexity and risk created by cyber security can be barier to investors embracing digital inovation how can solution providers and the finance comunity colaborate more efectively to deal with the chalenges of cyber security are there lesons that can be transfered from development banking into the comercial sector what wil make providers of debt ofer competitive interest rates for asets with digital twins we heard from one investor who had secured highly competitive terms from banks that are providing debt for grenfield mega project the use of digital twins to de risk the construction phase played key role we know that some banks have ben wiling to ofer competitive rates to projects demonstrating performance against esg targets something that generates strong use case for comprehensive aset and performance data can we encourage banks to be more proactive in ofering competitive lending terms to projects utilising digital twin technology to adres these risks and oportunities are there other motivations that the sector could tap into what more can governments do to help cros river rail in brisbane is an example of where publicly sponsored mega project can provide the catalyst for city level digital twin that can suport beter investment decisions as it the we also heard that some of the most useful data sets for building use case are those held by governments or agencies it can include data neded to ases the impact of investments such as changes to crime rates operational educational atainment and economic development unfortunately many of these data sets are patchy results that or out of date can government be encouraged to tackle this problem and then to chalenge the industry to lean into this data to drive progres towards big policy goals like leveling up and net zero wil give us the momentum to engage the takeaways the goal of this white paper has ben to kick start dialogue that can bring infrastructure investors closer to the centre of eforts driving digital transformation of the infrastructure sector the value of information management in the construction and infrastructure sector report estimated that every gbp invested in information management could potentialy secure up to gbp of labour time savings al while bosting government eforts to reach net zero carbon emisions by five takeaways are proposed to advance digital twins and unlock their benefits for the finance comunity adopt the gemini principles in your digital strategies cdb is caling on leaders involved in managing and investing in the built environment to build the gemini principles into their digital strategies the principles enable values based aproach for the development of digital twins and alignment for organisations digital twins to suport esg reporting there is great data chalenge facing the finance comunity in terms of aces acuracy and consistency of data this chalenge is on the critical path for esg reporting digital twins should be built on high quality data and there is large overlap betwen data required for esg reporting and data neded for managing of asets advancing the use of digital twins wil drive beter data quality and improve chances for timely esg reporting open data to unlock its value data has value in isolation and an increased value is realised when it is shared and conected open data does not mean that everyone has aces to the data but rather means that data is shareable within the ecosystem of partners clients and the suply chain acording to the gemini principles data must be as open as posible while remaining consistent with the principles of holistic security to create maximum value for everyone including data from many sources is esential to maximising value of digital twins ases and upskil digital capabilities the changes brought by digitisation are driving ned for new services acros the industry such as cyber resilience data enginering data science and software development organisations in the finance comunity should ases digital capabilities and upskil as required to ensure resilient and productive value chain that is fit for the future how finance and digital twins can shape beter future for the planet colaborate the finance comunity is core to the infrastructure industry and is positioned to reap benefits of beter comunication and information sharing acros the industry established comunities like the digital twin hub are great place to shape the future of digital twins in the industry by sharing suces stories and lesons learned as wel as conect to others involved with digital twins cdb has worked closely with the industry academia and the government to explore and create solutions for the chalenges facing the built environment the gemini papers present their learnings from the past five years capturing the consensus viewpoint of the conected digital twin comunity and serving as blueprint for future leaders the finance comunity is in strong position to lead the industry forward next steps join the conversation this white paper is one of the final pieces from the centre for digital built britain which completes its mision at the end of march however many of its activities wil continue including the digital twin hub which has created comunity of infrastructure profesionals who are comited to change as members of that comunity we are comited to working with coleagues to bring investors into the mainstream of the movement and to drive the digital transformation of the infrastructure sector creating beter outcomes for people and the planet if you would like to be part of that efort or have views on any of the questions or isues raised in this paper we would love to hear from you you can get in touch via the digital twin hub or

initiatives for employes robust structures for efective colaboration and comunication conclusion introduction background the uk construction industry has ben frequently berated for its problems of low productivity delays unsafe work practices and the delivery of projects that exced planed costs to tackle these problems the government has ramped up eforts to drive an increase in the use of digital technologies and manufacturing aproaches for delivering construction projects and managing built asets building information modeling bim and ofsite manufacturing osm have ben put forward as the two key inovations that can be used to deliver projects faster cheaper safer and at higher quality the curent industrial strategy is the construction sector deal outlines the government partnership with industry to promote the use of bim and osm to reduce construction and whole lifecycle aset costs by over third reduce delays in construction project delivery and grenhouse gas emisions by half in the construction playbok recently published by the cabinet ofice sets out how the government is prioritising the deployment of these inovations through public sector procurement in order to make their use mainstream in the construction industry for any of these goals to be achieved the construction industry neds to embrace the use of bim and osm on large scale however this wil only hapen if construction firms consultants general contractors specialist subcontractors are able to adopt and use bim and osm sucesfuly despite this critical ned for engagement both take up and use remain low there are several reasons for this and the lack of evidence of the real benefits of the use of bim and osm has made construction firms reluctant to embrace their adoption wolstenholme never waste god

employes and robust structures for efective colaboration and comunication the insights shared in this guidance draw on interviews with over construction industry stakeholders in the uk contractors consultants and clients who have undertaken comercial residential and infrastructure projects acros the country and overseas nine recomendations are put forward in this guidance document designed to guide construction firms taking steps to adopt and use bim and osm the recomendations are specificaly targeted at senior executives and managers of construction firms regardles of size who can implement initiatives to enable their firms to adopt and use bim and osm or improve what is already in place what does it take to sucesfuly adopt and use digital technologies and ofsite manufacturing figure ilustrates how the leadership and management of firm is crucial for creating framework within which al the other factors can be implemented it also shows how implementation of these factors has both internal and external implications for firms figure enabling factors in the sections that folow each factor is described and suported by relevant industry examples and key recomendations for implementation by other construction firms comited leadership and management firm neds comited leadership to suport the proces of change having leader who wil champion the digital transformation vision within firm is esential for suces transformation agenda canot focus solely on technology but must consider individual practices and internal culture in order to sucesfuly establish new ways of working among employes for transformation strategy to trickle down through firm leaders ned to believe in the strategies they are implementing leader champion can be an executive or manager who believes in the urgency of digital transformation its long term benefits and who is comited to implementing the necesary strategies to achieve the vision this wil involve comunicating the digital strategy and vision in ways that apeal to employes and their work related aspirations engagement neds to be personalised and people focused and spearheaded by manager or comite who understands this and is able to comunicate clearly and coherently acros al areas of the firm and its suply chain suportive leadership culture values employe sugestions ensuring that input from employes is treated in way that shows that they are valued is important because this has direct impact on employes wilingnes to be part of the transformation factor that can either constrain or facilitate digital transformation when employes se that their sugestions have ben implemented in company practices it can bost their participation in the digitalisation agenda to ensure that employes are genuinely involved in the transformation journey it is crucial for management to comunicate regularly and clearly with employes and be open to receiving fedback this is important for sucesful digital transformation leadership training resources are available through the construction industry training board citb thre years funded scheme giving leaders the skils to drive digital transformation the national construction colege nc management and supervisory courses and the suply chain sustainability schol range of courses al designed to give leaders in construction firms the skils to drive

transformation agenda where new technologies and practices are introduced employes are treated as individuals and their carer aspirations are taken into consideration in paralel with the task changes that wil ned to take place internal and external inovation competitions are used as strategy for motivating employes to gain recognition for digital inovation internal competitions recognise project teams that have over year ben able to met specific targets related to the use of digital technologies recognition by external industry awards also serves as big bost for the team since they know they are working in one of the best firms in the industry when it comes to using these digital inovations recomendations apoint digital transformation leader champion it is crucial for construction firms to apoint person or team who wil champion the transformation vision and who is comited to the urgency of digital transformation and who wil drive and overse the implementation of digital transformation plan the leader champion neds to hold an executive or management position as this creates employe confidence in the transformation vision and agenda profile _finlr_nov pdf lead by example senior executives and managers in construction firms implementing digital transformation plan should aim to drive the vision internaly at every oportunity and on al projects leadership by example demonstrates comitment to the digital transformation agenda showing how the vision can be realised through everyday internal and project related activities leaders should foster employe confidence in the vision the implementation strategy and the expected outcomes from the transformation journey lead people don focus solely on technology whilst geting the right technology is important focusing atention solely on technology tends to relegate an important aspect of achieving digital transformation changing people perspectives it is important to develop leadership plan that focuses on enabling people to fulfil their potential whilst embracing the use of new technologies leadership that focuses on changing the minds of people by apealing to their individual work related aspirational goals enables employes to achieve goals for the use of digital technologies digital transformation strategy with realistic objectives digital transformation strategy is plan that shows where firm is at outlines vison of change and provides guidance for how that change wil be achieved in the future clear digital transformation strategy should be developed and implemented by construction firms seking to make greater use of digital technologies and osm sucesful digital transformation strategy provides step by step map of how to create new firm culture around the use of new technologies tols are available to help firms ases their curent digital capabilities and competencies and to benchmark them against potential competitors so that future actions can be improved construction firms seking to undergo digital transformation wil benefit from undertaking such an asesment prior to developing their digital transformation strategy digital strategy should be geared towards establishing new routines and practices and creating new firm culture with focus on people proceses routines and technology our research sugests that digital strategy that achieves transformation uses simple language to comunicate the goal of transformation gives employes sense of shared ownership in what is to be achieved is consistent and can be repeated acros the firm

alows lcos to incorporate any unique digital neds of clients and projects into the overarching national digital strategy through the local strategy the national and local strategies are therefore aligned to achieve the same transformation objectives the incorporation of local digital strategies by the lcos has created an avenue for employes to propose new digital technologies for consideration prior to adoption new technologies are examined to ascertain their fit with the company strategic goals and proceses this step provides an oportunity to establish the individual and colective benefits

index top construction companies acesible via recomendation design simple clear and people focused digital transformation strategy that can be easily comunicated construction firms regardles of size ned to develop digital strategy that sets out realistic transformation objectives in plain language it should be simple easy to understand and consistent it should be consistently comunicated acros al levels and areas of firm and repeated until new firm culture has ben established it is very important that senior executives and management suport and drive the development of the strategy alongside their employes jointly creating digital transformation strategy is critical for ensuring that employes have shared ownership of the vision and objectives that the strategy articulates building capable suplier network through growing together aproach construction firms ned to ensure their suply chain has the necesary skils and capabilities to deliver projects using bim and osm to achieve this they may ned to suport their suply chain to develop these capabilities firms operating as supliers in the construction suply chain are critical for sucesful project execution as contractors are heavily reliant on their suplier networks including general specialist trade subcontractors whilst some contractors have developed capabilities to use bim and osm not al of the firms they work with in their suplier networks wil have such capabilities the sucesful use of bim and osm on projects requires that supliers also have the necesary level of skils and capabilities this may involve firms helping to equip subcontractors so that they can use the same or similar hardware and software or tols when working on projects using bim and osm there are resources available for construction firms to ases their suplier network neds as part of their digital transformation programes some of the large contractors interviewed are adopting growing together aproach to build and upskil suplier network with the necesary capabilities for working on projects that involve the use of bim and osm this suportive aproach involves hosting workshops training sesions and company visits to learn of capability chalenges and to ofer training suport to supliers by adopting this aproach firms have learned about the chalenges faced by their supliers in terms of the digital skils of their staf hardware software and training neds and as result they have ofered bespoke asistance to adres these neds this aproach has also enabled contractors to share the digital and manufacturing capabilities neded for future projects this transparency ensures that suplier firms aware of what they wil ned to kep working on projects with the contractors and is considered to be win win aproach to building competent suplier network the growing together aproach has proven to be particularly useful for construction firms seking to make the transition to using bim and osm with their suplier network building on working relationships that have developed over the years deloite disrupting busines models digital suply networks acesible via industry example skanska skanska is one of the world leading construction and project development companies operating in the residential and comercial property sectors in the nordic region europe and usa skanska has around employes based on their latest turnover this multi award wining company ranks th among the uk top construction companies with their suply chain delivering around of the company turnover skanska digital capability relies heavily on suply chain transformation skanska recognises the ned to suport its suply chain as part of sucesfuly implementing its digital transformation strategy the firm is eager to maintain their longstanding working relationships with these supliers because they have built lot of trust with them part of their aproach involves providing their supliers with aces to training ofered by the suply chain sustainability schol of which skanska is founding member in partnership with the citb the fact that the resources provided are fre to use removes one of the major bariers to upskiling the suply chain another of skanska strategies involves increasingly chalenging their suplier network partners to explore the use of new technologies on projects skanska encourages their supliers to develop the capabilities neded to work with them using these technologies using strategy caled inovation push growing together strategy involves providing the requisite training workshops and regular comunication necesary to inform firms in their suplier network about digital technologies that can be adopted for doing things more quickly and with les labour as wel as how to use more of site aproaches this provides skanska with oportunities to kep their suply chain partners informed about the digital capabilities required for specific projects continuous engagement with their suplier network partners means that skanska is able to learn about capability gaps and suport them in learning proces towards improvement this focus on developing their suplier networks has ben key component for the sucesful implementation of projects using bim and osm recomendation suport your suply chain to develop their digital and osm capabilities large contractors should aim to asist firms in their existing suplier networks to improve or build capabilities in using bim and osm for projects doing so wil save time and resources in establishing new working relationships and in building trust with other firms they may not know wel it is therefore helpful to suport trustworthy and high performing supliers to develop relevant capabilities for using digital technologies and osm this growing together aproach can be achieved through the hosting of workshops and training sesions with subcontractors in order to understand their neds and jointly develop plans to help their development there are mutual benefits to be gained in doing this strong suplier network equiped with digital and manufacturing capabilities is crucial in demonstrating relevant capacity at the tendering stage of projects and critical for sucesful project delivery building trust based relationships with clients clients are key players who can drive inovation in the industry and obtaining their buy in is crucial in order to increase the use of digital technologies and ofsite manufacturing this is particularly important for private sector clients who are under no obligation to use any specific technology or aproach for their projects unlike public sector clients who are obliged to require the use of bim and to give presumption in favour of using osm where it could lead to value for money clients are typicaly concerned about geting the job done at the lowest price in order to maximise returns on investments and using digital technologies and osm is often sen as generating aditional costs which clients are usualy not wiling to bear convincing clients about the use of bim and osm therefore begins with wining trust building trust relationship usualy takes time and involves honest comunication ofering reliable information about the inherent risks and the benefits asociated with these inovations it also involves meting agred expectations regarding the use of bim and osm having mutual respect for values and maintaining god reputation by folowing contractual requirements industry example multiplex at multiplex combination of aproaches is used in order to educate clients and to present them with the busines case for the use of digital technologies fundamental to al the strategies used is building trust at multiplex building trust with clients is achieved by being transparent at the outset about the suitability of specific digital technologies for projects and their posible benefits and by ofering critical profesional advice on suitability for every project they actively engage with clients to ases which aspects would benefit most from the use of specific digital technologies and involve them in selecting suitable technologies for the job from an early stage in the project this aproach enables otherwise reluctant clients to se the usefulnes of the technologies for their projects multiplex relies on visual comunication tols including modeling and virtual reality in order to demonstrate the benefits of digital technologies regularly updating clients on ipa government construction strategy london ipa ipa proposal for new aproach to building cal for evidence infrastructure and projects authority london ipa badi ochieng nasaj papadaki technological organisational and environmental determinants of smart contracts adoption uk construction sector viewpoint construction management and economics project progres using these same tols as wel as drone fotage of ongoing work helps to bost client trust and increase confidence in the use of inovative technologies for future projects recomendation build transparent long term trust based relationships with clients construction firms should make deliberate eforts to demonstrate the value of using digital technologies and osm for project delivery to clients this requires building relationships based on mutual trust over time through profesional advice and clear and consistent articulation of the potential financial and sustainability gains to be made from using digital technologies and osm being able to demonstrate that the promised benefits and savings were delivered is crucial to maintaining that trust training and skils development initiatives for employes employes ned to be suported to develop the necesary skils and competencies to enable them to engage with digital technologies and osm rather than asuming particular level of digital competency firms ned to establish baseline of individual competencies so that employes can start their skils journey at the right level for them the digital competency scale provided by the citb is god resource for undertaking this task as it helps to identify which groups of employes ned which specific skils and competencies the suply chain sustainability schol also has wide range of programs available for training employes at diferent levels of competencies to complement these bespoke or one to one training which is tailored to individual digital literacy is crucial in adition it is useful to provide al employes with the basic skils for operating any underlying platform prior to introducing aplication software as part of digital transformation programe companies should bear in mind that soft skils training including colaborative skils system thinking and comunication are as fundamental as hard skils industry example kier kier is leading uk construction and infrastructure services company with almost employes ranking second among the uk top construction companies this multi award wining company was also shortlisted for recognition under the category of the best skils training inovation at the building inovation awards as part of their digital competencies training kier provide in house training designed in line with kier digital transformation agenda the training involves regular one to one metings betwen bim cordinators and design and project employes and aims to identify digital learning neds and asign employes to learning sesions that wil provide them with the requisite skils and knowledge about software programes and proceses these sesions are designed to take acount of individual knowledge and skils regular drop in sesions with refreshments encourage eople to get answers to their questions and help overcome any embarasment that might arise when asking questions in more formal seting recomendations upskil employes in the use of new software and adapting to modified proceses upskiling employes is priority for construction companies in the journey from conventional methods of working to the use of digital technologies atention neds to be paid to helping employes adapt to new technology driven proceses and software changes creating oportunities for employes to take the initiative in learning about the use of digital technologies is also critical to this end companies should suport their employes to undertake relevant training courses provided by relevant institutions including the citb british standards institution bsi royal institution of chartered surveyors rics and suply chain sustainability schol provide tailored training based on employe digital competency levels employes ned to be equiped with soft skils and generic and role specific competencies not everyone neds to know everything but al employes should achieve competencies in the use of certain basic digital platforms microsoft teams skype and microsoft ofice

employes to take the initiative when working with new tols technologies or implementing new proceses teams ned to work with software platfor ms that can talk to each other and are interoperable as easy comunication can reduce the likelihod of conflicts and enhance colaboration efective colaboration and comunication using bim are not compatible with traditional methods of organising and sharing information such as physical files and construction firms wil ned to change their systems of data capture storage and sharing of quality data implementing changes to how data is captured shared and

abstract the project explores the posible impacts of digital transformation on journeys to work through the development of city level digital twin cdt prototype that integrates data models and insights from multiple disciplines and sectors the research includes thre work packages empirical investigation of key factors afecting worker choice on place of work fixed workplace work at from home and on travel mode in the cambridge sub region developing digital twin prototype including web based interface for simulating journeys to work and testing two digital transformation scenarios prevalence of teleworking large scale adoption of electric vehicles engaging with local authorities modeling experts and other key stakeholders to colect fedback on the aplication and future development of cdt productive partnership has ben established betwen the local authorities and the project team for the co development of the digital twin prototype the project also colaborates closely with academics at ucl and cambridge key research outputs are discused in detail and series of working propositions are proposed which may guide the future research on cdt city level digital twin experiment for exploring the impacts of digital transformation on journeys to work in the cambridge sub region introduction we are living through the th industrial revolution moving from period of relative data scarcity to an era of digital abundance the sher size of investments and eforts for building smart cities acros the globe has epitomized the inspiration for future beter cities in the digital era in the uk the national infrastructure comision has outlined an ambitious plan of building national digital twin of uk infrastructure which aims to demonstrate uk global leadership in smart infrastructure the digital twin brings together individual infrastructure models and the interdependencies betwen them through federated system thus represents cordinated aproach for planing constructing and managing national infrastructure the potential benefits of the national digital twin are aparent optimising use of resources reducing service disruption increasing resilience and bosting quality of life for citizens but how to materialise such benefits through efective policy making remains big chalenge ahead while the digital twin technology is making great strides in the uk with several large scale pilots under construction exeter bristol quen elizabeth park in london or being considered smart cambridge the varying and changing socio economic and political context of the uk cities implies that the digital twin alone is unlikely to be one size fits al solution to city chalenges for example wh ile congestion has ben regarded as prevailing isue acros major cities there are actualy fewer comuting journeys per person per wek in the uk in than the mid this trend has often ben atributed to wide range of transformations regarding the nature of employment such as more part time work more people working from multiple places teleworking increasing self employment the gig economy etc such behavioural changes are complex and wil have profound implications on how we plan use and manage our future infrastructure however understanding such changes requires an inter disciplinary and colaborative aproach the digital twin has great potential for bridging the disciplinary and profesional gaps by incorporating data and insights from multiple sectors thus fostering stakeholder debates over complex trade ofs the project represents an early trial to adres the research gap on city level digital twins it aims to develop digital twin model prototype for examining the potential impacts of digital transformation on journeys to work in the cambridge sub region the report is organised as folows section introduces the study area section discuses the key research outputs section sumarises the potential contributions to digital built britain through proposing series of propositions for guiding future research overview of the study area the core study area for this study is the cambridgeshire and peterborough combined authority which consists of local authority districts given the relatively large comuting catchment of cambridge the modeling area is expanded to cover the former greater cambridge and greater peterborough lep area which consists of

in terms of the im balance betwen resident and workplace population in the study region se figure cambridge and peterborough are the only two cities in the study area that have more employed workers

below shows that the part time employes and the self employed without employes have ben growing faster than other employment types in the cambridgeshire and peterborough combined authority compared with the number of self employed without employes has grown times and the part time employes have nearly doubled in in particular the self employed without employes who may be closely related to the gig economy se an ever quicker growth during in the study area the ful time employes who acount for of the workforce in have sen steady growth since it can be anticipated that the share of part time workers including both employes and the self employed is likely to raise in the study area suposing the observed trend continues as more people start to engage flexible working flexible working hours working from multiple places it is important to investigate the asociated impacts on the choice of place of work and journeys to work city level digital twin experiment for exploring the impacts of digital transformation on journeys to work in the cambridge sub region figure change of employes and the self employed in the cambridgeshire and peterborough combined authority understanding the choice of place of work our statistical analysis using census microdata for the study region confirms that being self employed either as frelancer or with employes is more likely to work at from home or have no fixed place than being an employe after controling the cros sample diferences on age socio economic status industry of work broad residence location length of working hours posible childcare duty and housing condition measured by number of persons per rom specificaly the positive corelation betwen the age of individual sample and the choice of working at from home indicates propensity for working at from home when workers get old in the study area higher socio economic status would increase the probability of chosing home working it sugests that high skil jobs managerial and profesional are more amenable to working at from home than relatively low skil jobs semi routine and routine low skil jobs are more likely to have no fixed workplace we also find that the choice of home working is subject to the availability of space in the house as the number of persons per rom increases higher ocupancy level the likelihod of working at from home decreases in the study region the interdependence betwen home working and housing provision subject to further tests using up to date data may shed new light on understanding worker choice of place of work sa emulov deniahc

comuters who are pasengers in car the figure also omits other modes of travel motorcycle scoter or moped taxi as by census definition figure mode share and travel volume for comuting by distance band it shows that for distance under km the predominant mode for comuting to cambridge including those comuting within cambridge is bicycle around folowed by walking and driving however the mode share for driving increases sharply from km reaching about for km and striking for km this is acompanied by the quick drop of bicycle mode it is not surprising as cycling over km about min one way for an average sped of km hr on daily basis may become physicaly undesirable les than of comuters use bus for comuning within the km range the share of bus increases from km but is caped around at around km the share of train for comuting remains under for distance under km with spike around km range waterbeach cambridge and increases to about for km newmarket royston cambridge and km ely cambridge given the local policy goal of reducing car dependence and promote sustainable travel the shift from car to bus and other non motor modes has ben the overarching focus in local transport strategy the figure below shows the ratio of mode share betwen bus and car around cambridge the purpose of producing the map is to emphasize the spatial heterogeneity in terms of the mode choice of car and public transit to adres the desirable shift from car to bus the km comuting distance range is selected within which the bus remains feasible substitute to car for comuting purpose for comuters as pasengers in car acount for about of al comuters to cambridge including those comuting within cambridge al other modes acount for about of al comuters to cambridge including those comuting within cambridge the

employment sites on the fringe science park and the biomedical campus the mode ratio betwen bus and car is generaly under indicating les than ten bus comuters by every car comuters the empirical finding sugests that to shift comuters from car to public transit the mobility solutions ned to be more targeted in relation to specific locations and comuting coridors and socio economic background of comuters the spatial and social dimension is very important in policy making without which the behavioral changes expected from policy interventions shift towards public transit are dificult to

turn below scenario teleworking teleworking or remote working represents flexible way of working without comuting to central workplace teleworking enables workers to work from home or other locations for some days of the wek which thus may reduce the overal comuting demand one of the key modeling asumptions pertains to what kinds of employment are amenable to teleworking in the future se table it

about the cpier report city level digital twin experiment for exploring the impacts of digital transformation on journeys to work in the cambridge sub region to test the posible impacts on comuting due to teleworking comparative scenario analysis is conducted we first run the digital twin model to generate baseline scenario for the study region using the asumed employment projection sumarized in table the baseline scenario serves as the basis for comparing the relative changes acros scenarios recal that the proposed digital twin model can predict both the residence location choice and the mode choice in the baseline scenario both the residence location and the mode choices are simulated by the model technicaly the prevalence of teleworking would afect both the residence location choice for reduced overal comuting cost per wek and the mode choice for likely increased flexibility in working hours nonetheles there is no empirical data available for estimating the elasticity of household relocation with respect to the reduced wekly comuting cost we thus do not consider the posible residence relocation and asume that in the teleworking scenario al employed residents remain their original home location as in the baseline scenario the scenario result is shown in figure figure scenario output potential reduction of comuting flow by al modes due to teleworking in cambridge based on the baseline scenario northstowe impington cambourne comberton fulbourn duxford it shows that the posible impact on comuting is not evenly distributed acros the study area the teleworking may reduce the journeys to work both within the city and acros city boundary in particular the comuting flow from cambourne comberton northstowe and impington to cambridge may se significant reduction two policy implications may be drawn from this preliminary impact study of teleworking on comuting first the fast growth of self employed and part time workers in the study area since sugests that flexible working arangement such as teleworking may become prevalent in the study area the posible impact on journeys to work could be significant in magnitude city level digital twin experiment for exploring the impacts of digital tra nsformation on journeys to work in the cambridge sub region which poses new chalenges to transport demand forecast second the prevalence of teleworking may bring radical changes in terms of the relationship betwen work and location on the one hand the emerging co working space is bluring the boundary betwen jobs and workplace teleworkers search for suitable place to work and fil that workspace but not necesarily job on the other hand planers developers architects and employers ned to consider new models of providing and managing workspace hotdesking not simply reducing the florspace per worker but considering the flexibility and adaptability of space and the wider impacts on workers productivity and welfare some caveats should be noted first literature on tele remote working sugests that the reduction of comuting trips may result in the increase of non comuting trips and the total time budget for traveling in fact remains quite stable over time and among population although teleworking may reduce the demand for comuting for certain types of jobs the impact on overal travel demand is not clear second digital technology is likely to be key enabler for teleworking it involves wide range of technology such as cloud platform imersive technology and the underlying physical infrastructure such as fibre broadband mobile conectivity the teleworking scenario in this study does not consider the availability of such technology in specific locations scenario electric vehicles charging demand the design of this scenario is inspired by one particular finding from the workshops and interviews with local authorities replacing the existing combustion engine vehicles with electric vehicles evs is demed as the ultimate solution to air polution as it adreses the rot of the isue however the large scale take up of evs is subject to the capacity of local electricity grid which is already under considerable strain the adenbroke hospital area this scenario thus aims to adres the interdependences betwen the environment transport land use and energy system in local policy making this scenario asumes that al vehicles comuting to cambridge including those comuting within cambridge are evs to simplify the energy simulation we do not diferentiate the types of evs and asume uniform electricity consumption per km traveled by evs kwh per km source dft webtag the electricity charging demand for non comuting use of evs is also not considered the key policy variable in this scenario is the spatial distribution of future housing and employment growth in the study region se figure total of thre alternative spatial development strategies are tested which are in line with the scenario seting in the cpier report se fotnote on page for more information about the cpier report the digital twin model predicts how alternative spatial strate gies may afect the distribution of evs charging demand acros the study region the prediction for the baseline is presented in figure to highlight the posible impact of nudging people in terms of where to charge the evs we further asume that al comuting evs can only be charged at either workplace or home place the results for the densification and the fringe growth are presented in figure and figure respectively hägerstrand what about people in regional science papers in

evs charging scenario densification charging at workplace left vs at home place right figure evs charging scenario fringe growth charging at workplace left vs at home place right city level digital twin experiment for exploring the impacts of digital transformation on journeys to work in the cambridge sub region policy implications of the evs charging scenario are sumarised as folows high level of spatial variance is observed in the distribution of charging demand for comuting evs the further concentration of employment in cambridge as in the densification scenario results in the highest charging demand in cambridge if comuting evs are al charged at workplace upgrading the energy infrastructure in the dense centre of cambridge is likely to be expensive acompanied with severe disruption to local busineses nonetheles the increased electricity demand may be shifted away to other locations in the short term through pro active pricing policy on charging and or parking at workplace as sugested by the comparison betwen charging at workplace and home place in the figures to make it posible it requires beter colaboration betwen transport housing and energy team in local government the feasibility of shirting evs charging demand betwen workplace and home place is les in the fringe growth scenario as more workers live in proximity to their workplace the improved job housing balance on the fringe also indicates reduced average comuting distance compared with the baseline it should be pointed out that the scenario results are rather crude due to the various simplifications in scenario design the purpose of this scenario is thus not to provide an enginering solution for optimizing the distribution of future evs charging demand but to demonstrate the potential of city level digital simulation tols for facilitating cros boundary colaboration in policy making in local government potential contributions to digital built britain inspired by the uk

sumarize series of working propositions regarding the development of city level digital twins which are derived from the cambridge digital twin exercise an early version of these propositions has ben presented on the international conference on smart infrastructure and construction icsic in cambridge it is expected that these propositions wil guide the future research and practice on city level digital twin and thus contribute to digital built britain proposition the upscaling from an enginering digital twin to city level digital twin is not straightforward for city level digital twin aplication to be useful and the asociated discusion to be meaningful key dimensions of the digital twin ned to be articulated pertaining to the purpose boundary context and resolution of the specific digital twin as wel as the interdependences among twin models thre dimensions of such are proposed in figure policy domains stakeholders denote the subject and representation of the digital twin about what and for whom locational context includes the social economic political and geographic background and spatial temporal scale indicates the resolution of the twin model wan et al developing city level digital twin propositions and case study international conference on smart infrastructure and construction icsic january city level digital twin experiment for exploring the impacts of digital transformation on journeys to work in the cambridge sub region figure key dimensions for defining city level digital twin aplication policy domains stakeholders about what for whom digital twin digital twin digital twin locational context spatial temporal scale proposition digital twin development is progresive proces the digital twin and the social system that creates and uses it must co evolve with each this proposition relates to the intelectual relationship betwen the digital twin and the human society on the one hand our existing knowledge about cities and societies defines how wel we could development and use city level digital twin on the other hand artificial inteligence ai may eventualy become comparable to or even surpas human inteligence in terms of knowledge production and decision making in the wake of recent data misuse and privacy breach incidents the cambridge analytica case the co evolving proposition adreses the imperative for harnesing the power of ai through pre emptive measures proposition real time is relative term the temporal scale of the digital twin should reflect the rate of change of the subject in reality the real time feature as in enginering digital twin aplications denotes the low latency in updating the twin model against the reality the transition from manufacturing product as the subject of digital replica to city entails the term real time to be redefined it contests to the simplistic pursuit of high frequency data regardles of the purpose of the digital twin proposition to advance the city level digital twin agenda digital twin aplications should be focused on enabling more frequent and efective fedback lop betwen the twin model stakeholders and the public one major problem of using urban computational models in policy making is the lack or ineficiency of fedback which can manifest itself in various ways model as black box no post analysis validation and the detachment from public engagement from modeling perspective the implication is that the interaction betwen the model and the users is far from perfect even for modeling experts new interface thus neds to be explored which can translate data analytics into cogent naratives targeted to various stakeholders to achieve it modelers may have to think beyond models which is aparently more than technical request proposition to help solving complex policy chalenges realistic use of city level digital twin is to identify system level risks and ineficiencies of policy interventions and to foster cros disciplinary profesional colaboration as oposed to providing singular model based city level digital twin experiment for exploring the impacts of digital transformation on journeys to work in the cambridge sub region optimization system level optimization though being the explicit purpose of some digital twins in the enginering sphere may not be an efective aproach to adres wicked urban problems one of the reasons is that developers of the digital twin given their technical background often do not have enough understanding of the non tec hnical factors election cycles hierarchies of decision making institutional constraints these non technical factors are usualy highly influential but tend to be very dificult to be incorporated in the model model based optimization which does not consider such non technical constraints would have litle meaning it should be noted that these propositions are neither conclusive nor exhaustive it is expected that the propositions could be further tested and expanded through more empirical research conclusions the digital twin technology represents one of the latest technical trends for smartening our cities however the roadmap to develop city national level digital twin is not yet clear this project represents timely efort to explore policy oriented strategy for developing city level digital twin prototype for the cambridge sub region key research outputs are discused and series of propositions are proposed for guiding the future research on city level digital twin the project is nothing but smal step towards the ambition of creating national digital twin for the uk infrastructure it is expected that more and more empirical evidence wil be gathered to establish new body of knowledge for leveraging and regulating the power of digital twins as discused in one of the propositions the development of digital twin is progresive proces where the digital twin and the social system that creates and uses it must co evolve with each much remains to be done

research revealed that the asia pacific apac region witnesed the highest year on year increase in wekly cyberatacks during the first quarter of on average each organisation in apac is hit by atacks per wek why is our region hotbed for cybercrime several factors are at play says mr martin kho principal lecturer consultant digital strategy leadership practice nus is these include rapid digital

invest in cybersecurity at the organisation level while individuals like you and me ned to know how to protect ourselves and our data from threat actors key cybersecurity considerations how can organisations mitigate the risks asociated with digital transformation and improve their security posture martin highlights thre areas risk asesment incident response and recovery and continuous monitoring and testing digital transformation introduces new risks especialy regarding data security and privacy he says organisations must ases these risks and develop cybersecurity strategy to adres them as busineses colect more customer data they have duty of care to make sure these data are managed securely compliance with regulations such as pdpa in singapore and gdpr in europe is crucial but despite best eforts no system is entirely imune to cyber threats organisations ned an incident response plan to quickly and efectively manage incidents when they ocur regular testing and exercising of the plan are esential particularly for regulated sectors like banking and finance on top of that proactive monitoring of it infrastructure is crucial for detecting and responding to threats promptly regular vulnerability asesments and penetration testing help identify and mitigate potential weakneses before atackers exploit them martin ads two ways to do so are through vulnerability asesment where you scan your environment to identify and patch weak spots or penetration testing where you put on the hat of an atacker and try to penetrate your own system aligning cyber security strategy with busines outcomes cybersecurity strategy is not developed in isolation it neds to be crafted to align with the organisation broader busines goals and objectives says martin the strategy translates into an actionable plan that enhances the organisation cybersecurity posture and resilience at this stage the cybersecurity strategy should focus on overarching goals and outcomes and be technology agnostic he ads typicaly cybersecurity strategy spans thre to five years but regular review is crucial idealy on an anual basis this is because the cybersecurity landscape is dynamic with new threats constantly emerging regular review ensures that the strategy remains relevant and efective in adresing evolving threats on the organisation level cybersecurity strategy the secret to securing your

without adequate funding it is chalenging to implement the initiatives outlined in the strategy efectively he explains cybersecurity neds to be powered by skiled talent last but not least robust

customers busines capabilities and people and leadership isues this course covers the customer and busines dimensions the customer dimension loks at how desirable customer value proposition cvp is derived from the folowing leading digital transformation here are the most important skils it leaders ned to have leading digital transformation here are the most important skils it leaders ned to have by damien cumings chief digital strategy and leadership practice the covid pandemic has acelerated digital transformation in al sectors and regions by several years and as we enter the new normal this unprecedented change is reshaping southeast asia in exciting ways the vibrant region is home to boming startup sector with rising consumer clases and demographic advantage on its side over percent of the world youths live in the asia pacific apac and southeast asia is leading the region digital transformation with milion people becoming digital consumers since from the rise of comerce and fintech to hybrid work taking center stage as economies reopen the region holds imense oportunities but despite having young population ready to embrace the online platforms and social media not everyone is keping up with the changes fast enough huge digital skils gap is weighing down on al sectors around the world given the intense demands of new software and infrastructures as wel as new ways of working regional research report by amazon web services aws and consulting firm alphabeta revealed that by the average worker in apac wil ned to learn seven new digital skils the number of apac workers requiring digital skils wil grow over five fold which means that acros southeast asia and singapore specificaly bilion digital training wil be required acros the entire workforce what these mean for busineses is that there is and wil be constant change those in leadership roles wil ned to have the right skils not necesarily technical ones to deal with the disruptions ahead in order to ensure their organisation is future ready seting your organisation up to be part of the percent the reality is many digital transformation programes fail study by boston consulting group arived at an alarming conclusion percent of digital transformations fail faling short of their objectives and often producing profound consequences to champion sucesful digital transformation project leaders ned to be equiped with these five critical skils digital leadership most of the time what mising in an organisation digital transformation roadmap is clear set of goals that diferentiates the project from standard digitisation it not about giving everyone aces to zom so they can work from home during pandemic rather an example of digital transformation would be to fundamentaly shift from physical retail model to comerce to reach more consumers who would otherwise not visit the store an important yet often overloked aspect of digital leadership is to ensure that the entire organisation is digitaly upskiled no mater what industr you are in busineses are becoming digital busineses and this means that everyone neds to be digitaly literate from the frontline intern al the way up to the ceo everyone neds to be on the same page in terms of the ease of working with technological tols for productivity colaboration and leveraging data to enhance their work overcoming resistance and managing change despite the promises of new technologies in terms of eficiency ease of use and beter customer experience many digital transformations fail due to employes unwilingnes to change and por organizational practices to overcome this resistance there are thre that can help comunication colaboration and comitment sucesful leaders talk about the why rather than focusing on the what they are the ones who are down there in the trenches trying to understand the work of their employes and aplying empathy while comunicating the reasons behind the changes that are hapening this turns the digital transformation into colaborative proces and builds sense of purpose and belonging within the team pointing them towards an aligned direction comitment is about walking the talk and taking the lead if you re implementing new tech tol be the role model use it yourself and champion it excelent people management god team members have flow on efect inside an organisation they create virtuous circles which have significant tangible impact on the team that they work in and help to create conducive productive environment to work in gogle spent years studying how efective teams lok like and how to build high performing teams what they realised ultimately is that it doesn realy mater who on the team rather it about how the team works together the most critical element is that leaders ned to develop an environment of leading digital transformation here are the most important skils it leaders ned to have psychological safety this could be anything from the ability to take risks to share controversial ideas and have debate or dialogue and to know that it not going to be carer threatening if you don agre with your manager such an environment wil help employes to fel that the work they do actualy maters become champion of data study by hfs research found that percent of busines executives do not have high level of trust in their data and percent do not consider their data architecture to be world clas this is worying as data literacy the ability to read understand and comunicate data in context is important no mater where an organisation is on its digital transformation journey the advice is to start with basic digital training for al employes just to ensure everyone is singing from he same songbok having base level of digital training wil ensure that they can refer back and use it as basis for comon language when discusing data related proceses self awarenes and reflection while percent of people believe they re self aware in reality just percent to percent actualy are and why does this trait mater on personal level self awarenes helps you understand and cope with stres at work it can help you match your skil sets beter colaborate more eficiently and enhance your relationships as it leads to greater level of openes and comunication one way to improve your self awarenes is to gather fedback not just through oficial apraisal systems but also to check in with your team and even engage friends or coleagues for honest fedback no leader is an island ultimately the key takeaway from the five skils above is that sucesful digital transformation takes vilage it not posible for an it leader to implement changes alone what you ned is organisation wide buy in and colaboration acros departments the chalenge is to engage every stakeholder from the frontline staf al the way through the level executives and board members and take them along that journey even if change is dificult help them to understand that they have personal and organisational impact in the work that they are doing and empower them to se the eventual positive outcome of this digital transition and they be your best alies in taking digital

paper we adres the folowing research introducti on question what are the main resources and competencies understod as proces in which organizations use being mobilized by brazilian csos for distinctive busines technology to radicaly improve their performance or reach models to answer it we present the theoretical background digital transformation dt has gained prominence among used to lay our analysis in section folowed by definition scholars and practitioners in recent years diferent from for carsharing and its past and recent developments worldwide digitization which started with the first mainframes in the and in brazil in section the method aplied to conduct the dt brought profound implications to how study is presented in section iv results and an in depth busineses create deliver and capture value tensioning discusion are present in sections and vi finaly we established architectures and forcing busines model synthesize our main findings in section vi experimentation for example aple ibm and general electric are mobilizing technologies like cloud theoretical background computing the internet of things artificial inteligence and machine learning to design new services that could beter the busines model concept adres customers neds and alow new revenue streams practitioners and scholars have discused the busines model bm concept since the late during the emerging scholars have explored the dt phenomenon throughout digital era despite its already longstanding debate many sectors such as banking health services there is no single definition of bm some authors define it manufactured gods media and publishing industries as being logic description history comerce and transportation in the system and even an architecture of later new busines models bms under dt are gaining rom how an enterprise competes in given market the same can among other modes of transportation ride hailing services be said regarding bm building blocks acording to their uber cabify and lyft bike sharing grin nice research objectives diferent authors bring diferent ride and yelow and carsharing sharenow zipcar components under bm umbrela and turo are often viewed by policy

manuscript received jan acepted mar procedings of picmet technology management and leadership in digital transformation loking ahead to post covid era to create value through the exploitation of

the new the busines finaly governance is derived from what type of busineses formed relied extensively on xerox hierarchy the previously elements are submited underexploited technologies while some spin ofs designed very distinct bms to operate on the market others stick to later the same authors in reference build upon their xerox logic previous discusions sugesting another definition we conceptualize firm busines model as system of under this technological point of view defines bm as interdependent activities that transcends the focal firm and revenue architecture that dictates how firm exploits the spans its boundaries the activity system perspective latent value of given technology therefore bms is how considers that given firm conducts particular set of firm wil capture the value created by technological inovation activities derived from existing resources and competencies under specific structure and governance activities are linked tece uses the same term architecture to describe in each structure with precise order and distribution among bm but the author goes further than tece revisits agents meanwhile activities are governed through contracts netflix example the company thrived upon its main the market or the firm itself competitor blockbuster through combination of references and on the other hand describe bm technological inovation and busines model inovation as the underlying logic of how given firm creates delivers avoiding the usual home video rental bm netflix reached and captures value reference sugests that bm and leaner cost structure and beter customer value propositions strategy are conected with the former being partial first netflix structured its bm to provide home video rental by materialization of the later mailing so it did not rely upon physical stores to reach its target customers ordered online and paid monthly to receive as practitioner publication provides definition fixed number of dvds directly in their homes the

to avoid driving to physical enterprises work so an eficient bm comprehends stores and waiting in line to rent single dvd elements that compose coherent story in the big picture and must make sense in their interelations with each other of course technological novelty laid the ground for this yielding profit to the firm new level of convenience to alow service oferings via its website the company had developed new technology that reference also explores the diferences betwen bm alowed customers to list their orders online the new and strategy while the bm is story that explains how the technology served as basis to netflix employ its bm but it firm operates in given market it does not consider the would mean nothing alone it aded other bm elements such competition in this sense the bm is static understanding of as the subscription model and the online customer chanel to how the firm plays the game on the other hand strategy is compose competitive value propositions thus tece dynamic consideration of how firm operates when it runs into defines bm as being the architecture of the value creation competitors delivery and capture mechanisms employed by the firm notwithstanding the authors contributions to bm literature we ned to cement our analysis on single definition in this likewise reference the understanding of bm as an mater presents co citation analysis involving the bm architecture evokes magreta definition of bm as story literature this analysis presumes that as two works are cited it implies that both interelations among elements and their together the greater are the chances of both being corelated in final disposition maters to the big picture at the same time in content thus being able to build clusters from considering it as being an architecture of the value creation bibliographic data with co cited papers the authors in use delivery and capture and not as revenue architecture the maping and cluster analysis to determine the most influential author also implies that the bm can be the source of value publications they find that both works of and are itself therefore this definition gives rom to the widely linked to considerable number of clusters in other words discused technological inovation and busines model even though diferent aproaches and perspectives are being inovation developed regarding bms both articles play an esential role in the literature providing theoretical basis to their discusions carsharing past and recent developments in the authors revisit the xerox case and its carsharing can be understod as service that provides

observable in brazil since multiple building upon the erstwhile archetypes the authors gathered csos mainly startups fluctuated in the activity some data from csos in europe america asia and oceania ceos stated the same dificulties as their international they identified subtle diferences among operators within the counterparts at the same time they also pointed out other same archetype which alowed them to design taxonomy that bariers such as lack of interested investors absence of proper could beter ilustrate the reality of carsharing operations regulation and suport from the public sector and weak demand some csos under roundtrip for example were mobilizing heterogeneous flet with multiple vehicle types carsharing busines models while others had single vehicle type operators under one way bms could often designate specific locations to their operators provide carsharing services through various bms shared cars stations or even alow customers to pick up and reference sugest that carsharing return the vehicles anywhere near their destinations fre bms can be divided into non profit coperatives floating since they respected local transit law among busines to consumer roundtrip busines to consumer operators the authors identified two main variations one that point to point and per to per ofered manual aces to vehicles as described by the first archetype refers to

we considered the folowing criteria the organization should be directly involved in ofering procedings of picmet technology management and leadership in digital transformation loking ahead to post

candidates for case studies were first obtained brazil beta was the only cso operating under bm that from crunchbase an online database that gathers information remane and coleagues had not discused instead it focuses from research institutions public agencies investors and on corporative carsharing busines to busines or an media companies regarding companies around the world the in depth exposition for each case is presented next user can search for specific company and activity and filter by location and size of the organization in this sense we table enterprises considered for the study searched for carsharing and filtered by country brazil which cso location busines model yielded results each of them was checked using the criteria alfa sao paulo sp brazil manual aces resulting in exclusions thre enterprises did not maintain website thre did not present their direct involvement in corporative carsharing or carsharing operations and thre were defunct by beta sao paulo sp brazil busines to busines the second source for our case selection was journalistic one way documentation from local lay media searches were conducted gama recife pe brazil stationary betwen june and

nevertheles thre refused or could not answer our through its digital platform that can be acesed via invitation in time for data analysis the remaining csos smartphone aplication in the first two years the organization named alfa beta gama and delta were operating under was limited to sao paulo state but rapidly expanded to the diferent bms and were sucesfuly incorporated in this study national level in research protocols were defined under semi structured in terms of value creation alfa relies on the twofold value interviews with ceos ctos and other managers and team proposition on the one hand it ofers facilitated car rental leaders from the carsharing operators the content of the services to mobility consumers user certification vehicle interviews was based upon definition for bm that is an boking payment transaction validation vehicle architecture of the value creation delivery and capture documentation and insurance services are al conducted via therefore questions were formulated to alfa platform with only key handover requiring users to determine how the selected csos created delivered and met physicaly on the other hand alfa apeals to car owners captured value in the brazilian market in ofering means to generate aditional revenue via idle aces to the csos were limited each enterprise asets that is it guarantes secure transactions to car owners alowed only one interviewe to participate in presential and during carsharing remote interactions we used secondary data gathered from the since alfa busines proces stil requires vehicle boking journalistic material acumulated during the case selection and certain level of premeditation to demand the service its phase and information presented in csos websites to value propositions target users interested in carsharing for guarante data triangulation more extended periods than on demand mobility services the data analysis was conducted utilizing the content analysis interviewe declared that most vehicle bokings ocured for technique presented by this method alows the researcher holidays and wekends at the same time alfa tarif model to organize non structured data into constructs conceived also is projected to sustain this segment since it is based on specialy for data analysis folowing the analysis made by daily rates rather than hourly or by the minute rates as in ride remane and coleagues we were able to define some hailing and in some operators alfa frequently constructs that could portrait the diferent bm pilars ofered holiday and wekend bundles to foster transactions in mentioned by tece definition we considered value its platform proposition and marke segment as proper constructs for value in sum the primary resource for alfa is its digital platform creation value delivery is directly related to which resources unlike the other cases presented alfa is entirely dependent on competencies and supliers are mobilized to sustain the firm its virtual comunity to create deliver and capture value value proposition and reach its target market finaly value thus competencies related to software development backend capture was represented by the enterprise revenue streams frontend and user experience are esential to the busines when ofering carsharing services the results obtained from data analysis were iteratively compared with existing academic although its leaner aproach to carsharing alfa faces literature regarding carsharing bms our study reached closure diferent chalenges which do not involve investment and under theoretical saturation evidenced in section vi procedings of picmet technology management and leadership in digital transformation loking ahead to post covid era maintenance of an owned car flet and dedicated parking beta spaces first the firm must guarante secure transactions beta is also startup located in sao paulo that initiated betwen users the firm validates mobility consumers for car operations in however unlike alfa beta started as owners checking whether they have driver license and one way stationary operator held by luxury car rental criminal record nonetheles car owners must present company betwen and beta owned vehicles documents certifying their ownership over the vehicle and electric vehicles evs and combustion vehicles al whether they maintain insurance services themselves although compact sizes models beta held no private parking spaces alfa already ofers insurance coverage to al vehicles registered instead it alocated its vehicles near parks and pub houses in in its platform the required individual insurance certifies that public parking spaces customers were required to download the vehicle fulfils the minimum security requirements for beta smartphone aplication to aces its vehicles remotely sharing hence alfa retains organizational structures the software was developed by third party and used by beta specialized in anti fraud techniques to inhibit misapropriation and fre rider behavior this bm design was financialy unsustainable in any case many vehicles were lost to theft vandalism flods and other another chalenge alfa faces is significant imbalance damages with no specific parking spaces and proper betwen car owners and mobility consumers at the moment of monitoring mechanisms at the end of the parent the interview the organization held around users with organization sold beta to another society that rapidly redesigns only car owners such disproportion directly hinders its bm to acomodate corpora tive carsharing the new alfa virtual comunity expansion due to the lack of management sought partnerships with smal car rental consistent suply of registered cars available on its platform companies and dealership stores to compose beta car flet the interviewe revealed that

promoting social development through digital transformation in the world of work in post pandemic environment is as chalenging as it is promising after al oportunities often arise in unpredictable moments of crisis and consequently unexpected changes public libraries are at the center of these changes and oportunities in the networked information century this phenomenon requires information profesionals to take proactive aproach to inovation inovation is comprehensive and transversal so we adopt as conception of inovation the development of new products and services with inovative methods and actions such as for example citizen labs ideas incubators virtual learning environments creative spaces and participatory environments enabling aces to online colections and digital information these inovations which when put into practice bring improvement to service product or proces existing in library contributing to make the lives of people who use the products and services ofered by it easier the maping of scientific literature to identify the evolution of the theme inovation in the field of information science caried out by gabriel júnior sousa and silva states that it is very dificult to have definition of inovation that mets al areas and contexts in the ic area inovation is very much characterized as proces of improvement or transformation of proceses and services in ci the concept of inovation as development or improvement of proceses and services ocurs mainly with the insertion or updating of new technologies and also transformations and modifications in management proceses this type of inovation in existing proceses is always thought of to met the demands of specific group of users of information services for some types of institutions that ofer information services inovation in services and products ofered becomes more dificult proces due to the aforementioned costs necesary for the efective implementation of new services gabriel junior sousa and silva discus two types of libraries very comon in brazil the public library and the university library about the first the authors state that it has enormous potential for inovation as from the information and comunication technologies icts because they enable beter interaction betwen users products and services favoring autonomy in tasks related to the services ofered by the library however it is pointed out as the main chalenge the fundraising for the apropriate investment in these technologies given the reality of public libraries in the country notoriously known as precarious from the point of view of economic investment from public policies in relation to the second the authors point out as barier the lack of knowledge for the library maintainers of the importance of inovation to generate value because they perceive it as conventional space gabriel junior sousa and silva point out that the concept of inovation in university library should also be asociated with the development and improvement of products and services related to scientific comunication since large part of its public is made up of researchers and students who ned scientific information to cary out their activities and develop their research it is important to mention that both in the study by gabriel júnior sousa and silva the most updated scientific maping on the theme inovation in the ic field and in al the scientific literature investigated as from the research that originated the present article there is no aproach on inovation in libraries of federal institutes which curently in brazil play an educational role in the public sector in more comprehensive way than university libraries for serving users linked to the secondary technical and higher education level and for being present in widely distributed maner throughout the national teritory this gap begins rdbci campinas sp to be filed with this article the first of series of publications that intends to adres the isue with the intent of dev eloping it in the scientific and profesional field with view to both the public educational library and the librarians work beyond the library in other spaces suitable for their work in inovation ecosystems during the pandemic period betwen the years and profesionals from various fields learned new lesons about the most diverse isues that interfere with lifestyles and ways of life as we know them this was landmark of significant changes including changes in the world of work and employment among several the isue of changes in the way of life at work especialy the future of remote work and the role of public educational libraries in this dynamic context in brazil interested the present study during enancib the authors of the present article proposed that these are libraries that suport with info educational actions the teaching research and extension practices developed by public educational institutions whose function is educational and their nature is public conceptualy from the perspective of their organizational identity public educational libraries were defined as information units with priority educational purpose and of public nature which met the information neds of both the academic public at al levels of teaching neds and skils and the technical administrative public and the comunity in general through info educational actions the colection of such institutions can be made up of works that are multicultural extracuricular and linked to the lifelong learning proces covering al age groups without distinction the libraries of the federal institutes are an example of this type of information unit in brazil however this does not exclude other libraries to identify themselves in this organizational identity being necesary to depen the theme in future studies two points constitute the starting point that inspired this research first the observation of the recent transformations that have ocured in the working environments of the comunities to which the authors of this article are linked caried out during doctoral research second the contemporary reflection woven by an experienced north american profesor about the inovation that has emerged over time in public libraries author of many boks and articles about the policymaking proces and how to improve the management of public organizations steve kelman profesor of public administration at harvard university published on august in the traditional and renowned american blog about federal public administration fcw federal computer wek an article entitled in its translation public libraries and government inovation this article is the focal point of the reflection that originated the present research and discusion it is usual that at the core of discusions on public information policies in the field of information science ic in brazil convergence is sought in an interdiscipl inary way betwen what is said in the scientific literature of the administration field and public administration with the ic literature itself and librarianship in numerous instances however recently the debate on sustainable development urban infrastructure and smart cities has gained notoriety and broadened the interdisciplinary range of isues investigated in this scientific field this ocurs due to the evidencing of the urgency in solving and dealing with climate isues for human survival on planet earth and its unfolding which include rethinking the quality of life at work and the ned for presence in diverse situations and environments it has ben trend therefore that profesionals and researchers from other fields of knowledge with emphasis in this discusion on the field of architecture and urbanism become interested in public libraries and their social function in urban spaces historicaly there is an evolution in the apreciation of libraries as civic spaces beyond the idea of exclusive spaces for the promotion of reading and boks defended throughout the th century as places primarily for study and research kelman mentions in his article his satisfaction in recently coming acros the article by liz mcormick sumer urban scholar at new urban mechanics in boston usa rdbci campinas sp who works on management inovations for the city the article titled in translation the radical potential of libraries mentions new ways of library use folowing the pandemic and was published on the city of boston institutional blog specificaly on the page of the mayor ofice of new urban mechanics which is kind of research and development laboratory in boston and also serves as civic incubator for ideas within the city government in europe there has ben lot of talk about the implementation of distributed citizen labs in public libraries initiatives such as the recent ofer of the course laboratorios ciudadanos distribuidos available at for librarians and profesionals from brazil in the distance learning modality promoted by the ministry of culture and sports of spain through the general direction of boks and reading promotion demonstrates the importance of the theme and of the insertion of libraries in the context of citizen inovation diego garcia cordinator of the libraries laboratories project of the mentioned spanish ministry highlighted at the begining of the course through spech broadcast on the youtube platform on april th the importance of reinforcing the role of libraries as meting and colaborative learning spaces where the promotion of democratic values is guaranted distributed citizen labs conceptualy can be understod in broader and more complete way from the perspective of social researcher lorena ruiz diseminated within the first module of the course promoted by the ministry of culture and sport of spain divided into six aspects namely chart distributed citizen labs defined in aspects aspect conceptual perspective first the citizen lab is new form of institution one in which openes acesibility and re apropriability predominate in citizen lab people can make proposals and thus become producers of their own or other people ideas rather than consumers of something predetermined by the institution second citizen lab is meting space for diferent actors to colaborate on the development of shared idea third participation in citizen lab is its conection to its closest environment regarding this aspect it is about valuing the culture of proximity prioritizing the meting and coperation betwen diferent actors linked to the same context neighborhod city an organization etc the laboratory is therefore tol for listening and observing what hapens in these contexts trying to identify the comunity neds desires resources and strengths that can be put into action to develop colective ideas fourth the laboratory works in specific way from the logic of experimentation and prototyping this is one of the most characteristic and relevant features of the proposal of citizen laboratory because it implies prioritizing the proces over the result acepting uncertainty and suporting it colectively and relating directly with eror understanding it as another learning resource experimentation due to its open provisional and even playful nature alows the diverse knowledge of al participants to be brought together and thus promotes coperation and the creation of bonds particularly of trust and reciprocity fifth the articulation of diverse actors around the development of comon idea generates large volume of knowledge citizen lab is not only space in which this production of knowledge is posible but also tol so that the knowledge generated continues to circulate after the lab is over and can be useful in other contexts to achieve this we work from the principles of fre culture fredom to copy distribute modify and improve other people creations documenting the work done in the development of each idea sixth and last the conceptual positioning and the main characteristics we have indicated respond to the fundamental purpose of citizen lab to create comunities of learning and practice these comunities are intended to be spaces to colectively test forms of self management knowledge production and coexistence because in laboratory people participate who for the most part do not know each other and have not chosen to work together and therefore it is necesary to establish learning relationship with others al this with the aim of improving the conditions of rdbci campinas sp coexistence in our neighborhods our cities or our instit utions in short in those places that are close and meaningful to those who inhabit them source chart organized based on the conceptual perspective of lorena ruiz the purpose of the distributed citizen labs acording to ruiz perspective evidenced in the sixth aspect matches the action science method almeida peruchi freire in which it is used the creation of learning comunities caled research comunity in the context of aplication of the scientific method being this critical for obtaining results thinking about the posibility of convergence betwen work agenda in the library and research agenda with group of researchers linked to the library for inovation it is infered that the implementation and or the development of citizen labs distributed in libraries can be part of the methodological strategy for socialization of information fostering the generation of new knowledge development of actions for information competence and for digital competencies in line with the asumption of the social responsibility of information science acording to mcormick libraries have served since the period of the industrial revolution as welcoming point for newly arived imigrants to learn engage and gain suport in their quest for american citizenship other posibilities are noted by kelman from other reports namely recreational use of the library by tenagers after schol hours use of computers and the internet in the library to resolve legal maters and use of the library to entertain children with storyteling historicaly in brazil the library spaces have always ben used in various recreational and formative ways beyond the storage of the bibliographic colection during the pandemic these spaces were physicaly limited making it imposible for people to atend exhibitions lectures training sesions clases and other cultural and educational activities that have always ben posible in library environments information and education services have migrated to virtual learning environments with this reading and comunication habits and practices including the ways of learning were even if temporarily modified to adapt to the restrictions of the pandemic period and the proper continuity of the activities the pandemic period was not the first historical moment that demanded inovation from libraries while in the united states of america libraries were important in welcoming imigrants since the industrial revolution in brazil libraries were and stil are welcoming places for people in conditions of social and economic vulnerability in the post pandemic context without restrictions of physical presence in the library environment it may return to its normal performance but probably having to inovate before the changes in the informational behavior of people which was influenced by the pandemic period certainly new demands wil emerge regardin the ofer of products and services within the hybridism of curent times given this observation kelman asks what wil hapen after libraries are reopened in safer more vacinated world mcormick is also concerned about this future of the library in the post pandemic context and reports on the development of work betwen his ofice the boston public library and the city department of the environment in which they are experimenting with developing two overlaping ideas namely how can libraries evolve into remote workspaces and serve the comunity by playing critical role in heat resilience as boston gets hoter such question emerges after year of closing physical aces to libraries during the pandemic period the work developed by mcormick makes it posible to note that urban climate resilience is one of the contemporary environmental isues where the library can efectively contribute as we wil se in the discusion presented in this paper starting in the rdbci campinas sp second section given the above our research question tok therefore the folowing contour how can public educational libraries in brazil evolve into remote workspaces and serve the diverse comunities of profesionals who work and comunicate in networks the objective of this article was to discus the evolution of public educational libraries into remote workspaces to serve comunity of profesionals who work and comunicate in network one of the most relevant points that interested the research was to know the posibilities of inovation in the public sector through remote work and the role of public educational libraries in this context from the perspective of information science methodological procedures of the research methodologicaly the research is characterized as exploratory of qualitative aproach developed through bibliographic research and elaborated from ongoing doctoral research which makes use of the science action method as technique the research uses reflection in action to obtain scientific evidence and analyze data that culminates in the formulation of proposals relevant to the scientific and profesional context we compared the data on the reality of north american public libraries obtained by bibliographic colection based on the reports of researchers and librarians working in this context with the brazilian reality this comparison resulted in the production of reflection focused on the performance of the libraries of the federal institutes clasified by the authors of this study as public educational libraries in pionering way in the field of information science in brazil chloé valdary enchantment theory is aplied as strategy of methodological aproach to produce critical reflection about inovation in the public sector emphasizing the subjectivity inherent to human relations at work statistical data from recent surveys by the institute or aplied economic research ipea and the brazilian institute of geography and statistics ibge were also consulted to suport this reflective study with evidence the reflection presented in the folowing sections was structured in thre parts which adres the triad inovation remote work and public educational libraries in theoretical corelation with the posibilities of scientific and profesional action based on the purpose of highlighting necesary debate in the field of information science in the st century specificaly such debate subsidizes the evolution of studies on public information policies in libraries and their social implications in brazil the present study was caried out with the suport of two research groups the result of an inter institutional partnership betwen the research group on project management in education science information and technology projecit from the instituto federal da paraíba ifpb and the research group comunication networks and information policies from the universidade federal do rio de janeiro ufrj part of the data obtained in the present investigation is also the result of doctoral research in progres at the graduate program in information science pgci at the federal university of paraíba ufpb the present article therefore is the result of colaborative and integrative work in the scientific comunity where to start thinking about inovation through remote work to get to the answer to the question that gives this section its title we start from kelman perception of inovation in american public libraries when discusing specificaly the public library contributions to urban climate resilience in boston based on the work developed by mcormick highlighting that during the pandemic the library system implemented fre outdor wi fi spaces at locations while branches were closed providing secure outdor internet aces the libraries created rdbci campinas sp six shaded work areas to make the fre wi fi easier to aces and more fun to use they have set up picnic tables an outdor café and misting tents outside the libraries as wel some of which have already ben set up as places to aleviate borowing requests although kelman is not sure why so much inovation has emerged over time in american public libraries while some other government organizations themselves remain tied to conventional practices he points to it being due to the general lack of political controversy surounding public libraries the researcher notes that usualy government inovation arises from crises and threats but that it is diferent with libraries what drives inovation in libraries is their organizational security which fosters the confidence and self confidence of inovators this may be favorable and preponderant factor for inovators to find in the library favorable space for creativity and inovation not only in the united states but also in brazil this point is no diferent from the brazilian reality as we have observed in recent decades however when it comes to inovation in public libraries it is not quite like that for it is complex isue coroborating with kelman we infer that the reality of these information units sugests that more organizational security favors the creation of space for inovators to aproach change with confidence and self confidence both in the united states and in what we can estimate in brazil from the evidence colected mcormick makes us reflect that in times of instability around the world where trust in public institutions has diminished and continues to be threatened public libraries remain highly trusted public entities she corelates this trustworthines given to the library to public from al neighborhods various age groups and generaly by diverse audience she concludes her article by mentioning that despite the gradual replacement of physical records of knowledge by the world of digital information the role of libraries remains more important than ever this position coming from profesional from another area outside the field of librarianship and information science is critical to validate and legitimize the discourse of librarians who fight for more investment and beter working conditions to ofer new and beter services and that has often ben discredited by public managers in one of the recent publications of the federal council of librarianship herera librarian of the public library of the city of san francisco in the united states justifies the relevance of inovation in libraries highlighting that today and in the future libraries must constantly reinvent themselves we can remain loyal to our core mision of providing aces to information and promoting reading however we ned to re examine the traditional model to shift the focus more toward bringing the library to the people this means that we ned to reshape service models to one that is more proactive in comunity outreach and to ofer services that target the user we also ned to make our libraries more acesible as comunity spaces for education and civic engagement now is the time to reinvent the way we do our work librarians have remarkable skil sets to help build comunity teach the new knowledge and redefine our public libraries as learning and knowledge centers of the st century that wil help solidify the information digital and social divide data from the survey conducted by the national system of public libraries indicate that there are public libraries throughout the brazilian teritory considering the sum of municipal district state and federal libraries which would ofer an aproximate average of one public library for every inhabitants snbp there is no disclosure of separate data betwen levels of gov ernment despite this the brazilian institute of geography and statistics ibge released in data from the municipal basic information survey munic which pointed to reduction in the number of municipalities with public libraries by over four year interval in the period from to it is asumed therefore from the reports and the observed data that there is posibility of greater stability within state and federal libraries compared to the municipal rdbci campinas sp reality this may vary acording to the economic conditions of each municipality after al there are exceptions and the case of são paulo is one of them considered one of the municipalities that stand out in the valorization and quality of public libraries such as the mário de andrade library which is municipal and the award wining vila lobos park library which is statewide in brazil data from the brazilian institute of geography and statistics ibge in already pointed out record numbers of remote work in the home ofice format even before the covid pandemic the number reached milion brazilians working in this condition in the mentioned year ibge points out that at the time the home ofice work regime became an alternative to circumvent unemployment disclosing the data silveira highlights that acording to ibge the home ofice coresponded to of al employed workers in the country excluding public sector employes and domestic workers compared to when the historical series of the survey began this contingent increased by the home ofice highlighted the ibge fel betwen and grew in and fel again by in betwen and it grew by góes martins and nascimento published through the institute for aplied economic research ipea conjuncture leter in the first half of which presents oficial government statistical data on remote work in brazil based on the year such data was also published by agência brasil public news agency of the federal government which confirms its relevance for governmental decision making proceses in brazil serving as basis also to compose the evidence of studies and scientific research on the subject this survey pointed out that there was decrease in the number of home ofice workers in the month of november however the number remains much higher than the milion pointed out by the ibge in being registered aproximately milion in the recent ipea survey brasil the recorded drop is natural considering the proximity of the pandemic control observed from the advancement in safety protocols and vacination and gradual return to normality what is curently raising questions especialy in the field of public policies which also interests information science in terms of information policies is the permanence and or transf er of in person activities to the remote work format exclusively or as hybrid the advantages and disadvantages of this migration and the conditions of viability and permanence of this work model the most recent fact in the post pandemic brazilian context which contributes to inovation in the public service is the publication of decre of may which regulates telework and productivity control in the federal public service under the executive branch the greatest inovation provided by the decre consists in the autonomy for the top directors of the entities of the indirect federal public administration which includes federal public autarchies and foundations to authorize the implementation of the management and performance program pgd which was previously restricted to the ministers of state the untying favors the reduction of bureaucracy in the implementation of the program the normative act improves both the management of results of public agencies and agents and the rules related to telework with this telework wil now be posible on part time or ful time basis in federal institutes and universities this government inovation in brazil was posible due to the sucesful experience with remote work during the covid pandemic in an increasingly digital reality it has become evident to public managers the viability of telecomuting in the public sector the measure can contribute to the reduction of costs of the public machine can favor the cultural change of time and atendance control by controling results and the quality of public services and can also result in higher quality of life for federal civil servants beter productivity and serve as an example for governments at the municipal rdbci campinas sp and state levels to rethink the form of work adopted without compromising the eficiency of public power and encouraging profesional performance in acordance with the objectives of sustainable development the evidence of inovation through remote work and the corelation with libraries have ben noticed in scientific works in the field of information science we highlight the increasing aproaches about coworking and other inovative spaces chart in the molds of the present research structured from bibliographic research and with qualitative aproach the study by moyses mont alvão and zatar is one of the examples of recent scientific publication that points out these inovative spaces in libraries the spaces noted in the research are maker spaces learning comons and coworking spaces which acording to the researchers make the library more active colaborative creative and inovative which difers from traditional models that emphasize the consumption of knowledge moyses mont alvão zatar chart inovative library spaces these are spaces qualified to function as incubators of ideas in the most diverse areas which favor creativity experimentation and entrepreneurship in them makerspaces comunity spirit and colaboration are stimulated and technologies and tols are made available to create individual and colective projects these are spaces that are conducive to colaborative learning they consist of learning comons meting space to discus projects and hold metings they are created as an alternative to clasroms informal learning environments these are spaces that have the objective of sharing the physical structure furniture rental costs and comercial adres which alows an environment conducive to coworking the exchange of experiences the sharing of knowledge the participation in events and training programs source chart organized based on research by moyses mont alvão and zatar regarding the exemplification of these spaces we have that maker spaces in brazil as mentioned by moyses mont alvão and zatar are present in schol libraries and also in public libraries the example of initiatives such as in the vila lobos park library bvl that hold maker workshops that teach diferent activities such as bok production robotics home maintenance with focus on diferent user profiles also has an inclusive and acesible environment with several asistive technology devices such as page fliper ergonomic table autonomous reader audio player ruler rail adapted keyboard and mouse computers with scren reader adapted mouse and keyboard has already ben indicated as one of the best in the world for its iluminated environment spaciousnes and democratic space it has also ben clasified as an active library whose architecture itself favors the reader experience besides stimulating and facilitating activities of multiple natures moyses mont alvão and zatar cite the são paulo library another state public library as an example of learning comons it was conceived to be bold space and ofer comfort autonomy and atention to users sen as central elements of the library it ocupies an area of square meters to met the neds of diferent user profiles it has technological resources and makes microcomputers wireles and self service terminals available it was inspired by the santiago library in chile and was nominated in as one of the best in the world the concepts are very similar within colaborative space proposal we can afirm that in some libraries there is the presence of two or more of these spaces in the research by moyses mont alvão and zatar the researchers again point to the parque vila rdbci campinas sp lobos library bvl of the state of são paulo sp this time to make mention of the coworking space it contains in bvl opened coworking space on the second flor of the library which coresponds to shared workrom with infrastructure an wi fi network for use by micro and smal companies startups or people with projects or ventures in development the projects selected through public notice can use the rom fre of charge for ten months in return they must ofer workshops or seminars in the project specialty for of the public al these inovative spaces converge towards the idea of library that aims to be center of socialization and conviviality moyses mont alvão zatar libraries in the st century are moving toward being spaces with greater interactivity intense colaboration and more fruitful and complex relationships this spirit of welcoming and inclusion that has always ben present in libraries is acentuated as the social dynamics of digital transformation we experience in contemporary times takes on new contours and evolves with remote work being more frequent in the lives of several profesionals for example network comunication requires that more atention be paid to managing emotion and understanding the dimensions of organizational solicitude mutual trust aces to help active empathy leniency in judgments and courage von krogh ichijo nonaka both are important in enabling the proceses of facilitating knowledge creation and why not also organizational inovation one of the theories that has stod out internationaly in contemporary times is the theory of enchantment especialy in times of remote work in recent publication on instagram the national schol of public administration enap linked to the ministry of economy of brazil posted on its oficial profile on august the folowing question why is it important to create and maintain rituals to generate conections with your co workers in the post enap mentions the american activist and writer chloé simone valdary who aplies the enchantment theory in leadership training and in the compasionate fight against racism as stated by enap the theory is inovative due to combining social emotional education character development and interpersonal growth as tol for leadership development in the theory aproach valdary blends elements of pop culture to facilitate the disemination and understanding of the dimensions and principles of the theory diseminated among students schols companies and governments in several countries including the united states south africa the netherlands germany and israel the theory was presented for the first time to brazilian audience during live online broadcast from enap on april chloé valdary spoke with diogo costa the president of enap and highlighted the importance of aplying the thre fundamental principles of the theory in the development of human beings namely treat people as human beings and not as political distractions when criticizing elevate and empower never with the intent to tear down or destroy doing everything with love an compasion love in the sense of the grek term agape not based on conditions enap in this discusion we highlight inovation in the context of public organizations and realize the relevance of leadership social emotional education and the theory of enchantment we also discus the interdisciplinary convergence betwen administration and information science and as result it is posible to transpose from the literature on family rituals in the context of psychology the conceptual distinction betwen ritual and routine to the organizational core taking as basis the question raised by enap why is it important to create and maintain rituals to generate conections with your co workers when proposing to think about enchantment in times of remote work we sought in azevedo rdbci campinas sp explanation under the perspective coined by fiese et al the diference betwen routine and ritual detailed in thre dimensions namely comunication investment and continuity regarding routines the first dimension refers to the instrumental act this is what neds to be done the second dimension refers to the temporary character and litle consistency after the routine is performed the third dimension tels us that it is directly observable and detectable by outsiders and the behavior repeats itself over time in contrast to rituals the first dimension refers to the symbolic act this is who we are the second dimension tels us that rituals are enduring and afective and the experience can be repeated in memory the third dimension refers to the extension of meaning acros generations and this is interpreted by insiders azevedo transposing such knowledge to the organizational environment we can understand that routines organize work proceses and their repetition over time can transform them into rituals through anticipation and emotional investment however ritual can become routine if it starts to be felt as an obligation we can consider that routines and rituals enable organizations to deal with the adversities that emerge from their performance whether public or private we can also consider that we canot disociate the study and research on inovation and remote work from socioemotional isues involving people of diferent generations especialy in the context of public educational libraries this inseparability is even more evident since it is space where these several generations met and sek to met information neds and other types of neds ranging from children entertainment to being suport point for tenagers after schol for refuge imigrants seking information to achieve their citizenship among others so far our reflective path has alowed us to realize that starting to think about inovation through remote work inserting public educational libraries constitutes broad debate with several chalenges besides he above it is also necesary to think about information policies in libraries and the ned for social and emotional education of young people and adults it is not posible to think about inovation in this context without trying to understand the isues that make sense for new generations such as the and alpha generations which are the most chalenging audience for libraries at the moment how to aply eficient library management to promote the development of the generations this is one of the implications of the debate which leads us to start thinking about generations management developing information actions that leverage the best of each one of them can be starting point of work and research agenda for research librarians in the context of the federal institutes public educational libraries have the comitment to atend and satisfy through their products and services the employed generations the unemployed ones and those who are in the proces of training to aces the world of work and employment very son the chalenge is even greater in this context thinking about the inovative contribution of the public educational library to the isue of remote work therefore wil require thinking that its strategic management may include everything from the analysis of reports to the evaluation of quantitative and qualitative indicators on the diversity of generations it is necesary to think what can enable more asertive actions such as the development of incentive programs for productivity the promotion of greater involvement of social actors in decision making proceses greater digital presence and engagement of young people and adults and other actions even motivational ones also focusing on the management of emotions in the workplace subject that has received more notoriety and relevance nowadays the pandemic and post pandemic context worldwide has inspired us to be creative inovative and adaptive we have learned by necesity at the time of the pandemic and are aplying to the new moment to work wel remotely moving towards hybrid models remote rdbci campinas sp and face to face activities more flexible and adaptable to networked social dynamics we are facing crises and oportunities promising service is in demand and public educational libraries are at the center of the problem and the solution from it solutions may emerge that contribute to inovation through remote work if posible ading the importance of the thre dimensions comunication investment and continuity defended by the enchantment theory along with its thre principles which colaborate in facing and breaking paradigms that interfere with productivity and organizational culture in the public sector promising service performed by brazilian public educational libraries importantly inovation in information services is central to the evolution of libraries public educational libraries have evolved to become remote workspaces with the purpose of serving comunities of profesionals who work and comunicate online is the creation of remote workspaces or zones in educational libraries realy promising and viable initiative perhaps the answer to this question is only posible with the implementation of public policies that guarante the promotion and therefore the adequate investment in infrastructure and beyond experimentation may be the best alternative for these libraries to become citizen laboratories and efectively fulfil their educational function with inovative services based on the idea of learning libraries guided by the five disciplines of peter senge personal mastery mental models team learning shared vision and systemic thinking other questions emerge from this conjuncture namely how to define the diversity of remote working profesionals who would sek the library as remote workspace posibly the implementation and management of distributed citizen labs can contribute to this knowledge of the public and their neds it is action and reflection in action that wil guide the evaluation and inovation agenda that is sought in remote work and libraries the very social mision of the federal institutes in the context of profesional and technological education in brazil with emphasis on the importance of ofering remote work suport service in public educational libraries justifies the investments in this segment of profesional performance of librarians what can we reflect on in this section to start thinking about the construction of work and research agenda the search for ways to contribute to the suces of digital transformation in the world of work which encompases greater public investment in libraries is chalenging digital transformation is proces not an arival point or destination in order to contribute to the formation and development of research agenda on inovation in the scientific field of information science and in the profesional field of federal institutes in brazil it is necesary to bring together researchers especialy research librarians linked to these institutions working in the country gabriel junior sousa and silva in their maping of the scientific literature on the most productive authors in the subject of inovation indexed in brapci in the period to identified that the only researcher linked to federal institute is the librarian and phd in information science valmira peruchi from the federal institute of paraíba fipb from this study it is observed change in this scenario with the begining of research agenda that can fil this gap and overcome the incipient scientific production on the theme from series of publications acording to this article that is also the result of doctoral research regarding the work agenda the function of the public educational libraries is to contribute to the federal institutes in their mision to promote teaching research and extension through profesional scientific and technological education with the union of information rdbci campinas sp education and technology to ensure sustainable local regional and national development even in the face of the context in which we find ourselves in which it is chalenge to build online the relations and structures of an educational institution as in the case of the federal institutes and their public educational libraries acording to paula silva and woida libraries are the basis of education serving as suport for teaching research and extension and for this reason they are reinventing themselves in the curent scenario by ofering services and informational products such as bok loans in delivery training workshops lives of information competence on how to use information sources safely for research standardization of academic papers scientific writing among others with the ned for the services provided by public educational libraries having to adapt during the pandemic to the social isolation and distance the profesionals who work in them had to adapt to new reality the remote work thus they have had to review their services and actions to continue with the importance they have always had in the educational context while stil meting the information neds of their users in satisfactory maner as quickly eficiently and efectively as posible as is customary trends are becoming reality in our day to day lives it must also be understod that they have had to reinvent themselves in ofering and making online information products and services acesible and easy to handle for users the user experience is central to this way of life to work with the emerging reality public educational libraries have expanded the use of services ofered on social networks such as instagram twiter and facebok as wel as service chanels using whatsap and electronic forms and have made available and asisted in the use of open aces databases that enable users to aces boks and scientific articles in this way the libraries have ben engaged in improving their information services and products by making information available through websites social media and networks such as instagram twiter facebok and other media these comunication means are great diseminates of information and where several subjects are conected daily causing information to circulate at greater sped because these informational chanels alow librarians and users not only to sek interaction but also to make information sharing paula silva woida the pandemic required the proces of joining technology and education forcing us to use in systematic and general way digital media for sharing information providing services and other activities it is necesary to think and plan for this post pandemic context with the ofer and creation of inovative spaces with services that ensure the safety and health of everyone involved in the libraries this proces can be guided by an agenda oriented to social development as the digital transformation guides contemporary life in al proceses and information flows agenda for social development and digital transformation drawing up work agenda in paralel to drawing up research agenda is not only posible but necesary these days there is clear inextricability betwen the work agenda and the research agenda as much as there is for social development and digital transformation from this century onwards in an experimental way in this section we wil adres proposal for work agenda that can be aplied in public educational libraries through research agenda that is being constituted in the scope of the research group on project management in education science rdbci campinas sp information and technology projecit linked to the ifpb campus joão pesoa and registered with the national council for scientific and technological development cnpq since some questions can be aplied via mail to the librarians responsible for the libraries in the system to have local sample of the perception of these managers on this subject and later expanded for comparative studies this is proposal for aplication in future studies there was no ned to aply questionaire at this point in the research because we are in stage of reflection these questions could be developed based on smal group of guiding questions namely during the pandemic what did you do diferently in your remote activities that you did not do before the pandemic and that may have generated inovation in the library is inovation through remote work posible traditionaly the library is study and research space for students do you think the library can become remote workspace for profesionals what conditions would you ned to make this service viable ruiz our translation states that al living beings share vulnerability not as weaknes but as that which in neding each other alows us to link aly and suport each other the researcher points out that this vulnerability became much more evident with the social and health crisis steming from the covid pandemic as argued by ruiz we have the potential to create colaborative networks in research and the workplace but we ned the resources and proper infrastructure to do so these resources and the necesary infrastructure can be obtained by formulating activity specific public policies in the public sector however it is first necesary to spread among librarians researchers public managers and other profesionals relevant to the isue in public organizations the potential of the public educational library in order to generate inovation from remote wor in this sense it is necesary to develop research agenda that suports work agenda so that information policies are asertively developed resources are alocated and the promotion is efectively caried out in these public sector environments that lack inovation chart first topics on the research agenda topic description organizational identity of libraries in federal institutes inovation remote working and infrastructure of educational libraries digital transformation and inovation in information services through projects learning and practice comunities in libraries and research groups users ned and experience in virtual learning networks social media marketing strategies for educational libraries public policies to combat intergenerational information poverty source authors the seven themes pointed out above do not exhaust or limit the research agenda that is being constituted they are the starting point for research work based on the science action method in the context of information science constituting an unprecedented proposal for intervention in the scientific field bringing theoretical contributions to scientific field that is increasingly aligned and closer to the practices of information profesionals and the neds of curent and future generations of information users and producers in networked society rdbci campinas sp final considerations the results highlight the posibility of inovation through remote work in the federal public service we are facing an oportunity to inovate in the public sector with promising service that can be performed by public educational libraries in federal institutes in brazil the apropriate infrastructure for remote workspaces we also observed an inseparability betwen the work agenda and the research agenda as wel as betwen social development and digital transformation from this century on as far as these educational libraries are concerned the study aims to contribute to the development of more asertive public policies for this type of library its public and its new work dynamics that are being constituted it is posible that solutions to real problems faced in the daily life of information profesionals wil be proposed based on the research agenda that is being developed at the inter institutional level the fruitful path that science action has ben building in information science in brazil with studies that bring together the theories in use in the profesional context with the theories proclaimed by the scientific field shows the posibilities of inovation that are to come the alignment of studies on educational library infrastructure with the development of smart cities in the context of creative economy entrepreneurship and digital transformation wil reveal new posibilities and solutions in the core of the field of information science to met the emerging demands of the network society it is therefore promising theme for us to start thinking about the construction of brazilian digital agenda based on the contributions of this scientific field we conclude that the paths to digital transformation in the world of work can become even more productive inovative profitable and sustainable when we sek continuous and adequate investment in infrastructure and inovation of libraries that fulfil an educational function and are of public nature folowing the high level of social relevance of the federal institutes in the context of inclusion through profesional scientific and technological education in brazil it is necesary stil continuous investment in the formulation of public policies especialy information policies to ensure the role of the librarian as an agent of inovation in federal institutes as the next step of the authors of this research considered as fruit of the research scientific article wil be comunicated on how the information policy corelates with the inovation policy in federal institutes covering in its discusion the theoretical pragmatic model for the development of information policies of brandão and the chalenges arising from the post pandemic scenario from the digital agenda elac and the recent actions ocured in brazil that favor the development of the digital society
