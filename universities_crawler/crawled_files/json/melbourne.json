{"university": "The University of Melbourne", "country": "Australia", "title": "Clearer and fairer land rights with digital systems", "content": "   6 minute read land rights are the cornerstone of world economies. university of melbourne researchers are helping the indonesian government modernise their land information system. the road map towards better land administration is based on local needs as well as international best practices. university of melbourne researchers have prepared a customised road map of 21 projects to modernise every aspect of indonesia’s land information system for the indonesian ministry of land affairs and spatial planning (kementerian agraria dan tata ruang / badan pertanahan nasional) modern land information systems give clarity around land rights and support land administration, sustainable development and urban planning the university of melbourne’s centre for spatial data infrastructures and land administration (csdila) has previously worked on similar projects with the victorian government, the world bank and the united nations committee of experts for global geospatial information management (un-ggim). “the centre for spatial data infrastructures and land administration team is helping the indonesian government to move from paper-based land administration to digital-based land administration,” says professor abbas rajabifard , the lead of the land information modernisation project. land administration connects physical information about the land’s features with legal information about the rights, restrictions and responsibilities. this is done through a series of steps and protocols – all of which the research team has considered for modernisation. based on the indonesian government’s vision and international best practices, professor rajabifard and his team have developed a customised road map of 21 projects to modernise indonesia’s land information system. the partnership has also included training and capacity building across the range of people involved in indonesian land administration processes, from land surveyors to government executives. “we are grateful for the training organised by csdila in 2020, which provided us with the opportunity to gain knowledge from csdila's experts in the field of land management and cadastre. this knowledge has allowed us to solidify our practical knowledge and increase the capacity of our staff to assist in the organisation of various activities in the ministry,” says himawan arief sugoto, senior advisor to the minister. the university of melbourne team is now working on a pilot for a modernised land information system, called smartland indonesia . land rights form the basis of world economies . modernising land administration gives clarity around land rights. in disasters like floods or landslides, paper records can be lost or destroyed. the government may not know who the land rights should be returned to. digital records also allow more information to be stored and connected. and having complete land information available across jurisdictions is important for emergency management, urban planning and land management. it could reveal a community’s resilience to natural disasters. for example, a community could be at risk of flooding due to the land’s topography and have poor access to road networks to escape. modern land information systems can also power sustainable development. digital records allow governments to better analyse how land is distributed. “the equal access to services and facilities is one part of the sustainable development indicators,” says professor rajabifard. many of the united nations’ 17 sustainable development goals are connected to land. better land information allows better measurement of progress towards those goals. the world bank recognises land rights as a cornerstone of world economies. in 2018 and 2019, it sent a group of indonesian executives to melbourne for a workshop on best practices in land administration and what modernisation of land administration looks like. the indonesian ministry of agrarian affairs and spatial planning asked the university of melbourne team to support their project management office on their land system modernisation journey. “we started exploring all the business processes on different levels – like the federal government, the regional, and also the local governments – in different jurisdictions across the entire indonesia,” says dr soheil sabri , the manager of the land information modernisation project. many changes are needed for a fully modernised land information system – even in law. “for example, in the indonesian context, the land title should be printed and stamped by the legal office,” dr sabri says. to fully digitise the indonesian land administration system, that law would need to change. the road map built by the university of melbourne proposed a suite of projects to address similar challenges and opportunities, modernising all aspects of the land administration workflow. beyond digitising a paper-based system, smartland indonesia may eventually integrate digital twin technology. a digital twin – a virtual representation of real-world entities and processes, synchronised with its real-world equivalent – could help convert a 2d land information system into 3d, giving a more holistic view of structures such as high-rise buildings in areas like jakarta. learn more about infrastructure research the centre for spatial data infrastructures and land administration (csdila) was established in 2001. csdila was funded by the victorian government land office to explore transitioning its paper-based land administration to a digital system. the victoria eplan was a pilot project launched in 2016 in partnership with land use victoria. it focused on the automatic validation of data collected and submitted to the land office. “that is one of the flagship projects that converted the research into practice. over those five years, the team has learned a lot of new knowledge and generated that knowledge as a repository for moving forward in different directions,” says professor rajabifard. developed countries like australia and developing countries like indonesia face different challenges in land administration. but work on the victoria eplan project helped csdila contribute to international land administration frameworks for the world bank and the united nations global geospatial information management (un-ggim). these frameworks are internationally recognised references for developing, renewing, reforming, strengthening, modernising or monitoring land information systems. they help countries achieve sustainable development goals. work on these international land administration frameworks led to the csdila’s introduction to un and world bank member states, including the indonesian government. indonesian ministry of land affairs and spatial planning

{"university": "The University of Melbourne", "country": "Australia", "title": "Digital disruption and the Law", "content": "the legal profession is finally experiencing the digital disruption that has swept through so many industries over the last decade. it’s transforming all aspects of lawyering, creating new ways of working in new markets with new roles and opening up new opportunities while traditional conventions wane. law graduates who understand the impact of digital innovations and are comfortable working with technology will be at an advantage with employers. so legal education needs to provide students with the technical skills to thrive in the digital world, and also the ability to navigate the complex ethical, legal and social implications of new technologies. while our future lawyers need to work in a digital world, it remains all the more important to recognise the value of some important elements of traditional legal education including research, critical thinking and analytical skills. this blend of old and new capabilities is the best chance we have to thrive in a rapidly changing world. there are areas where the digital transformation will be significant; we’re already seeing the impact in discovery, where artificial intelligence is both replacing work product from lawyers and at the same time improving the experience of law practice. other changes might create new types of legal work in new markets, for example, providing online high volume, low cost advice to under-served constituencies. at melbourne law school, for example, the students in our law apps class work in teams with not-for-profit clients to develop on-line legal information sources to provide assistance to those who might otherwise struggle to understand their legal rights and duties. other aspects of the law, however, will remain more complex and nuanced and require greater human input than predicted by those who foresee the end of traditional law firms. as legal educators, we need to draw on the best of the past while being innovative about responding to the future. some of the traditional values of high quality legal education remain pertinent (maybe even increasingly so) in a rapidly changing world. these elements should not be sacrificed when looking at reforms although, the precise way in which they are taught may need some modification. the nature of legal research, for example, might be changing, but the need for high-quality research skills is not. a careless and ill-defined search can give rise to a torrent of barely relevant, unimportant materials from around the world. the poorly trained law graduate haplessly reproduces as much of it as possible hoping that the right answer will mysteriously arise from the sea of information. students must understand the questions they are researching; have a deep familiarity with the best research tools for the particular task; understand the hierarchies at play in terms of court structures and forms of law; and have good judgment about which sources to use and when. none of these skills is straightforward and all of them require a serious educational effort both in law school and in professional training. creating opportunities for serious, deep and structured interdisciplinary experiences is another important aspect of contemporary legal education. it is likely interdisciplinary groups will give rise to the most innovative workplaces and solve the most intractable problems of our time. for a profession in which development has tended to be evolutionary and incremental for much of its history, the legal profession is now faced with a pace of change that has put serious pressure on many lawyers. as law firms examine their practices and adjust to the new world, other competitors and new ways of providing legal advice emerge. the pattern of change and challenge to the existing ways of doing things is likely to continue indefinitely. law schools likewise face challenges in responding to this new environment. with the number of graduate places for young lawyers diminishing, they must focus on both readying their students for those places and also preparing them for other roles in which their knowledge and skills can be used. in adapting to meet these new challenges, it is important law schools recognise that some of the traditional skills they impart to students will continue to be valuable for a long time to come. but neither can they close their eyes to the environment into which students are graduating and they need to be innovative and responsive in creating opportunities for students to develop new skills sets that will set them up to succeed even as the expectations of lawyers continues to shift over time. to mark law week (15 – 21 may 2017), pursuit is looking at some of the issues facing the profession in the 21st century. banner image: lady justice by alex proimos from sydney, australia/ wikimedia"},
{"university": "The University of Melbourne", "country": "Australia", "title": "How data can help prevent overdiagnosis", "content": "can knowing too much harm us? when it comes to medicine, in some cases, yes, absolutely. finding and treating diseases early saves lives and reduces health costs. it is why health systems have been increasingly undertaking proactive screening – administering clinical tests on individuals who don’t have any symptoms but may be at risk. examples include screening for diseases like bowel cancer or breast cancer. the ubiquity of digital technologies in our lives has the potential to take proactive screening to a new level – digital screening. this involves using information collected by our smartphones, smartwatches, keyboards, social networks, and wearable technology and analysing it using artificial intelligence algorithms to identify at-risk individuals. for example, the early onset of parkinson’s disease could be identified from the changing patterns of how someone types , while the risk of heart problems can be identified from abnormal heart rhythms detected by a smartwatch. while all this may sound good, the problem is that proactive screening can find things that might not be worth finding. there is overwhelming evidence that some diagnostic tests used in screening can find abnormalities that, while meeting the current definition of a disease, might have never made some people sick. these ‘diseases’ that would have never generated any problems are what we call cases of overdiagnoses and can lead to unnecessary and sometimes harmful treatments. and the emergence of digital screening could make this problem worse. overdiagnosis as a phenomenon has been seen in many well-known diseases, from some common cancers to attention deficit disorder. the most common scenario of overdiagnosis is when we actively seek diseases in asymptomatic patients, especially among healthier segments of the population. for example in some countries screening for thyroid cancer has led to a two-fold increase in the incidence of thyroid cancer, but no change in mortality. in other words, the screening hasn’t reduced deaths. similarly, studies have shown that screening for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder in children can lead to simply the youngest children in a school class being diagnosed. overdiagnosis has been observed for many cancers, including prostate cancer and breast cancer, as well as conditions like chronic kidney disease, gestational diabetes, high blood pressure and autism spectrum disorder. the extent of overdiagnosis is difficult to quantify but one report has suggested that an estimated 18-24 per cent of all cancers in australia may be cases of overdiagnosis. one reason behind overdiagnosis is the constant advance of technology, with newer, more sensitive tests being developed. among the latest advances in medicine is the possibility of using the massive amount of data we generate every day to find clues that might point to undiagnosed diseases. throughout our day we use smartphones, type emails, interact on social media and count our steps on our smartwatches. using artificial intelligence, the data can be used to find patterns that might help us detect diseases at an earlier stage. the collection and use of medical data raise ethical concerns, like those of privacy and data security. nonetheless, this is a very exciting time, and many benefits will probably emerge from these technologies. but just as with traditional diagnostic methods, overdiagnosis is still a risk that should be addressed. so, what can we do? in our recently published paper , we propose using data banks of longitudinal patient information – data collected over long periods of time – to analyse the historical trajectories of different diseases and identify those subgroups of patients who won’t be significantly affected, if at all, by a given disease. this data-driven approach could be used to improve disease definitions considering patient trajectories and identify the clinical attributes that might in the future allow clinicians to more accurately distinguish a diagnosis from an overdiagnosis. in a pilot study we conducted using a us hospital database with hundreds of thousands of hospital admissions, we trained an artificial intelligence algorithm to predict which patients were likely to develop sepsis in the next hours – sepsis is a complication of an infection in which the body’s own immune response begins to damage tissues and organs. we then looked at the patients flagged by the algorithm who actually went on to develop sepsis, based on official diagnostic criteria. among them, we found that almost 5 per cent of them had trajectories that appeared to be identical to those who never went on to develop sepsis. this suggests that we need more work on defining what is and what isn’t sepsis. the huge amounts of data that technology allows us to collect and analyse is an opportunity to better identify people early who need treatment before they become sick. but we also need to use big data to ensure we aren’t taking perfectly well people and turning them into sick patients. banner: getty images"},
{"university": "The University of Melbourne", "country": "Australia", "title": "Keeping robot finance fair", "content": "futurists tell us we are on the brink of a fourth industrial revolution. this one is all about the digital and technological disruption of how we used to do things. previous industrial revolutions saw many blue-collar manufacturing jobs replaced by machines, or disappear overseas to low-labour-cost countries. developed economies like australia successfully transitioned their labour force to white-collar service jobs. now these jobs are themselves under threat, and the financial services sector is not immune. many transactional services are moving online, or are being replaced by offshore call centres and, increasingly, by virtual services – robots or artificial intelligence systems. yet the finance sector has also embraced and thrived on the opportunities created by digital disruption. the traditional banking sector in particular is constantly challenged by new, nimble and highly competitive operators, and must either change the tune of its service provision or face commercial oblivion. the finance sector has in fact been remarkably resilient to change. in the ongoing capitalist battle of creative destruction, financial institutions seem to have had markedly greater longevity than manufacturing corporations. that could be explained by a sustained lack of competition, but it may also reflect an ability to adapt to new circumstances and adopt new technology like atms and internet banking, whenever and wherever they arise. there is no need for the financial establishment to significantly invest in research and development itself. banking corporations have adopted a similar strategy to big pharmaceuticals – let independent niche operators innovate and create start-ups and ventures, and when they succeed, simply buy them. for example, the successful australian upstarts specialising in low-cost mortgage lending (aussie and rams) were eventually bought by the traditional banks (cba and westpac, respectively). the sector’s resilience is not just due to an ability to cope remarkably well with external pressure. finance has become increasingly innovative and continuously reinvents itself to reduce the costs of regulation as well as the delivery of better products and services for customers. regulators and legislators often struggle to keep pace with the latest developments in investment assets, financial advice and risk management. that often leaves new providers operating in a regulatory vacuum that only gets filled once things have gone terribly wrong, or once lobbying pressure by the sector itself becomes too strong to ignore. the cost of unregulated innovation on the public could be significant. consider, for example, the fact that financial innovations like portfolio insurance and collateralised debt obligations contributed to the 1987 stock market crash and the 2007-08 global financial crisis, respectively. rather than wait for legislation and regulation to catch up, we should therefore ask ourselves whether the ethics underpinning these innovations pass the morality test. digital technology will arguably improve market access for new (niche) financial institutions, as well as competition, and make markets and services more efficient. robot trading and advice can significantly reduce fees, improve transparency, and make financial services more accessible. there is even a suggestion that robot finance will democratise the sector and lead to a more just and fair financial system for all. human foibles and manifestations of conflicts of interest can simply be switched off. taking out human interaction could transform a possibly immoral finance sector to an entirely amoral one where moral considerations simply have no role to play. unfortunately, this dehumanisation of finance raises its own ethical concerns. as finance sector legislation/regulation often significantly lags developments and practices, how can we be sure that financial entrepreneurs even consider the ethical implications of their new business models? after all, financial institutions often innovate to reduce the cost of regulation on conducting financial transactions. these concerns extend from breaches of client information privacy to, more generally, neglect of a duty to clients. perhaps surprisingly, they seem to have increased with the introduction of digital technology service platforms. while the platforms are notionally neutral, they don’t recognise a client’s financial sophistication or lack thereof. this digital revolution is rapidly replacing physical markets and bank branches and employees with online platforms and smartphone technology. even the world of financial advice, which is still clinging to face-to-face transactions, might well be replaced by robot advice in the near future. the platforms are cheap to develop, easy to implement, and effectively marketed. this creates an entirely new competitive landscape, with start-ups and small players specialising in specific services instantly becoming competitive entrants. whereas regulators used to impose the same regimes on incumbents and newcomers, who were thereby disadvantaged, they now seem to provide regulatory exception to new initiatives. public distrust of the finance sector has weakened the lobbying power of the incumbents and convinced the regulators to encourage innovation and competition by newcomers. the price paid, however, is possibly unchecked unethical behaviour by the innovators. this is an edited extract from ‘a matter of trust: the practice of ethics in finance’ by paul kofman and clare payne, published by melbourne university press. more information is available here . banner image: getty images"},
{"university": "The University of Melbourne", "country": "Australia", "title": "Building resilient cities with digital tools", "content": "   3 minute read in a recent webinar, panellists discussed how the application of technology can address critical ecological and urban design issues, like adapting cities to climate change. modern city planning needs a great deal of data. big problems like adapting our cities to the impacts of climate change require complex solutions. digital technologies help urban designers pool different sources of data and consider their problems using systems thinking, rather than approaching them one project at a time. in our recent infrastructure webinar integrated design for resilient urban landscapes, four panellists in conversation with city of melbourne’s mark allan discussed how the application of technology can address critical ecological and urban design issues. watch webinar chief among the digital tools to tackle complex urban design issues are urban digital twins. a digital twin is a virtual representation of the built and natural environment of cities, the living entities with them, and the processes that make cities tick, like transport networks. “there are three main components in an urban digital twin,” said panellist dr soheil sabri , senior research fellow in urban analytics at the university of melbourne. dr sabri managed the fishermans bend digital twin project. the first urban digital twin component is the real world. the second is the digital world, where real-world objects and processes are represented. the third is the underpinning technology that connects the real world to the digital world and enables synchronisation between the two. why are they useful? an urban environment is a complex, dynamic environment where housing, environment, transport and many other factors work together. “any time you make a change to one, you’re affecting all eight or nine other systems that are at work on the streets and in our public realm,” said panellist dr nano langenheim , lecturer in landscape architecture and urban design at the university of melbourne. urban designers can use digital twins to plug in data from several different sources to understand how these systems interact. where relevant data is available in open data resources, urban planning projects could save time and money. however, researchers and planners often collect data for a specific purpose. data collected for understanding the free flow of traffic – while representing the same streets – may not have the information another researcher needs about footpath quality. “what we are seeing through digital transformation is certainly a pressure on maturity in the marketplace for … understanding what the information management requirements are at the end of the project,” said panellist mr james barrow, mixed reality and digital engineering lead at ghd. good data management standards that help define the type, accuracy, currency and purpose of data collected can ensure its longevity. and that longevity starts with curiosity about what other users’ needs are, mr barrow explained. ensuring the usability of data beyond a single project increases its value. city planners are already tackling the impacts of climate change: increased rainfall, rising sea levels and increasing temperatures. the city of melbourne is using digital technologies and data in projects like increasing tree canopy cover and understanding the microclimates around the city to combat the effects of extreme heat events. “heat is in fact a more dangerous killer of people in australia than any other natural hazard,” said ms tiffany crawford, co-chief heat officer at the city of melbourne. but she believes the solutions to climate change are available. “what it now requires is different thinking, innovation and partnership. i think that the great minds watching this and present today are a big part of that. keep going!” ms crawford said. learn more about infrastructure research. first published on 26 january 2023.

{"university": "The University of Melbourne", "country": "Australia", "title": "Lawyers must adapt to the age of digitalisation", "content": "technology continues to transform the practices of every organisation around the world. but if we look specifically at the legal profession, these digital transformations can bring unanticipated legal and ethical risks. in-house legal departments used to be viewed as a hallowed black box and, although it was unclear what they did, their decisions were highly regarded. in recent years, in-house lawyers have extended out into new areas of business, like environmental, social and governance, where they have a larger role in designing and influencing the rest of their company. general counsels are now devoting more time to strategic emphasis and less time to day-to-day business. as janet taylor-hall, chief executive of the legal service provider cognia law, states – in-house lawyers engage with the sales team or procurement department, sitting down with them to develop templates, contracts or negotiation rules. most importantly, there’s a been a major change in the deployment of technology by in-house legal departments to gather data. analysing this data can identify emerging trends and provide early notice of larger problems – like an increase in the number of new lawsuit claims. a 2021 report by the corporate legal operations consortium (cloc) shows more than half of the participants – around 66 per cent – answered that their organisation views the legal department as totally integrated into their strategy and business. according to only three per cent of respondents, the in-house legal department provides strictly legal advice. australian businesses are now at risk of significantly higher cyber attacks because of their reliance on web-based applications. but when it comes to cyber threat response, only 54 per cent of companies have a comprehensive cyber-threat response strategy that involves their legal departments. cyber breaches can result not only in significant financial loss but also in reputational damage. so, the intervention of a competent legal team can mitigate those risks. as an example of one of these privacy breaches, human rights watch (hrw) has accused adobe connect application and minecraft: education edition of violating their privacy policies and collecting children’s personal data for non-educational purposes. this highlights the need for in-house lawyers with extensive understanding of technology, who are able to predict potential legal breaches and guide their employers throughout the early stages of new technology development. australia’s privacy act , currently under review , is out of date in the digital age. while legislators attempt to amend and supplement the relevant legislation to become more adaptable to technological change, lawyers continue to face legal challenges related to evolving digitalisation and it’s hard to say if these adaptions of the law really go far enough. recently, consumer group choice investigated whether australian retailers kmart, bunnings and the good guys were violating the privacy act by using facial recognition technology to capture and collect a “faceprint” of customers who entered selected stores. around 76 per cent of consumers were unaware that businesses used video cameras for this purpose. stores using facial recognition technology in this way is similar to “gathering your fingerprints or dna every time you shop”. under the privacy act, biometric data gathered by facial recognition technology is considered sensitive personal data. clearly, existing laws are lacking when it comes to protecting us from potentially harmful facial recognition technology. in these cases, it’s not clear whether the decision to deploy this technology wasn’t run past the legal teams in their respective organisations, whether the legal teams under-estimated the potential public backlash, or if they didn’t have sufficient understanding of the nuances of facial recognition to realise the potential risks – or perhaps some combination of all three. in any case, having tighter involvement with a better informed legal team may have raised concerns earlier or led to these organisations informing their customers in a more transparent way. it is very important to understand and examine how in-house lawyers become involved in procuring, designing, deploying and overseeing the emerging digital technologies in their firms and how they mitigate risks associated with emerging technologies. what is unclear is whether current legal education and training is sufficient for lawyers providing advice on emerging technology. firstly, for many new applications of emerging technology, there may be several areas of existing legislation that apply but most of these were designed without these technological advances in mind. secondly, often no precedent exists for many issues regarding emerging technology. and this puts lawyers in a position of needing to understand the implications of emerging technology and provide legal and ethical advice without clear legislation and precedents. only once lawyers and law students understand the underlying legal and technical frameworks of emerging digital technology and are well-equipped to respond to technology-related issues will they be able to mitigate the legal risks associated with them. the centre for ai and digital ethics (caide) is launching a new project to ensure that lawyers understand the underlying legal and technical frameworks of emerging digital technology. the four-year project new legal thinking for emerging technologies  is funded by the menzies foundation under the ninian stephen law program . the first phase is to understand how lawyers currently address these problems. if you are an in-house lawyer who has given legal or ethical advice on technology, we invite you for a one-hour online interview. please contact dr fahimeh abedi abedi.f@unimelb.edu.au if you are interested and available for an interview before 28 july 2022. banner: getty images"},
