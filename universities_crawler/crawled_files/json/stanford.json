digital transformation to create more connected and cohesive experiences. they include: product or service offerings assets processes decision-making organizational structure additionally, there are four types of digital transformation that your organization may pursue: this type of digital transformation focuses on using analytics, kpis, machine learning, artificial intelligence, and other tools to improve internal processes and operations. ultimately, corporations use process transformation to identify areas where procedures could improve and leverage digital solutions to make said processes more streamlined and cohesive, resulting in operational efficiency. through business model transformation, leadership teams have the power to modify traditional enterprise structures and improve efficiency. this type of digital transformation can be cumbersome, as it involves redefining the foundational building blocks of how a business operates and delivers its products or services. however, the result is a business model that adapts to and produces what consumers are looking to attain. domain transformation modifies how a company’s website is structured. this type of digital

require every member of the organization to adopt a digital-first mindset. while the world has been progressively becoming more digitally savvy, the in-person barriers due to covid-19 have accelerated the need for efficient technology. from scheduling doctor visits to ordering takeout delivery, digital tools have weaved their way into every area of our lives. therefore, businesses need to be ready

digital transformation within an organization and they’ll likely talk about hiring exceptional tech talent, understanding the latest breakthroughs in fields like ai, machine learning, and robotics, and providing the space and support to design systems and solutions that work. ooops. looks like you have javascript turned off! this means you can't see the form on this page you can use to . if you asked dr. pamela hinds, the fortinet founders chair and professor of management science & engineering at stanford and co-director of the center on work, technology, and organization, she would say that’s a good start. understanding the technologies that underpin digital transformation is necessary but not sufficient. radically remaking an organization's products, services, and business models requires not just understanding technology, but also cultural change. as dr. hinds explains in the webinar, , most traditional organizations simply cannot cope with the pace of innovation happening now. they were built for reliability, not for speed. a growing body of evidence shows organizations that manage to transform themselves also undergo significant cultural change from root to tip. what does that cultural change look like? in the webinar, dr. hinds outlines five essential shifts organizations must make to succeed at digital transformation. the first and most essential shift is towards a more customer centric culture. digital transformation doesn’t happen for its own sake. it happens to serve customers better and drive the business forward. if you don’t understand your customers’ unmet needs, the other aspects of your digital transformation won’t be focused on the right goals. you can have cutting-edge technology and processes, but they won’t move your business forward if they don’t ultimately help you delight your customers. once you understand where you’re trying to get to with your digital transformation, it’s key to move quickly in that direction. but the path of digital transformation is rarely if ever a straight line. the pace of change requires organizations to pivot regularly. you need to be both fast and nimble. that kind of agility often requires rethinking organizational structures. traditional hierarchical structures like multi-layer decision making and lengthy approval processes can get in the way of the ability to take advantage of opportunities rapidly. building for the future requires targeted demolition of out-dated structures. essential checks must, of course, remain, but successful digital transformation requires clearing obstacles to quick experimentation and implementation. traditionally, when organizations wanted to innovate or update their offerings, they would go out and hire someone with the right kind of expertise to drive that change. but when it comes to today’s digital transformation, experts don’t exist. change is happening so fast that even the most qualified and experienced employees must constantly update their knowledge. that is why it is so important to build a culture of curiosity and voracious learning if an organization is aiming for digital transformation. “  in order to drive new knowledge creation, you need to have people not just willing to, but passionate about, going and learning new things and thinking in new ways,” dr. hinds explains in the webinar. the best, most ground-breaking ideas are often born out of unusual combinations of expertise or technology. traditional org charts can silo in knowledge, making that kind of fruitful cross-pollination less likely. a culture of unbounded collaboration, on the other hand, allows or even incentivizes employees to work across traditional boundaries, for instance in cross-functional groups. sometimes it even means working outside of the organization when you need to access expertise that doesn't exist within the organization itself. historically, this kind of interdisciplinary work was handled asynchronously. one team would work on their portion of a project before handing it off to another team. that iterative process is just not fast enough anymore. for digital transformation to succeed a culture of unbounded collaboration is essential. trying lots of new and out-of-the box ideas is essential to learn what works and what doesn’t in the uncertain and fast-moving process of digital transformation. but employees are unwilling to try new things if they believe they will be laughed at or even punished if their ideas fail. organizations must explicitly incentivize risk taking and even failure. by this hinds doesn’t mean . when we know how to do something right and just get sloppy, that’s a preventable failure that should be discouraged. but organizations should encourage the other kind of failure discussed by edmonsdon – intelligent failures at the frontier. these are failures that provide new knowledge. they’re learning opportunities. for digital transformation to succeed, an organization’s culture must embrace this second sort of failure. the bottom line for dr. hinds — and for those both leading and participating in digital transformation — is that success is as much about the right culture as it is about the right technology. “digital transformation requires rethinking organizations, cultures, structures, and systems, and the way that people think about their work and work together,” she believes. these changes aren’t just for industries that we usually think of as hi-tech, nor are they just the preserve of top executives.   ”even industries that are typically thought about as being low-tech will be and are experiencing radical changes,” dr. hinds says, recalling a recent trip to a dairy farm where the cows were milked automatically and output was monitored remotely via ipad. “it's important to be ready,” she concludes. “[digital transformation] is pervasive and it is always better to be in the know and be able to anticipate some of these things so that we can get ahead of them and make a contribution.” for those looking to prepare, is available here, or learn more about that greatly expands on these principles. ce0131 stanford school
