{"university": "Technical University of Munich", "country": "Germany", "title": "TUM Campus Heilbronn in the center of digital transformation", "content": "ai25 is striving to develop and test digital solutions for the factory of the future and implement them in vehicle production and logistics for series production within the next five years, with the overarching goal of making these key components of the production process even more efficient and flexible. particularly beneficial will be neckarsulm’s expertise in small-series and volume production. “we already have extensive experience in the areas of vehicle production, logistics and production it at our neckarsulm site. we will further enhance these capabilities in a targeted manner as part of the transformation. with our dedicated team of experts and our partners in the automotive initiative 2025 we develop the site into a leading factory for digital production and logistics within the group,” said peter kössler, board member for production and logistics at audi. as part of the bildungscampus heilbronn and the heilbronn-franken region’s innovation and it network, the site will help to develop such future thinking solutions as the use of artificial intelligence or intuitive man-machine interaction. xl2, the heilbronn-based joint venture founded last year by audi and capgemini, will play an important role when it comes to bringing it innovations to the audi plants around the world. with academic support from the fraunhofer iao and the technical university of munich, xl2 will collaborate with additional it experts from capgemini, sap and aws to develop the it solutions required for a smart and connected factory. the basis for this collaboration is the digital production platform (dpp), in which the data of every machine, piece of equipment and system from every plant in the volkswagen group are pooled. the sites thus become part of the industrial cloud, which in the future will also include the group’s supply chain as well as additional partners. with neckarsulm and ingolstadt, the first two audi sites have already been connected to the dpp; the remaining sites will follow later this year. in their collaboration, the companies will be leveraging aws technologies in the areas of the internet of things (iot), machine learning and computing services that will be developed specifically for the production environment and adapted to the requirements of the automotive industry. furthermore, the use of the sap s/4hana platform will lay the foundation for the next generation of digital production processes, on which the companies will work together on solutions for modular production and interoperable vehicle logistics. as part of this interdisciplinary collaboration between research, industry and it, the companies will use industry-specific applications of the sap industry cloud in the areas of machine learning, robotic process automation and business process intelligence, which are holistically aligned with future needs for the automation and digitalization of the automotive industry. “with the automotive initiative 2025, we have created a pioneering, interdisciplinary network between academia, research, it companies and automobile manufacturing. the initiative uses sound science to drive the digital transformation of automobile production within the overall context of technology, organization and particularly continuing education,” explains professor helmut krcmar from the technical university of munich. “ai25 is characterized by its holistic view of the digital transformation and by its clear ties to the real world. we study both strategic topics and concrete use cases that accelerate the digital transformation and generate new innovative ideas,” added frank loydl, chief information officer (cio) at audi ag. the initiative is also expected to become an idea foundry and driver for the digital transformation of production and logistics throughout the volkswagen group. the knowledge gleaned will be used to help shape the future it configuration of the automotive plants and expand this sustainably at audi. other goals include the definition of generally applicable standards for the transformation and the rollout of concrete use cases to all group plants worldwide via the industrial cloud. ai25 is striving to develop and test digital solutions for the factory of the future and implement them in vehicle production and logistics for series production within the next five years, with the overarching goal of making these key components of the production process even more efficient and flexible. particularly beneficial will be neckarsulm’s expertise in small-series and volume production. “we already have extensive experience in the areas of vehicle production, logistics and production it at our neckarsulm site. we will further enhance these capabilities in a targeted manner as part of the transformation. with our dedicated team of experts and our partners in the automotive initiative 2025 we develop the site into a leading factory for digital production and logistics within the group,” said peter kössler, board member for production and logistics at audi. as part of the bildungscampus heilbronn and the heilbronn-franken region’s innovation and it network, the site will help to develop such future thinking solutions as the use of artificial intelligence or intuitive man-machine interaction. xl2, the heilbronn-based joint venture founded last year by audi and capgemini, will play an important role when it comes to bringing it innovations to the audi plants around the world. with academic support from the fraunhofer iao and the technical university of munich, xl2 will collaborate with additional it experts from capgemini, sap and aws to develop the it solutions required for a smart and connected factory. the basis for this collaboration is the digital production platform (dpp), in which the data of every machine, piece of equipment and system from every plant in the volkswagen group are pooled. the sites thus become part of the industrial cloud, which in the future will also include the group’s supply chain as well as additional partners. with neckarsulm and ingolstadt, the first two audi sites have already been connected to the dpp;

{"university": "Technical University of Munich", "country": "Germany", "title": "Survey in the Heilbronn-Franken region", "content": "the study shows: nearly two thirds (62%) of the companies do not yet have a digital transformation strategy. more than half of them also have no plans to strategically address the issue in the future. even among the strategically well-positioned enterprises, around half see digitalization only as a one-off project and not as an ongoing process. the bigger the company, the more likely it is to have a concept in place. but even among those with more than 250 employees, nearly one third have no strategy. most companies taking a strategic approach to digitalization are doing so with the goal of reducing costs, for example by automating processes. only one in four is trying to use digital technologies to develop innovations, adopt new business models or gain access to further markets. however, one third of the companies with a strategic outlook plan to pursue such objectives in order to increase sales in the coming years. consequently, the mittelstand companies are mostly using established technologies that offer immediate benefits, such as cloud computing and connectivity. only one quarter of those surveyed regard artificial intelligence (ai) as important for their own operations and just 2 percent are using it. “the pragmatism of many mittelstand firms is certainly justified,” says jens förderer , professor of innovation and digitalization at the tum campus heilbronn. “digitalization does not offer equally large benefits regardless of when and where it is implemented. but it is a mistake to treat it as a new automation wave and focus on a few adjustments with a short-term impact. it involves a fundamental transformation of business models and markets affecting companies of all sizes. without clear objectives and good planning, companies risk a loss of competitiveness.” the companies without strategies listed specific problems preventing them from taking action. around 50% mentioned an inadequate digital infrastructure and 40% the unavailability of skilled personnel. one-third cited excessive bureaucracy and a lack of skills in their own workforce. the companies already managing the digital transformation present a similar picture: more than half of them cited skills shortages, bureaucracy and poor infrastructure as the key impediments. “it is alarming to note that barriers over which companies have no control play a much bigger role than internal factors. this further discourages laggards from actively tackling the digital transformation,” says dr. christoph geier, director digital transformation at the tum campus heilbronn. “policy makers, public administration and associations need to create the conditions so that even small companies can make a successful transformation. this will be essential for retaining global market leaders and hidden champions in the region.” the research team also asked the smes to state who is responsible for the digital transformation within the company and which partners they wanted to work with. in more than 70% of the respondent companies, the top management was directly responsible for the operational implementation. very few smes are cooperating with other companies. just 13% are using cloud platforms, 10% strategic sales partners and 7% online marketplaces. only about one third of the companies see it as important to draw on external expertise, for example through consultancies or universities. “managing digitalization from the boss’s desk – it sounds good in principle,” says michaela lindenmayr, a researcher at the professorship for innovation and digitalization. “the top management must ensure a strategic approach to the digital transformation. in some cases, however, it is fair to ask whether senior executives can invest enough time and whether the company is making good use of the skills in the functional units. the specialized knowledge and skills of possible partners also harbor enormous potential that companies should not do without.” the study shows: nearly two thirds (62%) of the companies do not yet have a
