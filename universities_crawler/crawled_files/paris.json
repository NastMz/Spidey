{"university": "PSL Université Paris", "country": "France", "title": "Supporting and training professors: the missions of the PSL Center for Teaching Innovation", "content": "the university’s psl center for teaching innovation, created in 2021, supports all psl professors and teaching staff in their educational projects. in this interview, mattias mano, the center’s new director, outlines the center’s strategic missions and looks back on the lessons learned during the pandemic, which has increased the use of digital tools in education as in other sectors.  mattias mano: the main mission of the center for teaching innovation is to support psl professors and education officers in their educational transformation projects. the goal is to enhance and diversify educational practices in order to promote the success of all students. to achieve this goal, we offer two types of services: the first is focused on supporting faculty members. our center is at their service. assistance from the center for teaching innovation involves supporting professors in their reflection on how to continuously improve their teaching. the center’s educational engineers, with their diverse experience and scientific oversight, are able to understand and suggest solutions to teaching problems that professors may encounter. the second is focused on training faculty members. through the in-house psl school, we offer a great number of training programs to raise their understanding of the changes currently taking place in education. this is given particular focus during the welcome week for new professors, a perfect time to promote the center, or during pédagodays, two days of peer-to-peer exchanges to reflect on one’s own teaching practices. the main challenge ahead of us is raising the profile of the center and its services. we need to reach out to all psl schools. the aim is to understand the specific characteristics of their teaching, to compile their needs in relation to the center’s services, and of course, to meet them. this will be achieved by building a community of practice for psl faculty members. far from replacing the role of the teacher, technology is a supplementary tool that can compensate for potential shortcomings, especially in times of crisis. mattias mano: the health crisis we have gone through has put students, most of all, in a situation of great difficulty. too many of them have become very isolated. professors have also shown an unprecedented degree of resilience in ensuring the infamous ‘instructional continuity’. this continuity was made possible largely thanks to digital tools, with videoconferencing in the main. however, for many professors, this forced experimentation with remote learning was very negative. i would like to highlight the strength and courage of the administrative staff (especially in the information systems department and in our center), who made it possible to maintain teaching during an emergency situation.* as the crisis nears its end, which we all hope will be for good, services like the center for teaching innovation cannot ignore the fact that many professors may harbor a desire to do things ‘as before’ (the pandemic). overall, the pandemic has advanced us by several years in terms of our understanding of digital tools. its impact is a powerful reminder that, far from replacing the role of the teacher, technology is a supplementary tool that can compensate for potential shortcomings, especially in times of crisis. the center for teaching innovation aims to synthesize this wealth of experience. our goal is to perpetuate the best practices that have emerged from the crisis and to extend their use. * innovation pédagogique, l’enseignement en situation d’urgence en france , july 9, 2020, by perrine de coëtlogon, mattias mano, bertrand mocquet . mattias mano : digital technology is just a tool. we will never push the use of a tool for the sake of it. when a teacher asks us to implement a particular moodle activity or a particular wooclap activity, we seek first and foremost to meet an educational need. for example, using wooclap facilitates the interaction between students and the professor in an auditorium. this tool makes it possible to pause a lecture and ask the students questions, to ensure that they can follow what they are being taught. similarly, almost all classes rely on the use of educational resources. the moodle learning platform is used to centralize and classify these resources. professors have the option to upload all of them when they build their course, and to make them available to students as they go along. this reduces the administrative load of a course and facilitates the learning process. in short, once educational needs have been identified, the center helps the teacher find the best way to meet them. very often, the digital tools at our disposal make it easier to offer a solution.  mattias mano: the simplest way to find out more about our activities and to get in touch is to visit our website. there you will find interviews with professors, useful information, a calendar of the training courses we offer at the psl school, and most importantly, how to contact us for a support request. the pédagodays - psl, which will be held on june 16 and 17 ( registration via the psl school ) are also a great way to find out more about us. on these days we will be offering workshops and discussions with teachers who have worked with us in the past. we also have three branches in three different locations on campus: dauphine – psl, mines paris – psl and observatoire de paris – psl. these are friendly, social places, so don’t hesitate to come and have a coffee!  doctor of management from the institut polytechnique de paris, alumni of the master’s program in data science (formerly quantitative methods and social science) from ensae and the research master’s in economics from the paris school of economics, mattias mano developed the digitization of the ‘executive education’ training offer at the ecole polytechnique as digital learning manager from 2018 to 2022. during his dissertation on collective intelligence in online forums, he also coordinated the teaching team of the mooc, \" how to write and publish a scientific paper ” offered by the ecole polytechnique on the coursera platform, which now has almost 200,000 registrants. he joined université psl in february 2022 as director of the center for educational innovation.

psl, at the interface between diffuser optics, signal processing and machine learning. https://www.lighton.ai/ energo is a greentech start-up incubated at chimie paristech – psl. it is developing revolutionary chemical transformation technology, based on the combination of catalysis and plasma activation. this combination makes it possible to perform chemical reactions at ambient temperature and pressure, without requiring pre-treatment, which makes this technology clean and decarbonized. it is mainly used to produce renewable gas by transforming co and co2 from waste processing or industrial processes into ch4. https://energo.green/ calyxia is a start-up born out of high-level scientific research performed at the colloids and divided materials laboratory (umr cbi 8231) of espci paris - psl in partnership with the experimental soft condensed matter group at harvard university. the results of this research led to technological disruption in the field of encapsulation of active ingredients, which in practice has meant new levels of performance in laundry products, agriculture and advanced materials, while responding to sustainable development issues. https://www.psl.eu/en/node/259 woodoo is a start-up founded by timothée boitouzet (ceo) in 2016. incubated at chimie paris - psl, woodoo is specialized in manufacturing a new composite wood material with pioneering optical and physical properties for the mobility and construction industry. https://woodoo.com/ aqemia – this new-generation pharmaceutical company has generated a medication discovery pipeline with exponential growth. it is based on algorithms developed during eight years of fundamental research in a laboratory in the ens - psl chemistry department. aqemia was founded by maximilien levesque (at the time a researcher at ens – psl) and emmanuelle martiano. technology is used to combine artificial intelligence and statistical and quantum physics, making it possible to predict whether a molecule is effective for a specific target, at a speed that is unequaled on the market. since aqemia’s creation in 2019, it has experienced spectacular growth and recruited over 40 scientists as permanent employees. https://www.aqemia.com/ astraveus is a start-up incubated at espci paris – psl that is revolutionizing the field of cell gene therapy (cgt) manufacturing with the lakhesys™ platform, an end-to-end cell foundry, which uses deep process optimization and single-use, microfluidic bioprocessors to deliver better results with reduced inputs. by removing the need for large-scale infrastructure, reducing costs, and overcoming the logistical challenges typically associated with cgt manufacturing, astraveus is seeking to transform patient access to these life-changing therapies. https://www.astraveus.com/ dna script was created to revolutionize the synthesis of dna using enzymes. it draws on the combined work of researchers from espci paris – psl and mines paris – psl. these efforts in r&d have led to innovations in enzyme engineering, surface and nucleotide chemistry, and instrumentation. when these innovations were put into application, syntax™ was born, the world’s first benchtop dna printer that runs on enzyme technology. https://www.espci.psl.eu/fr/innovation/l-incubateur-pc-up/dna-script lifen, founded by mines paris -

{"university": "PSL Université Paris", "country": "France", "title": "Launch of a course dedicated to intrapreneurship and digital transformation", "content": "in september 2018, université psl and the web school factory will launch a new 10-month diploma course in intrapreneurship and digital transformation. this diploma offering is a new initiative for cfee (campus formation etudiants entreprises). with an emphasis on autonomy and expertise, the goal is to bring students, employees and professionals together in collaborative project teams and to train them.  interview with the managers of the training program: anne lalou , director of web school factory and bruno rostand , director of innovation and entrepreneurship at université psl.  bruno rostand : it is indeed a partnership of a new type, but at psl we are used to creating bridges between disciplines and players…we were contacted by the web school factory to develop a joint response to the pia disrupt campus call for proposals and saw this as an opportunity to further diversify our approaches and discover new perspectives, particularly in the areas of innovation and digital transformation, which are priorities for us. anne lalou : by co-creating this curriculum, we wanted, and this is very new, to get involved in setting up companies and open them to new innovative ecosystems. to meet this challenge, the campus of formation etudiants entreprises is based on three pillars. while taking into account the new skills needed in today's digital world, we wanted to not only implement collaborations between students and employees, but also, create a new project-based training program. cfee will develop the creativity, entrepreneurship and innovation capabilities of our students anne lalou : in companies, innovation is being done more and more by \"intrapreneurial\" approaches. in practice, this means that an sme or a large group gives some of its employees the time and support necessary for the development of a project that could, potentially, turn into a profitable business. intrapreneurship offers companies the opportunity to think outside the box and open up to the vitality of the entrepreneurial ecosystem... digital transformation and innovation will increasingly go through this type of approach and we wanted to support the framework of cfee by providing students and employees with the necessary tools. bruno rostand : similar to our entrepreneurship trainings ( iti , psl-pépite ), cfee will develop the creativity, entrepreneurship and innovation capacities of our students, but intrapreneurship starts with a concrete challenge to answer the needs of a partner company, and this brings a new dimension: an immersion in the life of the company and an experience of the digital transition which happens there. in this regard cfee completes and enriches our training offer and, moreover, some of the activities of cfee will take place at the psl-lab, coworking space of the psl-pépite entrepreneurship group. anne lalou : there will be many of them. the impact of the cfee student training will be, in my opinion, quite immediate. the web school factory already exists. student projects give a fresh look at the teams of partner companies. it is a fruitful interaction that moves lines and opens additional interesting perspectives. the students of the cfee will be able to profit from it. this new curriculum is also, in our opinion, an investment of the future. it will complement the training of shs students or psl engineering students by providing them with expertise and experience in digital transformation.   besides the mixing of social origins, internationalization or parity, intergenerational is essential. cfee will be an example. bruno rostand : students have a lot to learn from employees about the reality of a market and business experiences. in return, they bring a fresh look to which the rigor and the level of requirement of their training match. employees will leave their comfort zone, put aside their certainties, to bring out innovative and transformative concepts for their company. anne lalou : we bet that this intergenerational collaboration will be stimulating, constructive and, above all, that it will serve as a founding experience for their lifelong training: to learn in initial training, in continuing education, online or even in groups… these formats will disappear and it is a great opportunity for the players to experience it at this stage. we talk a lot about diversity in today's world. besides the mixing of social origins, internationalization or parity, intergenerational diversity is essential. cfee will be an example. start-ups, i hope, will emerge from this program. and after all, rather than finding a job, why not create it? anne lalou : more than recruitments, i want the cfee curriculum to lead learners to a concrete ambition, offering them a taste for innovation and creativity. start-ups, i hope, will emerge from this program. and after all, rather than finding a job, why not create it? the key is to develop the capacity for transformation and innovation, inside and outside organizations. cfee will be the proof that our companies today are ready to innovate differently, organizations must accept confrontation and understand that student collaboration can result in great new concepts. that's what i want for our students!  anne lalou : dear learners, a unique opportunity awaits you to start a new chapter of your training. seize this opportunity, see yourself as pioneers forging your individual paths and future! create innovation today and tomorrow. do not limit yourself, be ambitious, be resolutely intrapreneurial, because the transformation of our economic landscape also happens with you. bruno rostand : dear students, be a part of the digital revolution alongside our partner companies; rise to the challenge, and collaborate with a diverse multicultural and intergenerational team! dear employees of our business partners, come share your experiences and ambitions with our students in order to co-create the solutions of tomorrow!

{"university": "PSL Université Paris", "country": "France", "title": "Educating Students and Employees in the Realities of the Business World", "content": "the digital transformation is ushering in a host of new business practices. in september, to help today’s managers, decision-makers, entrepreneurs and employees draw on those latest practices to enhance their capacity for innovation, creativity and autonomy, psl and the web school factory introduced the new cfee program (campus formation etudiants entreprises), a 10-month interdisciplinary course in intrapreneurship. we talked to the program’s instructional and project directors about this unusual new course offering. françois pumir : half of this year’s cfee class are students from psl and the web school factory, while the other half are professionals from our partner businesses. the primary benefit of this training is that it gives the participants a new perspective and a set of methodologies for managing the digital transformation, which is exactly what those participants have been hoping to find. one of the essential ways we’re effecting the digital transformation is by putting people at the heart of every project. we encourage our students to adopt a user-centric approach and to tackle every issue in terms of what’s desirable rather than the more restrictive mindset – still so common in the business world – of what’s feasible. at this stage, everyone’s still very motivated, although the change in viewpoint has been a little disconcerting for some in the group. thibaut barbarin : the students and professionals in our class come from a wide array of backgrounds. they’re engineers, attorneys, managers, and so on. and within their work groups they may each take a similar approach, or they may clash. that’s proven very fertile; we can already see that the learning process will be much faster than in other programs.  launch of a course dedicated to intrapreneurship and digital transformation f.p. : right at the start of the semester, we held the cfee hack to serve as a real-world exercise. the class had six days to come up with new business models for some very established industries. it’s a difficult test, regardless of your age or experience, because you can’t simply fall back on an automatic response. the goal of the exercise is to give students the ability to sit down in front a corporate board or a group of lenders and offer a vision of a given topic that’s not just business-minded but user-centric, concrete and objective. the instructional team (professors, our partner business leaders, etc.) helped guide them through that first experience. it’s a shift in perspective that can be disconcerting, but it’s necessary in order to embrace the radically new vision of what the digital transformation can be. t.b. : the cfee hack was a really enlightening experience for everyone in the class about the need to learn more. ever since, they’ve been much more aware of the learning curve, they’re investing the time and they’re using that learning time more effectively.  that was also a very good learning experience for handling data. the digital transformation involves massive amounts of data, and in my view it’s pretty critical for every professional to get up to speed on those issues. f.p. : project-based instruction has been around since well before the cfee, but we’re changing the format and especially the objective, because our instructional approach involves lecturers (entrepreneurs/professors/experts), students, businesses and their employees all at once. the digital transformation projects we’re tackling aren’t just fictional case studies that illustrate some pedagogical point; they’re actual company projects, whose progress and results are discussed by each company’s executive committee. so there are serious issues at stake! the goal and the ambition we’ve set is to create spin-offs or business units, and employees are at the heart of that process of learning how to generate value. t.b. : when project-based instruction is used in conventional academic curricula, it often uses the pedagogical objective as the starting point, and the case studies they use may be real, but decades old. with the cfee, we’ve chosen to take a different approach: we start with what the company hopes to achieve and we join forces to provide the deliverables. f.p. : a very close relationship. as we said before, the cfee program is distinctive in that its work groups include students, practitioners, educators – there’s no disinterested support. everyone has a stake in the project’s success. that approach applies to the relationship with each company as well. companies get an update on their project’s progress every two weeks, and it’s not uncommon for the cfee teams to meet with the company’s executives and high-level managers over lunch to work on their projects. f.p. : for me, it’s someone who has a real desire to be an entrepreneur and the necessary determination to eliminate obstacles and find solutions. t.b. : someone who’s looking for something different. whether they’d like a more meaningful experience like so many people these days, or they’re simply interested in creating a start-up, it’s that sense of change that’s really important. my feeling is that management is becoming more horizontal these days, and an entrepreneurial mindset will be a key asset. f.p.: again, it’s not a typical learning experience, and above all we’re looking for people who can all be part of a single team. the oral interview will play a much bigger role in whether you’re accepted than your cv or cover letter. f.p. : they’ll be people who can strike the right balance within their organizations, whether they’re entrepreneurs, intrapreneurs or something else – the important thing is that they know how to make a commitment and prosper. fulfilling individual career goals is not what the cfee program is about. t.b. : they’ll be able to take responsibility for the decisions they make, and influence the people around them to help bring about change. this training really promises an exciting personal adventure. fruit de la collaboration entre l’université psl, l'innovation factory et la web school factory, le nouveau cursus cfee (campus formation etudiants entreprises) est une formation interdisciplinaire de 10 mois à l’intrapreneuriat, par la réalisation de projets concrets de transformation numérique. cfee allie l’excellence académique des établissements partenaires à une forte connexion au monde de l’entreprise et aux écosystèmes d’innovation. son ambition ? faire émerger une nouvelle génération de talents - managers, décideurs, entrepreneurs et intrapreneurs - à la pointe des problématiques d’innovation numérique. basé sur une pédagogie active, cfee offre dans un cadre stimulant en plein cœur de paris - le campus cfee - une opportunité de rencontres, d’apprentissage et de collaborations inédite entre étudiants et professionnels. a l’issue du cursus, cfee délivre un diplôme d’établissement \"intrapreneuriat et transformation numérique\" de l’université psl validant 60 crédits ects. consulter la fiche formation"},
